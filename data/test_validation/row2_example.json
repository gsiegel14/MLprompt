    "user_input": "Dr. Vandana L. Madhavan: A 30-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital for the third time in 4 weeks because of recurrent fever. The patient had been well until 4 weeks before the current presentation, when fever, dry cough, nasal congestion, and decreased intake of solid foods developed. The next day, while he was playing in a park with his siblings, he began limping. No trauma had preceded the onset of limping. The patient's parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient was afebrile. He was interactive but appeared tired and walked with a limp, favoring the left leg. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The white-cell count was 28,440 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 63 mm per hour (reference range, 9 to 14), and the C-reactive protein level 31.3 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0). Urinalysis was normal. Ultrasonography of the hip and radiography of the pelvis showed no abnormalities. Radiography of the chest revealed peribronchial cuffing and patchy perihilar opacities. The patient had persistent intermittent fevers, leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed multiple hypoechoic splenic lesions, measuring up to 6 mm in diameter. CT imaging showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and right hilar lymphadenopathy. The patient had a family history significant for an older brother who had received a diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection at 31 months of age.",
