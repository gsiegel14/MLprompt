    "user_input": "Dr. Neil D. Fernandes (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\nThe patient had been well until 17 months before this admission, when he began to have episodes of headache and neck pain multiple times per week after an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) accident. Two months later, the patient collided with another adolescent while he was playing soccer, and the episodes of headache and neck pain worsened. He rated the pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain.\nFifteen months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the pediatric clinic of another hospital. On examination, the pulse was 95 beats per minute and the blood pressure 117/78 mm Hg. There was mild tenderness in the area of the trapezius muscle. A radiograph of the cervical spine was normal. During the next 15 months, the patient was followed in the pediatric and neurology clinics of the other hospital. Ibuprofen, nortriptyline, sumatriptan, cyclobenzaprine, and diazepam were prescribed, but the headache did not abate. He underwent physical therapy, chiropractic adjustment, massage therapy, and acupuncture, but the symptoms persisted.\nThree months before this admission, nausea began to occur during the episodes of headache. The pain became more intense when the patient was lying down or was physically active, resulting in tunnel vision and vomiting; after he vomited, the pain became less intense. He was evaluated at the pediatric clinic of the other hospital. On examination, the pulse was 104 beats per minute and the blood pressure 128/80 mm Hg. At the recommendation of his physicians, the patient stopped participating in all sports.\nTwo days before this admission, the pain worsened and awoke the patient from sleep. The nausea was constant, and the vomiting occurred two times per day. The patient was unable to attend school because of the symptoms. His parents took him to the pediatric clinic of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 115 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 120/64 mm Hg. The height was 183.6 cm, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.0. The physical examination was normal. A probable diagnosis of mixed migraines and tension headaches was made. Prednisone, zolmitriptan, and ondansetron were prescribed, and the patient was sent home.\nOn the day of this admission, the patient had new severe pain on the right side of the abdomen that awoke him from sleep. The headache, neck pain, and nausea were constant. The patient was taken to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the blood pressure 239/162 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The white-cell count was 22,380 per microliter (reference range at other hospital, 3800 to 10,500), the lactic acid level 2.7 mmol per liter (24 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]), and the creatinine level 1.3 mg per deciliter (115 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [53 to 115 \u03bcmol per liter]). An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with increased R-wave and S-wave amplitudes in the precordial leads, as well as nonspecific repolarization abnormalities. One hour later, a repeat ECG showed an ectopic atrial rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions at a rate of 66 beats per minute.\nIntravenous hydromorphone, morphine, ondansetron, metoclopramide, and lactated Ringer\u2019s solution were administered. A nitroglycerin infusion was started, and the systolic blood pressure decreased to 143 mm Hg; the infusion was stopped, and the systolic blood pressure increased to 212 mm Hg. Intravenous labetalol was administered, and the systolic blood pressure decreased to 92 mm Hg. An esmolol infusion was started, and the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital, arriving 3 hours after presentation to the other hospital. Shortly after his arrival, the esmolol infusion was stopped.\nOn admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had played paintball a few days earlier but did not recall any direct trauma to the chest or abdomen. A review of systems was notable for heat intolerance and night sweats. He had a history of acne and had received a diagnosis of pneumonia involving the right upper lobe 10 months before this admission. He had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccines. His medications included doxycycline and topical tretinoin, clindamycin, and benzoyl peroxide, in addition to zolmitriptan and ondansetron; he had not started taking the recently prescribed prednisone. There were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents and younger brother. He performed well in high school. Before the recent progression of his symptoms, he had participated in soccer, basketball, and track. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He drank one or two alcoholic beverages per month. His father and paternal grandparents had hypertension, and his maternal aunts had migraines; his mother and brother were healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the pulse 126 beats per minute, the blood pressure 90/44 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He appeared tired, pale, and diaphoretic. He was in distress because of the pain; he spoke in brief sentences and had frequent hiccups. The abdomen was nondistended with marked tenderness in the right upper quadrant and right flank, with rebound and guarding. The skin was warm and clammy, and some inguinal hyperpigmentation was present. No caf\u00e9 au lait spots were noted.\nThe white-cell count was 27,140 per microliter (reference range at this hospital, 4500 to 13,000), the lactic acid level 3.4 mmol per liter (31 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]), the creatinine level 1.64 mg per deciliter (145 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the high-sensitivity troponin T level 188 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On hospital day 2, urinalysis revealed 1+ blood, trace ketones, a pH of 5.0, and a specific gravity of 1.015; microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed squamous cells, crystals, and mucin, as well as 3 to 5 hyaline casts per high-power field, less than 10 white cells per high-power field, and no red cells.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (This Hospital), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201313,000, 27,140\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20138100, 22,820\nLymphocytes, 1200\u20135200, 2330\nMonocytes, 200\u20131400, 1210\nEosinophils, 0\u20131000, 110\nBasophils, 0\u2013400, 550\n\nHematocrit (%), 37.0\u201349.0, 40.4  \nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.0\u201316.0, 13.0  \nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 278,000  \nLactic acid (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.0, 3.4  \nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 135  \nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 4.9  \nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 99  \nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 20  \nAnion gap (mmol/liter), 3\u201317, 16  \nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 21  \nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 1.64  \nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 241  \nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201340, 23  \nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 22  \nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 82\u2013331, 93  \nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 0.9  \n\nProtein (g/dl):\nTotal, 6.0\u20138.3, 6.1  \nAlbumin, 3.3\u20135.0, 3.6  \nGlobulin, 1.9\u20134.1, 2.5  \n\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 8.9  \nHigh-sensitivity troponin T (ng/liter), 0\u201314, 188\n\nA diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Mark A. Matza (Medicine): A 68-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of neurologic decline, progressive renal insufficiency, and leukopenia.\nSeven months before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital after routine laboratory testing had identified abnormalities, including a creatinine level of 3.2 mg per deciliter (283 mmol per liter; reference range, 0.50 to 1.40 mg per deciliter [44 to 124 mmol per liter]), a blood urea nitrogen level of 54 mg per deciliter (19 mmol per liter; reference range, 7 to 30 mg per deciliter [2.5 to 11 mmol per liter]), and a calcium level of 12.1 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.8 to 10.6 mg per deciliter [2.2 to 2.6 mmol per liter]). Twelve months earlier, the creatinine level had been 1.7 mg per deciliter (150 mmol per liter). On admission to the other hospital, he reported unintentional weight loss of 14 kg over the preceding 12 months, malaise, waking every 2 hours to empty his bladder, and new mild exertional dyspnea. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 117/74 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 68 kg and the body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 23.5. Examination was notable for cachexia and hepatosplenomegaly (with the liver and spleen palpable 6 cm below the costal margin) without lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. Blood levels of magnesium, bilirubin, globulin, creatine kinase, uric acid, and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal; urine protein electrophoresis revealed polyclonal light-chain bands.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults, First Hospital), On Admission (First Hospital, 7 Mo Before This Admission), Reference Range (Adults, Second Hospital), On Admission (Second Hospital, 9 Days Before This Admission), Reference Range (Adults, This Hospital), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nBlood\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.7\u201316.7, 12.3, 13.8\u201317.4, 10.6, 13.5\u201317.5, 9.2\nHematocrit (%), 38.1\u201350.1, 36.4, 41.0\u201351.0, 30.7, 41.0\u201353.0, 26.8\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 3800\u201310,050, 2120, 4400\u201311,300, 3000, 4500\u201311,000, 2740\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l)\nNeutrophils, \u2014, 1187, \u2014, 2790, 1800\u20137700, 2512\nLymphocytes, \u2014, 487, \u2014, 60, 1000\u20134800, 79\nMonocytes, \u2014, 402, \u2014, 90, 200\u20131200, 128\nEosinophils, \u2014, 0, \u2014, 0, 0\u2013900, 0\nImmature granulocytes, \u2014, 21, \u2014, 60, 0\u2013100, 19\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 125,000, 150,000\u2013450,000, 92,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 58,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 134\u2013145, 133, 134\u2013145, 135, 135\u2013145, 142\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.5\u20135.1, 4.0, 3.5\u20135.1, 4.4, 3.4\u20135.0, 3.3\nChloride (mmol/liter), 96\u2013108, 98, 96\u2013108, 96, 98\u2013108, 104\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 22\u201332, 19, 22\u201332, 21, 23\u201332, 22\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201328, 54, 8\u201328, 55, 8\u201325, 47\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.5\u20131.2, 3.2, 0.5\u20131.2, 3.4, 0.60\u20131.50, 2.96\nGlucose (mg/dl), 74\u2013118, 97, 74\u2013118, 96, 70\u2013110, 89\nPhosphorous (mg,dl), \nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 11.9, 8.5\u201310.5, 9.6, 8.5\u201310.5, 9.8\n25-Hydroxyvitamin D (ng/ml), 30\u2013100, 20, 30\u2013100, 20, 20\u201380, 25\nParathyroid hormone (pg/ml), 15\u201365, <6, 15\u201365, 17, 10\u201360, 7\nParathyroid hormone\u2013related peptide (pmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 3.5\n1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (pg/ml), 19.9\u201379.3, 71.8, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.2\u20137.9, 6.9, 6.2\u20137.9, 6.1, 6.0\u20138.3, 5.8\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.4\u20135.2, 3.9, 3.4\u20135.2, 3.6, 3.3\u20135.0, 3.1\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 0\u201365, 68, 0\u201365, 34, 10\u201355, 47\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 0\u201343, 89, 0\u201343, 27, 10\u201340, 23\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 29\u2013126, 259, 29\u2013126, 104, 45\u2013115, 138\nBone-specific alkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 6.5\u201320.1, 21.6, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nThyrotropin (\u00b5IU/ml), 0.27\u20134.20, 8.74, 0.30\u20134.50, 2.16, 0.4\u20135.0, 5.83\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201315, 13, \u2014, \u2014, 0\u201313, 46\nVitamin B12 (pg/ml), \u2014, \u2014, 300\u20132000, 201, >250, 738\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), \u2014, \u2014, <5.0, 54.4, <8.0, 140.0\nIron (\u00b5g/dl), \u2014, \u2014, 50\u2013160, 66, 45\u2013160, 13\nTotal iron-binding capacity (\u00b5g/dl), \u2014, \u2014, 250\u2013430, 178, 230\u2013404, 159\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), \u2014, \u2014, 41\u2013306, 776, 20\u2013300, 805\n\nUrine\nColor, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow\nClarity, Clear, Slightly cloudy, Clear, Clear, Clear, Clear\npH, 5.0\u20137.5, 5.0, 5.0\u20139.0, 6.0, 5.0\u20139.0, 5.0\nSpecific gravity, 1.001\u20131.035, 1.011, 1.001\u20131.035, 1.009, 1.001\u20131.035, 1.009\nGlucose, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative\nKetones, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative\nLeukocyte esterase, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, +1\nNitrite, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative\nProtein, Negative, 30 mg/dl, Negative, 30 mg/dl, Negative, Negative\nBlood, Negative, Large, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative\nRed cells (per high-power field), 0\u20132, >100, <2, 1, 0\u20132, 0\u20132\nWhite cells (per high-power field), <10, 0\u20135, <4, 6, 0\u20132, 5\u201310\nBacteria, None, Rare, None, Negative, None, None\n\nDr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed focal nodular soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta. Splenomegaly and left paraaortic adenopathy were present. Small pulmonary nodules and patchy consolidation were observed, along with a small left pleural effusion.\nDr. Matza: After treatment with intravenous normal saline and furosemide, the calcium level normalized and the creatinine level decreased to 2.3 mg per deciliter (203 mmol per liter). The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day.\nDr. Rory K. Crotty: A bone marrow biopsy performed 2 weeks later at the first hospital revealed hypercellular marrow and multiple nonnecrotizing granulomas. Staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungi was negative. No cultures were obtained.\nDr. Matza: The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 89 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 67). A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered, and therapy with high-dose oral prednisone was started.\nOne month later, the ACE level decreased to 41 U per liter, and the patient\u2019s energy level and appetite improved. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone were unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea.\nThree months later, the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the first hospital for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was initiated for prophylaxis against pneumocystis while the patient continued to receive high-dose prednisone. Tests of pulmonary function showed mild obstruction, with a clinically significant response after the use of a bronchodilator, and moderate restriction, with moderately reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. A second attempt to taper the dose of prednisone was unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea.\nDuring the next 2 months, intermittent confusion, progressive weakness in the legs, right foot drop, and increasing unsteadiness and gait instability developed; the patient began to use a walker to ambulate. He also had at least two falls. He required help from his wife to perform activities of daily living, including bathing and dressing.\nThe patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at the first hospital. Complement levels were normal, as was the level of rheumatoid factor. Tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Weekly treatment with oral methotrexate and folic acid was started for presumed sarcoidosis.\nEleven days later, the patient presented to a second hospital with a new facial droop on the left side, slurred speech, and confusion. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/86 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 63 kg and the BMI 21.9. The patient was oriented to person, place, and time; neurologic examination was notable for a mild facial droop on the left side, mildly increased muscle tone, right foot drop, and symmetric mild weakness in the arms and upper legs. Cachexia, tachycardia, and splenomegaly were noted. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a 12-mm right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm, a right cerebellar cavernous malformation, and numerous punctate foci (in the pons, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus) characterized by hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging and restricted diffusion.\nDr. Matza: Clopidogrel and levetiracetam were initiated. Echocardiography did not show intracardiac thrombus or shunting; carotid ultrasonography did not show stenosis. Electromyography revealed evidence of mild L5\u2013S1 radiculopathy and right ulnar and median neuropathy, but there was no evidence of myopathy or upper motor neuron disease. Owing to progressive leukopenia (white-cell count, 1390 per microliter) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 51,000 per microliter), methotrexate, clopidogrel, levetiracetam, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole were discontinued; cyanocobalamin was started.\nOn the fourth hospital day, a fever with a temperature of 38.3\u00b0C developed; specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were initiated. The C-reactive protein level was 101.8 mg per liter. Blood tests for ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid factor, influenza type A and B antigens, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen, antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core antibodies, cytomegalovirus DNA, Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA, and parvovirus IgM were negative, as were urine tests for legionella antigen and histoplasma antigen. A rapid plasma reagin test was negative, and an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was reported as indeterminate.\nDr. Shepard: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed scattered ground-glass opacities in the lungs, nodular and consolidative opacities in the lungs, mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, small pleural effusions, and splenomegaly (with the spleen measuring 16 cm in the cephalocaudad dimension; normal length, <13 cm). Focal soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta and prominence of the soft tissue surrounding the infrarenal abdominal aorta were also noted.\nThe next day, magnetic resonance angiography was performed. A T2-weighted fat-saturated image (Figure 1A) showed signal hyperintensity in the soft tissue around the infrarenal aorta and in the adjacent left paraaortic lymph nodes that was indicative of adenopathy, with a focal abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm seen on time-of-flight imaging (Figure 1B).\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Chest.\nDr. Matza: On the eighth hospital day, a bone marrow biopsy was performed. On the ninth day, the patient was transferred to this hospital.\nOn the patient\u2019s arrival, a review of systems was limited owing to delirium, and history was obtained in part from the patient\u2019s family. The review was notable for months of fatigue, malaise, leg weakness, right foot drop, waxing and waning confusion, exertional dyspnea, and an inability to walk and perform activities of daily living. Palpitations, dry cough, easy bruising, and irritable bladder were present, but he had no chills, anorexia, joint pain, erythema, rashes, nodules, myalgia, chest pain, dizziness, productive cough, hemoptysis, orthopnea, wheezing, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysuria, hematuria, ocular or nasal symptoms, skin or nail changes, or headache.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for hypothyroidism, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, progressive kidney disease, degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, scoliosis, tubular adenoma, and leukopenia. Eight years before this admission, a mass in the bladder that measured 4.5 cm by 4.0 cm was noted on ultrasonography, which had been performed for evaluation of hematuria. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed at another hospital, but the resection was reportedly incomplete. Histologic examination revealed non\u2013muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma. Repeat cystoscopy and transurethral resection, performed 3, 8, and 16 months after the initial procedures, each revealed fragments of non\u2013muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, and intravesical bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) was administered. Cystoscopy, performed 1 year before this admission for the management of bladder stones, identified a recurrent polypoid bladder tumor, which was treated with transurethral resection.\nOutpatient medications included prednisone, methotrexate, folic acid, aspirin, levothyroxine, simvastatin, tamsulosin, cholecalciferol, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, omeprazole, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, fluticasone\u2013salmeterol, and as-needed inhaled albuterol. Penicillin had caused an unknown reaction.\nThe patient was a retired pharmacist and lived with his wife. He had a remote history of smoking a half pack of cigarettes daily for 2 years and drank alcohol infrequently. He had not traveled recently and had had no environmental, animal, or toxic exposures. There was no family history of autoimmune, neurologic, infectious, or pulmonary disorders.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/76 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 54 kg and the BMI 18.8. He was anxious, cachectic, and appeared chronically ill. He correctly reported his name, location, and the time and date; however, he was unable to follow simple two-step commands. The cranial-nerve examination revealed a subtle facial droop on the left side. There were tremors in the arms and legs at rest and with motion, as well as right foot drop and diffusely increased tone. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing showed dysmetria. Bibasilar crackles (greater in the left lung than in the right) were heard on lung auscultation. Hepatosplenomegaly was present. There were diffuse ecchymoses on the trunk, arms, and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe international normalized ratio and blood levels of ammonia, bilirubin, creatine kinase, folic acid, globulin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, lactic acid, and magnesium were normal. The ACE level was 36 U per liter (reference range, 8 to 53). Serum protein electrophoresis showed no bands, but a mild, diffuse decrease in globulin was noted. The urine free kappa light-chain level was 134.2 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.4 to 15.1), and the urine free lambda light-chain level was 35.6 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.8 to 10.1), with a normal ratio (3.77; reference range, 0.50 to 4.00). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. During the first 3 days of this admission, the patient became lethargic; when he was awakened, his speech was incoherent and dysarthric.\nDr. Schaefer: On the third hospital day, MRI of the head (Figure 2) with magnetic resonance angiography revealed a stable right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm, as well as a stable right cerebellar cavernous malformation. There were punctate and patchy foci characterized by hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging and restricted diffusion in the midbrain, pons, medulla, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus; the foci had increased in size and extent from the previous study.\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Shepard: Positron-emission tomography (PET)\u2013CT (Figure 1D through 1F) revealed multiple foci of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in periaortic soft tissue and paraaortic lymph nodes, in the axial skeleton (cervical vertebral body, ribs, manubrium, and sacrum), and in the left testis.\nDr. Matza: Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan, coxiella antibodies, cytomegalovirus IgM and IgG, cryptococcal antigen, human chorionic gonadotropin, and Treponema pallidum antibodies were negative, as was a urine test for histoplasma antigen. Electroencephalographic monitoring showed frequent sharp, irregular delta and theta discharges; treatment with levetiracetam was started.\nOn the fourth hospital day, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C. Ultrasound images showed testes of normal size and echotexture without focal lesions, but the epididymides were enlarged and heterogeneous. The kidneys were normal in size, with diffusely echogenic parenchyma, and a 19-mm bladder stone was present. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function, no evidence of clinically significant valvular disease, and a mildly dilated aorta. Flow cytometry showed a markedly reduced CD4+ T-cell count (11 per microliter; reference range, 348 to 1456). Antibody tests for bartonella and brucella were negative.\nSomnolence progressed, and on the fifth hospital day, the right pupil was noted to be slightly larger than the left and the patient had increased tremor. Fosphenytoin therapy was initiated, and he was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit. The oxygen saturation declined to 90% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute, and a Cheyne\u2013Stokes pattern of respiration was observed. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated.\nA diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Dilara Hatipoglu (Medicine): A 33-year-old man was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of relapsing chronic diarrhea and a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy.\nDiarrhea had initially developed in the patient during infancy. When the patient was 2 months of age, he had poor growth and frequent bowel movements with loose stools. When he began to eat solid foods, diarrhea continued, and a hydrolyzed-protein diet was started. His parents were instructed to remove dairy, soy, and gluten from his diet, but diarrhea did not abate. Allergy skin-prick testing with cow\u2019s milk and soy antigens was negative.\nWhen the patient was 10 months of age, failure to thrive and diarrhea persisted, and generalized edema and nephrotic syndrome developed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and diffuse inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy reportedly showed mild degenerative changes of the surface epithelium and mild focal microvillous atrophy; there were no immune deposits, and the basement membrane was normal.\nRenal biopsy was also performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen revealed glomeruli with diffuse thickening of the basement membrane; there was no proliferation of cells or mesangial matrix. Transmission electron microscopy showed total effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes and an irregularly thickened glomerular basement membrane with numerous subepithelial and intramembranous electron-dense deposits. The patient received a working diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome due to membranous glomerulonephritis, and treatment with prednisone was started.\nDiarrhea abated, proteinuria and generalized edema resolved, and growth resumed. However, during the next 2 years, intermittent relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome occurred when the dose of prednisone was decreased. When the patient was 3 years of age, treatment with chlorambucil was started for recurrent membranous glomerulonephritis, and there were no relapses for 1 year.\nWhen the patient was 4 years of age, there was a recurrence of diarrhea associated with fever and hemolytic anemia. Stool culture, stool testing for Clostridioides difficile toxin, and examination of the stool for ova and parasites were all negative. EGD was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and active enteritis. The blood IgE level was 501 IU per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 100). The blood level of endomysial antibodies was not elevated, but anti\u2013epithelial cell antibodies were detected. The patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy, and treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was begun.\nAfter several months, treatment with glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was stopped, and tacrolimus was begun. Tacrolimus was stopped after several years, when the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved. From 5 to 13 years of age, he had no enteropathy, anemia, or nephropathy.\nBeginning at 13 years of age, the patient was hospitalized for recurrences of diarrhea and nephropathy every 2 to 4 years during the 20 years before this evaluation. Six years before this evaluation, EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the duodenal and colonic mucosa appeared diffusely edematous. Biopsy specimens were obtained.\nDr. Stuti G. Shroff: Examination of a duodenal biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed marked villous blunting, an increase in lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria (known as lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria), and a patchy increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. Examination of a colonic biopsy specimen revealed mild focal active colitis that spared the rectum.\nFIGURE 1\n\nSmall-Intestinal Biopsy Specimens.\nDr. Hatipoglu: Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was begun, and diarrhea abated. For the next 2 years, relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone in combination with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil.\nFour years before this evaluation, antibodies against the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor were not detected. Renal biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen again revealed evidence of membranous glomerulonephritis. Treatment was changed to prednisone, budesonide, and abatacept, and symptoms abated. After 2 years, the patient stopped taking abatacept. After another 2 years, diarrhea recurred, and the patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the gastroenterology clinic, additional history was obtained. There was a history of hypertension, gallstones, and rosacea. Eczema had developed when the patient was 10 months of age and had occurred intermittently into adulthood; it had abated with the administration of immunosuppressive agents. Anaphylactic shock had occurred when the patient was 2 years of age after he had been exposed to uncooked egg. At that time, allergy testing was performed, and the patient\u2019s parents were instructed to remove eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, and shellfish from his diet, in addition to removing dairy, soy, and gluten.\nCurrent medications included prednisone, budesonide, and losartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a Mid-Atlantic state and worked as a salesperson. He did not smoke tobacco and drank beer rarely. His family history included ovarian cancer in his mother and skin cancer in his father; his brother was healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/94 mm Hg, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.1. The patient had short stature and diffuse erythema of the face and neck. There was mild tenderness in the left lower abdomen. The results of a lactulose breath test were normal, as was the fecal calprotectin level. Testing for antibodies to tissue transglutaminase was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the findings were consistent with duodenitis, gastritis, and atrophy of the colon.

    "user_input": "Dr. Amy E. Armstrong-Javors: A 12-year-old boy with autism was admitted to this hospital because of decreased vision in both eyes.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 weeks before this admission, when he began to have difficulty seeing in both eyes. His vision was decreased when he woke up in the morning, improved throughout the day, and worsened again at night. Three weeks before the current admission, the patient told his parents about the vision changes. They took him to an optometry clinic for evaluation. Eyeglasses were not prescribed; a routine annual follow-up evaluation was scheduled.\nDuring the next 3 weeks, the patient noticed that the decrease in vision worsened. He typically walked on his toes and held onto his parents as he walked; however, 4 days before this admission, his parents noticed that he leaned on them heavily while walking. Two days before the current admission, they observed him walking into doors and walls and bumping into objects. On the day of this admission, the patient woke up screaming and panicked because he could not see. His parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported that his vision had improved slightly throughout the day. He described darkening of his vision that was worse in the left eye than in the right eye. He was having difficulty identifying movement and details of objects, although he was able to see shapes and colors. The parents reported that the patient had been having puffiness and crusting of the eyes for 2 days, with no eye redness or pain. Review of systems was notable for 3 days of diarrhea and nausea. He had no fever, headache, rashes, mouth sores, joint pain, or weakness.\nThe patient was born prematurely, at 7 months\u2019 gestation. Labor and delivery had taken place outside the hospital setting, and perinatal hypoxia had occurred. The patient had been taken urgently to another hospital, where he was resuscitated and then hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit for 2 months. The patient had autism and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He had developmental delays in speech, language, cognition, and fine motor skills. He had received all routine childhood vaccinations and was taking risperidone; there were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived with his parents and older sister, all of whom were healthy. Ten months before this admission, they had moved from an urban area to a rural area in New England. The patient was in sixth grade and was enrolled in special education classes at school. He had been an avid player of video and virtual reality games, but his parents had removed the gaming systems from their home 2 months before the patient\u2019s vision changes had begun. He continued to watch videos on the computer and television; his parents noted that he did not sit close to the devices and sometimes looked at the wall instead of the screen. The patient\u2019s parents described him as a \u201cpicky eater.\u201d His diet consisted almost exclusively of hamburgers, french fries, ranch dressing, glazed doughnuts, and juice boxes. The patient avoided trying new foods and did not take vitamin pills or gummies because he disliked the taste or texture.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 104/71 mm Hg, the heart rate 94 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 156 cm (70th percentile), the weight 40.3 kg (38th percentile), and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 16.6. The patient was pale, alert, interactive, and wary of the physical examination.\nDr. Ryan A. Gise: Mild periorbital swelling was present. The visual acuity in both eyes was limited to hand motion. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, and the extraocular movements were full. Color-vision testing, automated perimetry, fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography could not be performed because the patient had poor vision and was unable to cooperate. A slit-lamp examination was notable only for keratinization of the conjunctiva in both eyes. A funduscopic examination revealed pallor of the optic disk in both eyes. Examination of the peripheral retina was limited because the patient was unable to cooperate.\nDr. Armstrong-Javors: Strength, sensation, reflexes, and coordination were normal. A gait examination revealed toe walking; the patient asked for assistance when walking. The abdomen was nontender. Horizontal ridges were present on the toenails (Figure 1), and there were scattered bruises on the arms and legs. No ulcers or rashes were seen. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photograph of the Toenails.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range, On Admission\n\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201313,500, 5700\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.0\u201316.0, 12.3\nHematocrit (%), 37.0\u201349.0, 37.0\nMean corpuscular volume (g/dl), 78.0\u201398.0, 89.4\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 216,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 137\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 4.1\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 104\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 20\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 5\u201320, 6\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.38\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 77\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201340, 17\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 20\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 129\u2013417, 422\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 0.4\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 3.6\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.0\u20138.3, 5.9\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 17.1\nProthrombin-time international normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.4\n\nDr. Camilo Jaimes: During the next 2 days, imaging was attempted but limited because the patient was anxious about the testing. On the third hospital day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits, with and without the intravenous administration of contrast material, was successfully performed while the patient was under sedation (Figure 2). A fluid-sensitive short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence showed subtle hyperintensity of the mid-intraorbital segments of the optic nerves in both eyes, with no enhancement. The optic chiasm, optic tracts, and optic-nerve sheath complexes appeared normal. Diffuse heterogeneous thickening of the calvarium was present.\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head and Orbits.\nDr. Armstrong-Javors: Diagnostic tests were performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Philippe-Antoine Bilodeau (Medicine): A 21-year-old man presented to this hospital with a sore throat, epistaxis, and petechiae of the oropharynx.\nOne week before the current presentation, blood-filled blisters developed inside the patient\u2019s mouth, on the buccal mucosa. He had occasional bleeding from the mouth that resolved spontaneously. He consulted with his dentist, who was concerned about the possibility of impacted wisdom teeth. Two days before the current presentation, a sore throat developed. There was no difficulty with swallowing. On the day of the current presentation, epistaxis developed and did not resolve over a period of 2 hours.\nThe patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 142/76 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. He had blood in the nares and petechiae on the soft palate. There was a large ecchymosis on the left forearm that the patient attributed to carrying heavy boxes several days earlier. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), a platelet count of 1000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000), and a white-cell count of 670 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). The absolute neutrophil count was 50 per microliter (reference range, 1800 to 7000). Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of tests for coagulation, renal function, and liver function. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

There was no fever, weight loss, rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The patient had a history of sickle cell trait. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He had been living with his parents and younger brother since he had left his college campus at the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. He worked in a grocery store, and his only known sick contact was his mother, who had been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2 months earlier. She had been isolated in a room in their home during her illness. The patient did not have any symptoms associated with Covid-19 and had never been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. His father and brother had been well. The family lived adjacent to a wooded region, and the patient had been hiking in northern New England 2 months before the current presentation. He had not noticed any tick bites. He had no animal contacts. The patient was born in Central America and had moved to a suburban region of New England at 3 years of age. He had previously traveled to Mexico and Canada. He was sexually active with female partners only. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and paternal family members had sickle cell disease.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well. There were petechiae on the soft palate (Figure 1). There was no scleral icterus, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly. A large ecchymosis was present on the left forearm. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of folate and cobalamin were normal, as were results of serum protein electrophoresis and the ratio of free kappa to lambda light chains. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A radiograph of the chest and an ultrasound image of the upper abdomen were normal, without splenomegaly. Testing of a specimen obtained from the nasopharynx was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA; the patient was admitted to the hospital and placed in enhanced isolation. Examination of thick and thin peripheral-blood smears for babesia was negative.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photograph.\nA second unit of platelets was transfused, and a diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Peiyun Ni (Medicine): A 63-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of fever, headache, sore throat, and confusion.\nThe patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when fever, chills, myalgias, and headache developed. She also had sore throat, odynophagia, and the feeling of a \u201clump\u201d in the neck. The patient was concerned that she had coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and sought evaluation at an urgent care clinic of another hospital. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative, and she was instructed to quarantine at home.\nFive days before this admission, the patient returned to the clinic of the other hospital because of persistent symptoms, including daily fevers. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, and the remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. Testing of another nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, as was testing of an oropharyngeal swab for the rapid detection of streptococcal antigen.\nOn the day of admission, the patient\u2019s sister visited the patient and noticed that she had difficulty with word finding and performing basic tasks at home. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported fevers, chills, myalgias, fatigue, generalized weakness, headaches, sore throat, and odynophagia. She acknowledged that she had mild confusion and \u201cmental slowness\u201d of 2 weeks\u2019 duration. A review of systems was notable for a lump in the neck, poor appetite, unintentional weight loss of 3 kg in the past 2 weeks, and anosmia for the past year, with onset before the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. There was no neck stiffness, photophobia, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria.\nThe patient had hypertension for which she took amlodipine and lisinopril; there were no known drug allergies. She was born in South America and had immigrated to the United States two decades earlier. She lived in an urban area of New England with her mother and son. Her son had a brain injury and was seen by visiting nurses daily; one nurse had had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test 4 days before this evaluation. There were no other sick contacts. The patient worked in management and enjoyed gardening as a hobby. She had no recent insect bites or travel. Although she had not been sexually active for several years, she had had an episode of unprotected sexual intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks before this evaluation. She smoked four cigarettes daily and had done so for 40 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThe temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 160/80 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.9. The patient appeared fatigued and was alert and oriented. She was unable to perform simple calculations, to list the days of the week in reverse order, or to follow two-step commands. The mucous membranes were dry, and a small nontender lymph node was palpable in the posterior neck on the left side. The white-cell count was 3700 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); the aspartate aminotransferase level was 280 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32) and the alanine aminotransferase level 235 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed the presence of ketones, nitrites, and protein; there were fewer than 10 white cells per high-power field (reference range, <10). Testing of a third nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, and blood specimens were obtained for culture.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Admission\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201316.0, 14.2\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 42.2\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 3700\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 2290\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 1320\nMonocytes, 200\u20131200, 60\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 230,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 131\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 4.8\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 93\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 127\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.92\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 8\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201332, 280\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201333, 235\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 30\u2013100, 205\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 0.3\nDirect bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20130.4, <0.2\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 4.5\nGlobulin (g/dl), 1.9\u20134.1, 3.0\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/liter), 110\u2013210, 466\n\nDr. William A. Mehan: A radiograph of the chest was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed prominent gastrohepatic, periportal, periaortic, and inguinal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.4 cm in diameter.\nCT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed mild scattered hypodensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the intravenous administration of contrast material, was notable for multifocal patchy hyperintensities throughout the juxtacortical and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, without corresponding restricted diffusion or abnormal enhancement (Figure 1). The findings were unchanged from MRI findings obtained 3 months before presentation.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Ni: Empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and acyclovir was started, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.\nA lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 24 cm of water; the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless. On CSF analysis, the total protein level was 201 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the glucose level 43 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). There were 73 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 65% were lymphocytes, 29% plasma cells, and 6% monocytes. Gram\u2019s staining showed abundant mononuclear cells and no organisms. The intravenous administration of ceftriaxone and acyclovir was stopped.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Gregory M. Cote: A 52-year-old man with a metastatic solitary fibrous tumor was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 1.5 years before the current admission, when dysuria and pain in the lower abdomen and left leg developed after a motor vehicle accident. At another hospital, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reportedly revealed an incidental 14-cm necrotic mass in the pelvis, anterior to the bladder. Biopsy of the mass was reportedly diagnostic of a solitary fibrous tumor.\nThe patient was referred to the multidisciplinary oncology clinic of this hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed for staging, revealed two 9-mm nodules in the left lung. The patient was treated with a 3-month course of dacarbazine chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy targeting the pelvic mass, and then he underwent surgical resection of the pelvic tumor, including partial cystectomy and placement of a ureteral stent. Pathological examination of the resected specimen (Figure 1) confirmed the diagnosis of spindle-cell sarcoma with features consistent with a dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumor. Immunohistochemical staining of the resected specimen revealed signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and CD34 in the tumor cells. Stereotactic radiation therapy for the lung nodules was also administered.\nFIGURE 1\n\nSpecimen of the Resected Mass.\nHowever, metastatic disease progressed in the lungs, chest, bladder, and right leg. Over the subsequent 12-month period, the patient underwent serial treatment with four different chemotherapeutic regimens: pazopanib, doxorubicin with olaratumab, gemcitabine with docetaxel, and vinorelbine. Palliative radiation therapy for a painful leg metastasis was also provided.\nEleven days after the initiation of vinorelbine chemotherapy and 30 days before the current admission, the patient was admitted to this hospital with fever (temperature, 38.3\u00b0C), neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, 770 per microliter; reference range, 1800 to 7700), and pneumonia in the left lower lobe.\nDr. Reece J. Goiffon: CT of the chest and abdomen (Figure 2A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed known metastatic involvement of the lungs, bladder, retroperitoneum, peritoneum, skeletal muscles, and subcutaneous fat. There was no metastatic involvement of the adrenal glands, pancreas, or liver.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Cote: Empirical treatment with cefepime was administered. Over the next several days, the neutropenia and fever resolved and the pneumonia abated. On the seventh hospital day, the patient was discharged home with a follow-up visit scheduled in the oncology clinic.\nEleven days after hospital discharge and 12 days before the current admission, the patient attended a scheduled outpatient visit for an infusion. He reported weakness and appeared confused. A fingerstick glucose level was 47 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter). Supplemental oral and intravenous glucose was administered, and his mental status improved, but fingerstick glucose levels remained below 70 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter). Review of fingerstick glucose measurements obtained during the patient\u2019s recent hospitalization showed multiple levels ranging from 50 to 60 mg per deciliter (2.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter).\nThe patient was admitted to the oncology unit of this hospital for the management of hypoglycemia. Laboratory test results from the second hospital admission are shown in Table 1. While the patient was in the hospital, he began to have diaphoresis that correlated with episodes of hypoglycemia, for which he received orange juice and dextrose. On evaluation by a dietitian, he was found to be meeting anticipated caloric requirements. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day; the blood glucose level was 55 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter) before discharge.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), 12 Days before Current Admission (Second Admission Day 1), 11 Days before Current Admission (Second Admission Day 2), 6 Days before Current Admission (Follow-up Visit), Current Admission Day 1, Current Admission Day 2\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 7.5, 6.8, 8.0, 7.9, 7.4\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 23.7, 21.7, 25.0, 24.8, 23.6\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 6350, 5390, 6740, 11,120, 6330\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 106,000, 85,000, 87,000, 91,000, 74,000\n\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 134, 136, 137, 139, 139\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 3.3, 3.4, 4.3, 4.0, 3.8\nChloride (mmol/liter), 100\u2013108, 97, 100, 101, 106, 105\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 25, 23, 26, 23, 21\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 3, 3, 6, 4, 3\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.44, 0.32, 0.39, 0.40, 0.50\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 68, 45, 96, 49, 145\nPhosphorus (mg/dl), 2.6\u20134.5, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 3.6, 3.8\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 8.8, 8.7, 8.7, 9.8, 9.0\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 2.8, \u2014, 3.0, 3.1, \u2014\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 7, \u2014, 6, 10, \u2014\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201340, 22, \u2014, 20, 18, \u2014\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013115, 65, \u2014, 72, 72, \u2014\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 0.6, \u2014, 0.5, 0.6, \u2014\nInsulin (\u00b5U/ml), 2.6\u201325.0, \u2014, <0.2, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nC\u2011peptide (ng/ml), 1.1\u20134.4, \u2014, <0.1, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\n\u03b2\u2011Hydroxybutyrate (mmol/liter), <0.4, \u2014, <0.1, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nCortisol, morning (\u00b5g/dl), 5.0\u201325.0, \u2014, 13.5, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nRepeat cortisol, after cosyntropin (\u00b5g/dl), \u2014, \u2014, 21.7, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nLactate (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.2, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.9, \u2014\nTroponin T (ng/ml), <0.03, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, <0.01, \u2014\n\nThree days later and 6 days before the current admission, the patient attended the scheduled follow-up visit in the oncology clinic. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with trabectedin was initiated, along with pegfilgrastim and a 3-day tapering course of dexamethasone. The day after the dexamethasone course was completed, the patient reported increased fatigue and cough. Two days later, he was admitted to the oncology unit because of weakness and diaphoresis; a fingerstick glucose level was 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter).\nOn the current admission, review of systems was notable for fatigue; pain associated with tumors involving the back, shoulders, and right leg; numbness of the right leg; the use of an indwelling Foley catheter for 2 months owing to urinary retention; dull chest pain and intermittent dyspnea that had persisted for 4 months; and constipation. The patient had no recent anorexia, weight change, fever, chills, orthopnea, hemoptysis, light-headedness, dizziness, palpitations, syncope, nausea, or vomiting.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for transfusion-dependent anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (for which he had received metformin, although not in the previous 6 months), hypertension, a colonic tubular adenoma, a renal cyst, osteoarthritis, chronic low-back pain, and depression. He had undergone an appendectomy in the remote past. Medications included oral gabapentin, cyanocobalamin, tamsulosin, and finasteride; transdermal fentanyl; and oral acetaminophen, clonazepam, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and oxycodone as needed. He had no access to insulin or other hypoglycemic medications. There were no known adverse drug reactions.\nThe patient had formerly worked as a laborer and had been receiving disability benefits since the motor vehicle accident. He had previously consumed six beers per week and smoked one pack of cigarettes per day, but he had stopped drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco 1 year earlier. There was no history of other substance use. His family history of cancer included melanoma in his father, thyroid cancer in his sister, ovarian cancer in his maternal grandmother, leukemia in his maternal aunt, and sarcoma in his paternal uncle. His mother had hypertension and dyslipidemia, and a brother had diabetes. The patient had an adult child, who was healthy.\nThe tympanic temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Multiple tender, palpable masses were present, including masses on the left shoulder, neck, and left upper leg. A venous-access port was in place in the chest wall on the right side. The abdominal incision was well healed. A Foley catheter was in place, and there was pink-tinged urine. A faint rash was present on the lower abdomen at the site of previous radiation therapy. Edema was present in both legs. Laboratory test results from the current hospital admission are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Goiffon: A chest radiograph (Figure 2B) showed abundant metastatic pulmonary nodules. CT of the chest (Figure 2C and 2D), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed that the nodules had increased in size and quantity over a period of 1 month. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.\nDr. Cote: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, a leftward axis, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and intraventricular conduction delay.\nOn the first hospital day, although the patient was receiving a continuous infusion of dextrose, five bolus injections of dextrose and six glasses of orange juice were needed to increase the blood glucose level to more than 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter). On the morning of the second hospital day, the blood glucose level was 42 mg per deciliter (2.3 mmol per liter). Treatment with oral prednisone was initiated.\nA diagnosis was made.",

Andrews (Medicine): A 73-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent fever.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 22 months before the current presentation, when 2 days of fever, cough, and fatigue developed. The patient sought evaluation at a primary care clinic affiliated with another hospital. Empirical oral antibiotic agents were administered to treat pneumonia. During the subsequent month, the cough resolved but fever recurred intermittently. The patient returned to the primary care clinic.\nDr. Rory L. Cochran: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed scattered solid pulmonary nodules, a few hepatic hemangiomas, and bilobar subcentimeter hepatic hypodensities (Figure 1A). There was borderline splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 13.0 cm in length (reference range, <13.2), and there was no lymphadenopathy.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nOne week later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen (Figure 1B) revealed that the hepatic lesions, which appeared hyperintense on T2-weighted images with enhancement, had increased in number and size, measuring up to 2.4 cm in diameter. Some lesions were only enhanced peripherally, a finding that suggested central necrosis.\nDr. Andrews: A bone marrow biopsy and a liver biopsy were performed.\nDr. Emad I. Ababneh: Pathological examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen reportedly revealed normocellular bone marrow and rare nonnecrotizing granulomas. Pathological examination of the liver-biopsy specimen showed prominent portal histiocytosis and portal and lobular nonnecrotizing granulomas (Figure 2A), with detached neutrophilic aggregates; a few of these foci were fibrin-ring granulomas (Figure 2B). Special staining for acid-fast bacilli, Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver staining, and Brown\u2013Hopps staining were negative for organisms. Immunohistochemical staining for cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and spirochetes was negative. Langerin staining for Langerhans\u2019 cells was negative.\nFIGURE 2\n\nSpecimens from Liver and Bone Marrow Biopsies.\nDr. Andrews: Twenty months before the current presentation, the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital because of 2 days of intermittent fever, which often occurred with chills, night sweats, and abdominal discomfort.\nBefore the onset of this illness, the patient had no history of recurrent fever or severe bacterial infections. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease that had led to percutaneous coronary intervention of three vessels 12 years before the current presentation. He also had a history of hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and gallstone pancreatitis that had led to a cholecystectomy 9 years earlier. Medications included rosuvastatin, aspirin, ferrous sulfate, and a multivitamin. He had no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his wife and pet cats and finches. He was a veteran who had been stationed in Guam, Thailand, and Japan, as well as in Vietnam 5 decades before the current presentation. He had traveled to the Southwest and Southeast regions of the United States 2 years before the current presentation. The patient was retired and had previously worked in the food-services industry. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, and he did not use alcohol or illicit drugs. His family history included idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, psoriasis, granuloma annulare, and chronic pancreatitis in his siblings. His son had iritis. There was no family history of frequent infections or early childhood deaths.\nThe temporal temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the pulse 79 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The lungs were clear on auscultation. He had mild tenderness in the epigastrium, as well as splenomegaly. Leukopenia and anemia were present. The levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme, 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan, and galactomannan were normal. Testing for infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B and C viruses was negative. Testing for infection with Chlamydia psittaci and Coxiella burnetii was also negative, as was testing for brucellosis, bartonellosis, listeriosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, malaria, babesiosis, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and ehrlichiosis.

There was also splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 13.5 cm in length.\nDr. Ababneh: Pathological examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen (Figure 2C) and of a specimen obtained on fine-needle aspiration of the liver showed nonnecrotizing granulomas like those seen on the previous liver biopsy. Cytologic examination of the specimens and flow cytometry of the peripheral blood were normal.\nDr. Andrews: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed no valvular vegetations. Empirical doxycycline therapy was started, and the patient was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent 19 months, the patient continued to have intermittent fever, chills, and epigastric pain, which led to additional admissions to this hospital and the other hospital. During the second admission to this hospital, 19 months before this admission, empirical doxycycline therapy was stopped, and empirical prednisone therapy was started, along with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.\nDr. Cochran: During the third admission, 18 months before this admission, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed worsening splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 14.2 cm in length, and hepatic lesions that had increased in size and number. A percutaneous drain was placed in the largest hepatic lesion (Figure 1D), which measured 4.0 cm in diameter.\nDr. Andrews: Bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures of the drained fluid did not grow organisms; however, culture of the blood showed growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy, which revealed gastritis, esophagitis, and diverticulosis. Treatment with prednisone and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was stopped, intravenous ceftriaxone was started, and he was discharged home.\nThe patient\u2019s fourth and fifth admissions occurred at the other hospital 17 months and 16 months before this admission, respectively. During the fourth admission, another percutaneous drain was placed in a dominant hepatic lesion, and cultures reportedly resulted in no growth. The patient received a course of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. During the fifth admission, cultures again reportedly showed no growth. The patient received another course of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and was discharged home with instructions to restart empirical doxycycline therapy.\nDr. Cochran: The sixth admission also occurred at the other hospital, 1 month before this admission. CT of the abdomen revealed numerous new and enlarged hypodense hepatic lesions with new scattered subcentimeter splenic hypodensities (Figure 1E).\nDr. Abahneh: Another liver biopsy was performed, which revealed liver parenchyma with abscess, acute inflammation and debris, and histiocytic and stromal reaction with histiocytic aggregates. Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver staining showed few bacteria, and a culture grew Escherichia coli; no acid-fast bacilli or fungal forms were detected.\nDr. Andrews: Treatment with doxycycline was stopped, intravenous ceftriaxone was started, and the patient was discharged home with instructions to start taking ciprofloxacin. During the subsequent month, fever did not abate. The patient returned to this hospital for a seventh admission.\nDr. Cochran: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed stable scattered solid pulmonary nodules, new interstitial pulmonary edema, and increased splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 15.0 cm in length. There was also an increase in the size and number of the hepatic and splenic hypodensities (Figure 1F).\nDr. Andrews: The patient underwent EGD, which showed portal hypertensive gastropathy. TTE showed no vegetations. Aspiration of a hepatic lesion was performed, and a culture grew Enterococcus faecalis. Treatment with amoxicillin was started.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Stephanie Lin-Beckford (Medicine): A 37-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a rash.\nThe patient had been well until 9 days before this admission, when a diffuse rash developed on the hands and feet. During the next 3 days, the rash spread proximally to the arms and the legs, then extended to the groin, trunk, and face. Six days before this admission, the patient noticed new throat tightness and lip swelling. Three days before this admission, when difficulty with swallowing and shortness of breath developed, the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital.\nOn evaluation at the other hospital, the patient reported that he had received an mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine on the day before the rash appeared. Vital signs and results of routine laboratory tests were reportedly normal. Treatment with dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, famotidine, and intravenous fluids was administered. The patient was discharged home.\nDuring the next 3 days, the symptoms did not abate. On the day of this admission, the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. He described having difficulty with opening his mouth because of pain in his lips, as well as mild difficulty with swallowing and breathing. The rash had become more confluent over the arms, legs, chest, back, face, and groin, and there was increased redness and swelling. The patient described the rash as mildly itchy and painful and stated that the affected skin felt \u201ctight.\u201d A review of systems was notable for fatigue, malaise, chills, and night sweats, as well as intermittent nausea, abdominal pain, watery stools, and dysuria. He had no fever, headache, cough, myalgias, or arthralgias.\nThe patient had no known medical conditions, took no medications, and had no known drug allergies. He was born in coastal South America and had immigrated to the United States 17 years before this admission. He lived in suburban New England with extended family members and had no pets; he had not traveled recently and had no known sick contacts. The patient worked in environmental services and wore gloves whenever he used cleaning products. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years; he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He was sexually active and reported that his last episode of unprotected sexual intercourse had been with a female partner 2 years before this admission. No family members had autoimmune diseases or skin conditions.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 105 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/92 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was fissuring at the oral commissures, and the posterior oropharynx had a cobblestone appearance; no mucosal lesions were noted. There was no conjunctival injection. The lungs were clear on auscultation. No joint swelling or cervical lymphadenopathy was present, but he had nontender bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Morbilliform macules, papules, and plaques were observed on the arms, legs, chest, back, face, scalp, groin, and penis (Figure 1). The rash became confluent at the dorsa and palms of the hands and at the dorsa and soles of the feet. No skin sloughing, erosions, ulcers, vesicles, or bullae were present. The complete blood count, blood levels of electrolytes, and results of tests of kidney and liver function were normal. The C-reactive protein level was 16.7 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 30 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13). Urinalysis was normal.

    "user_input": "Dr. Prashanth Rajarajan (Neurology): A 78-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of progressive confusion and evolving changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 months before the current admission, when she began to have a flat affect, which the patient\u2019s daughter had attributed to grief after the death of the patient\u2019s sister. The patient had a 3-year history of mild problems with memory, but more severe memory issues had developed along with the change in affect. Four months before the current admission, she was admitted to another hospital after an acute episode of word-finding difficulty that had been witnessed by her daughter.\nDr. Saurabh Rohatgi: At that time, MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1A and 1B), revealed a subcentimeter focus of high signal intensity in the right frontal lobe on diffusion-weighted sequences and \u201cpseudonormalization\u201d on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient, with corresponding T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showing hyperintensity consistent with subacute infarction. T2-weighted FLAIR images also showed multiple foci of hyperintensity (measuring up to 1.1 cm in diameter) in both cerebellar hemispheres that were consistent with chronic infarcts. In addition, multiple areas of hyperintensity were seen on T2-weighted FLAIR images in the periventricular, deep, and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres; these findings were suggestive of small-vessel disease. Gradient-echo sequences showed several punctate foci of susceptibility in a lobar distribution, findings that were consistent with chronic microhemorrhages. Magnetic resonance angiography (Figure 1C) showed normal intracranial arteries.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI and Magnetic Resonance Angiography of the Head.\nDr. Rajarajan: Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function, dilatation of the atria and right ventricle, moderate mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and no evidence of intracardiac shunting. Treatment with aspirin was started, and the patient was discharged home on hospital day 3 with a plan for extended outpatient cardiac monitoring.\nTen days after discharge, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. The patient\u2019s daughter, who had been living with her since discharge from the hospital because she did not think that the patient was safe living alone, accompanied her to the appointment. The patient\u2019s daughter reported that the patient had been impulsive and occasionally confused, as well as progressively more forgetful. Attention and focus were impaired, and the patient had to be redirected during the interview. The remainder of the examination was normal. Treatment with mirtazapine was started for possible depression. Electroencephalography (EEG) was scheduled to rule out seizure with a postictal state as a cause of confusion. However, owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the EEG was canceled.\nDuring the next 14 weeks, the patient needed progressively more assistance with activities of daily living, including multiple reminders to eat meals and help with bathing. Her episodes of confusion occurred mostly at night. When these episodes began to increase in frequency, the patient\u2019s daughter brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nThe patient had difficulty recalling past and recent events, and additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s daughter. The patient had had an 11-kg weight loss during the preceding 3 months that the daughter had attributed to an improved diet while they were living together. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, emphysema, sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, and obesity. Stage II infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast had been diagnosed 17 years before the current admission and had been treated with lumpectomy and chemoradiation therapy, followed by 3 years of treatment with tamoxifen and exemestane. The patient continued to undergo surveillance with alternating mammography and MRI of the breasts every 6 months; the last breast MRI, which had been performed 5 months before the current admission, showed normal results. Stage 1 adenocarcinoma of the lung had been diagnosed 14 years before the current admission and had been treated with surgical resection. The patient continued to undergo surveillance with annual computed tomography (CT) of the chest; the last CT of the chest, which had been performed 13 months before the current admission, showed a stable nodule in the right upper lobe that measured 7 mm in diameter.\nMedications included esomeprazole, dulaglutide, hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, losartan, metformin, rosuvastatin, inhaled fluticasone, inhaled formoterol, and as-needed treatment with ipratropium\u2013albuterol delivered by nebulizer. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was retired and had previously worked as a nurse. She was divorced and had lived independently in New England until she was hospitalized 4 months before the current admission. She drank alcohol occasionally and had a 75-pack-year smoking history and quit after lung cancer was diagnosed. Her mother had had coronary artery disease, and her father had had emphysema.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 162/71 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 167.6 cm, the weight 91.3 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.4. The patient was alert and interactive; she was oriented to name only. She was inattentive and tangential in conversation, with perseveration. Her speech was fluent without paraphasic errors. Cranial-nerve function was normal. Test results for strength, sensation, deep-tendon reflexes, and cerebellar function were normal.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, thyrotropin, cobalamin, lactate dehydrogenase, cortisol, and C-reactive protein were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function and coagulation. The complete blood count and differential count were normal except for the level of hemoglobin, which was 10.2 g per liter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 35 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). Screening tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative, as was an interferon-\u03b3 release assay to detect previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Rohatgi: Chest radiography showed bibasilar patchy opacities. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new symmetric, confluent signal hyperintensity in the bilateral hippocampi, amygdala, and medial and anterior temporal lobes on T2-weighted and FLAIR images (Figure 1D and 1E). There was no evidence of acute or subacute infarction or associated abnormal enhancement. Multiple punctate foci of susceptibility were seen in a predominantly lobar distribution in both cerebral hemispheres on susceptibility-weighted imaging (Figure 1F) \u2014 a finding that was suggestive of microhemorrhages. New hemosiderin staining was present within the sulci of the right parietal lobe.\nDr. Rajarajan: A lumbar puncture was performed for evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which was clear and colorless. In the third tube of CSF, there were 3 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5) and 8 red cells per microliter (reference value, 0). The CSF level of protein was 47 mg per deciliter (reference range, 8 to 32) and the glucose level 112 mg per deciliter (6.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 40 to 70 mg per deciliter [2.2 to 3.9 mmol per liter]). The concurrent blood level of glucose was 191 mg per deciliter (10.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 74 to 100 mg per deciliter [4.1 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). There were 16 oligoclonal bands (reference range, 0 to 1); an IgG index was not obtained. No organisms were seen on Gram\u2019s staining, and nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA was negative. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\nAn EEG showed diffuse delta and theta slowing and disorganization of the background. There were abundant bilateral independent, temporal epileptiform discharges as well as brief runs of independent, lateralized periodic discharges in both temporal lobes.\nDiagnostic tests were performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Andrew F. Cohen (Pediatrics): A 10-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of vomiting, weight loss, and hypercalcemia.\nThe patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when projectile vomiting began to occur once every few days, typically after eating solid foods. The vomiting did not seem to bother the patient, and he immediately returned to his normal activity after each episode. During the subsequent 12 days, the vomiting became more frequent, occurring daily, and had begun to occur after drinking liquids as well.\nTwo days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the pediatric primary care clinic of this hospital. On examination, the weight was 7.36 kg (0.4th percentile for his age) (Figure 1). The patient appeared alert, attentive, and comfortable but thin. The abdomen was soft, without distention or tenderness, and there was no evidence of organomegaly or masses on palpation. The skin was diffusely dry with excoriations. Treatment with omeprazole was started.\nFIGURE 1\n\nGrowth Curves.\nOver the course of the next 2 days, the patient lost interest in eating solid food and preferred milk and water. He gagged at the sight of food. The frequency of the vomiting had increased, occurring after the patient ate or drank anything.\nOn the day of this admission, the patient refused to take any food by mouth. His parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival, his parents reported that in the previous 2 weeks, he had had normal activity, wet diapers, and daily soft stools. They also noted that he always seemed thirsty, and when given liquid, he would drink a lot. At times, he would even suck the water out of the washcloths that were used to bathe him.\nThe patient had been born after induction of labor at 38 weeks\u2019 gestation owing to maternal gestational hypertension. He had received routine newborn care and met normal developmental milestones. He maintained normal growth for his age until an evaluation at 9 months of age, when the weight was 7.44 kg (1.6th percentile), and the body length was 68.2 cm (6.5th percentile) (Figure 1). At a routine evaluation when he was 6 months of age, the weight was 7.39 kg (27.1st percentile), and the length was 66.7 cm (43.1st percentile). The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and eczema. Medications included omeprazole; he was not receiving any vitamins or supplements. He had no known drug allergies, and immunizations were up to date.\nThe patient lived with his mother and father in a suburban area of New England. His father had GERD and melanoma, and cardiomyopathy had led to heart transplantation 9 years earlier. His mother was well. The patient\u2019s paternal grandmother had the Lynch syndrome and hyperparathyroidism. His maternal grandmother had diabetes and coronary artery disease, his maternal grandfather had hypertension and eczema, and his maternal uncle had the DiGeorge syndrome.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 102/78 mm Hg, the pulse 140 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute. The patient was alert and appropriately interactive. He appeared thin. The abdomen was soft, and there was no distension or tenderness. The muscle tone was normal.\nThe blood calcium level was 13.2 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]).

Emmett (Medicine): An 81-year-old man was admitted to this hospital with fever, cough, and shortness of breath during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 days before this admission, when fever and cough developed. On the morning of admission, he noted an abrupt onset of shortness of breath at rest and dyspnea on exertion. There was also substernal chest pain on the left side that worsened with deep breaths and when he lay down. The patient\u2019s son called emergency medical services, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the patient described ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath. The son reported that the patient had fallen at home 2 days before admission, but the patient did not remember falling and the son was not able to provide details about the nature or circumstances of the fall. The patient reported no pain in his abdomen, arms, legs, or groin and no headache.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension. During a previous evaluation for cough, he was reportedly told that he had a lung disease that had \u201ccaused the lung tissue to harden.\u201d Before the onset of his most recent symptoms, he had walked outside on a daily basis without limitation from shortness of breath. He took an unknown medication for hypertension. The patient did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. He lived in an apartment with his wife.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 157/95 mm Hg, the pulse 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The respiratory rate decreased to 28 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation improved to 96% with the administration of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22.8. Retractions were noted in the supraclavicular areas. Inspiratory crackles could be heard at the lung bases. The heart sounds were regular, with tachycardia but no murmur. There was no tenderness on palpation of the chest wall and no edema in the legs.

Serling-Boyd (Medicine): A 48-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of transient vision loss.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of good health until 1 hour before evaluation, when he noticed white \u201csparkles\u201d flickering in the vision of the left eye, followed by sudden blurriness. He had no floaters or eye pain. During the next 2 minutes, the blurry vision worsened and became \u201cdark,\u201d such that the patient could not see a hand in front of his face when he covered the right eye. He presented to this hospital for evaluation, arriving 1 hour after the onset of vision symptoms.\nOn presentation, the patient noted that the vision in the left eye was improving but remained blurry. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.2. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and was limited to hand motions at 0.9 m (3.0 ft) in the left eye; 2 hours later, visual acuity in the left eye was 20/40 for distance vision and 20/30 with correction for near vision. Results of the Ishihara color test were normal. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were intact; visual fields were full in response to confrontation. Intraocular pressure and results of a slit-lamp examination of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye were normal bilaterally. There was severe ptosis of the left upper eyelid (margin reflex distance, 4 mm in the right eye and 1 mm in the left eye). A dilated fundus examination revealed normal optic disks, maculae, and vessels. A nontender, irregular mass was palpable under the left superior orbital rim, but there was no proptosis. The temporal arteries were prominent bilaterally, more so on the right side than on the left side, with normal pulsations and no tenderness. There was no tenderness of the scalp or temporomandibular joints. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nA review of systems was notable for fatigue and weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past year, which the patient attributed to inactivity and decreased appetite. There was a 2-month history of bilateral jaw pain with chewing of firm foods but not with soft foods. There was lateral hip soreness in both hips after walking but no stiffness. There was a sensation of locking when flexing or extending the right first finger. Two days before evaluation, the patient had a temporal headache on the right side that resolved. He reported no numbness or weakness.\nThe patient had a history of presbyopia. He had not undergone any surgeries, was not currently taking any medications, and had no known allergies. He was born and raised in a country in Eurasia and had lived in the United States for 20 years. He traveled internationally for his work as a university professor. He was divorced and lived with his two children in a house in New England. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes for 5 years but had quit smoking 20 years earlier. He drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. His parents were alive and well, both of his grandmothers had had breast cancer, and there was no family history of ocular or autoimmune disease.\nLaboratory evaluation revealed normocytic anemia and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Results of tests of kidney and thyroid function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, creatine kinase, homocysteine, and lipoprotein(a). Testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative, and levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

The masslike lesion showed a hypointense signal on short-tau inversion recovery imaging. The brain parenchyma was normal. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck was normal, as was ultrasonography of the temporal arteries. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed markedly heterogeneous liver parenchyma and an enlarged periportal lymph node, measuring 2 cm in largest dimension. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple punctate calcifications throughout the liver and hypoattenuation of the right hepatic lobe, as well as diffuse coalescent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications. There was a prominent right hilar lymph node, measuring 10 mm in diameter. The lung parenchyma was unremarkable.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Serling-Boyd: On the second hospital day, diplopia occurred when the patient looked to the far right.

The anti-myeloperoxidase antibody titer was 221.0 U (reference value, <2.8). The patient underwent plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were administered. Hemodialysis was initiated. Two weeks later, rituximab was administered, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were discontinued. During the next 4 years, his renal function did not improve, and treatment with rituximab and hemodialysis was continued.\nFour months before the current admission, the patient underwent transplantation of a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C virus antibody\u2013positive status. After the kidney transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy included a dose of basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and tapering doses of prednisone. The patient had delayed graft function; the blood creatinine level decreased from approximately 4.00 mg per deciliter (354 mmol per liter) immediately after transplantation to 1.50 mg per deciliter (133 mmol per liter) 6 weeks later. Six days before the current admission, at a routine follow-up visit, the creatinine level was 1.33 mg per deciliter (118 mmol per liter).\nFour days before the current admission, the patient began to have central abdominal discomfort, nausea, anorexia, chills, and diarrhea with loose stools three times per day. During the next several days, he noticed decreased urine output and malaise, and he began to have rhinorrhea, cough, sinus congestion, and dyspnea. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems was notable for palpitations and dizziness and was negative for fever, emesis, and hematuria. The patient\u2019s brother had recently received a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for vasculitis with end-stage kidney disease (culminating in kidney transplantation), coronary artery disease (with placement of a stent in the right coronary artery), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cholelithiasis (with cholecystectomy), colonic polyps and diverticulosis, gout, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, hernia (with hernia repair), and spinal stenosis. Medications taken at home included mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, prednisone, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, valganciclovir, warfarin, aspirin, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, and cholecalciferol, as well as lorazepam as needed. Penicillin had caused anaphylaxis.\nThe patient was a retired business owner and lived with family in Boston. He had a remote history of tobacco smoking that totaled 10 pack-years; he had quit smoking approximately 40 years earlier. He did not drink alcohol or use other substances. His family history was notable for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease in his father and siblings. There was no known family history of kidney or autoimmune disease.\nThe temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/56 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air, 92% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 60 liters per minute. On examination, he appeared acutely ill and weak. He had bitemporal cachexia, dry oral mucosa, and increased work of breathing. Auscultation of the chest revealed tachypnea, diminished breath sounds and crackles in the lungs, and tachycardia. There was tenderness in the periumbilical area and the right lower quadrant, at the site of the kidney transplantation; the incision was well healed.\nBlood levels of lipase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine specimens were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed possible sinus tachycardia with right bundle-branch block. Vancomycin and cefepime were administered intravenously. Three hours after presentation, a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was positive, and remdesivir and dexamethasone were administered intravenously.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Initial Evaluation, Hospital Day 4, Hospital Day 14\n\nBlood\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 13.8, 10.1, 7.7\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 41.5, 29.8, 24.0\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 320, 9520, 3250\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l)\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 50, 8580, 3050\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 60, 80, 30\nMonocytes, 200\u20131200, 110, 580, 80\nEosinophils, 0\u2013900, \u2014, 0, 80\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 168,000, 106,000, 35,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 132, 134, 138\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 3.1, 4.8, 4.9\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 95, 101, 103\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 19, 18, 18\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 67, 31, 20\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 4.08, 1.63, 1.02\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 83, 170, 161\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 3.5, 1.8, 2.3\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 18, 190, 36\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201340, 61, 814, 46\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013115, 63, 134, 90\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 1.2, 2.8, 4.4\nDirect bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20130.4, 0.8, 2.2, 4.0\nLactate (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.2, 1.5, 2.4, 2.0\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 56.8, 21.2, 18.4\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 6.8, 1.9, 1.6\nPartial-thromboplastin time (sec), 22.0\u201336.0, \u2014, 76.8, 44.6\nTacrolimus (ng/ml), >2.0, 29.9, 13.1, 3.2\nHigh-sensitivity troponin T (ng/liter), 0\u20139, 105, \u2014, \u2014\nN-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (pg/ml), <900, 63,959, \u2014, \u2014\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), 0.0\u20138.0, 120.4, \u2014, \u2014\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), 20\u2013300, 4261, \u2014, \u2014\nD-dimer (ng/ml), <500, \u2014, 916, \u2014\n\nArterial blood gas\nFraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, \u2014, 0.30, 0.55\npH, 7.35\u20137.45, \u2014, 7.38, 7.31\nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 35\u201342, \u2014, 31, 40\nPartial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 80\u2013100, \u2014, 80, 65\n\nUrine\nColor, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, \u2014\nClarity, Clear, Turbid, Slightly cloudy, \u2014\npH, 5.0\u20139.0, 5.5, 6.0, \u2014\nSpecific gravity, 1.001\u20131.035, 1.019, 1.020, \u2014\nGlucose, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nKetones, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nLeukocyte esterase, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nNitrite, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nBlood, Negative, 2+, 3+, \u2014\nProtein, Negative, 2+, 2+, \u2014\nErythrocytes (per high-power field), 0\u20132, 10\u201320, 20\u201350, \u2014\nLeukocytes (per high-power field), <10, 0, 10\u201320, \u2014\nBacteria, None, 1+, 2+, \u2014\n\nDr. Joseph D. King: Radiography of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed confluent basilar consolidation in the left lung and scattered patchy opacities in the right lung. Ultrasonography that targeted the renal allograft revealed normal renal parenchyma and a trace amount of adjacent free fluid. Doppler ultrasonography (Figure 1B through 1E) showed patent vasculature with normal flow velocities but showed elevated renal arterial resistive indexes, which are suggestive of allograft dysfunction. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1F and 1G), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed confluent consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs, with more extensive findings in the left lung than in the right lung, as well as patchy multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of both lungs and the middle lobe of the right lung. Concurrent CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1H), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was remarkable for only a trace amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant, along the renal allograft.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Geadas: The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital. Phenylephrine was administered intravenously. He could not be weaned from the high-flow nasal cannula; because he had increased work of breathing and tachypnea, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation initiated. Bronchoscopy revealed dark secretions in the lower lobe and lingula of the left lung. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae in four of four bottles. A blood test for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative, and serum levels of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan and galactomannan were undetectable. Azithromycin, cefepime, linezolid, amiodarone, furosemide, and vitamin K were administered intravenously, and valganciclovir and atovaquone were administered orally. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed low-normal ventricular function, atrial enlargement, and no valvular vegetations. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated. ANCA titers were undetectable.\nOn hospital day 3, excoriation and erythema of the buttock and a purpuric plaque on the sacrum were noted (Figure 2A). Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no changes. Punch biopsy of skin on the right buttock was performed. The antibiotic regimen was transitioned to intravenous ceftriaxone.\nFIGURE 2\n\nClinical Photographs.\nThe following day, histologic examination of the skin-biopsy specimen revealed epidermal necrosis, with scattered apoptotic and necrotic keratinocytes and extravasated erythrocytes. No microorganisms were identified, and microbiologic culture of the biopsy specimen was negative. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 4 are shown in Table 1.\nDuring the next 6 days, treatment with continuous venovenous hemofiltration and intravenous ceftriaxone was continued. The level of mechanical ventilation was reduced from mandatory provided breaths to spontaneous ventilation, and the mode was switched to pressure-support ventilation. Repeat blood cultures were negative. On hospital day 11, the patient\u2019s respiratory status worsened; the fraction of inspired oxygen was increased, and a mandatory respiratory rate was reinstituted.\nTwo days later, a new well-circumscribed purpuric patch was noted on the abdomen (Figure 2B). The patch measured 5 cm in greatest dimension and had a hyperpigmented halo but had no fluctuance or crepitus. The next day, a similar-appearing lesion was noted on the right thigh. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 14 are shown in Table 1.\nDr. King: Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed increased consolidative and ground-glass opacities in both lungs.\nDr. Geadas: Ceftriaxone was discontinued, and vancomycin, cefepime, and liposomal amphotericin B were administered intravenously. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Bart K. Chwalisz: A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at a hospital affiliated with this hospital because of monocular vision loss.\nTwo months before the current presentation, during the third trimester of the patient\u2019s first pregnancy, headache and decreased vision in the right eye developed. The patient thought that the headache felt like previous migraines, which had been infrequent. However, decreased vision had not been a typical feature of her migraines. Colors appeared dim, and light perception was decreased. There was soreness in the right eye but no pain with eye movement.\nFive days later, the patient was evaluated by an optometrist. She reported that she could see only shapes and movements. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye but no response in the right eye. The patient was instructed to seek evaluation in an emergency department of another hospital.\nIn the emergency department, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, which was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material because of the pregnancy, revealed marked enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve. The nerve appeared isointense as compared with the extraocular muscles on the T1-weighted sequences but appeared bright on the T2-weighted sequence; the globes appeared normal, and the extraocular muscles were not enlarged. The results of magnetic resonance venography of the head were normal.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated for a working diagnosis of optic neuritis. During the hospitalization, her ability to see colors improved slightly, but her vision did not improve; she could see only hand motions. On the fifth hospital day, she was discharged home with instructions to schedule follow-up appointments with a neurologist and an optometrist.\nOne month after discharge from the other hospital and 2 weeks before the current presentation, the patient was again evaluated by her optometrist. The vision in the right eye had worsened; she was no longer able to see shadows or movements. The patient was referred for evaluation by a neuro-ophthalmologist.\nOn the current presentation to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic of a hospital affiliated with this hospital, the patient reported no improvement in vision and ongoing soreness in the right eye. There was a history of Lyme disease, which had been diagnosed during the second trimester of pregnancy and had been treated with amoxicillin. Medications included prenatal vitamins and ferrous sulfate. The patient lived with her husband in New England and worked in health care. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. A brother had a history of childhood epilepsy, and her mother had macular degeneration.\nOn examination, the visual acuity was 20/15 in the left eye, and there was no light perception in the right eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, although the response in the right pupil was sluggish; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the right eye. On the Ishihara color test, all plates were identified with the left eye. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye. The Ishihara color test and the visual field test could not be performed on the right eye because of poor vision. The results of a slit-lamp examination were normal, with no cells identified in the anterior chamber or vitreous. On a funduscopic examination (Figure 1A and 1B), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had temporal pallor; there was a small area of hypopigmentation close to the macula in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed increased thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer and circumferential thinning of the ganglion cell complex of the right eye; no abnormalities were noted in the left eye.\nFIGURE 1\n\nFunduscopic Images.\nThe blood creatinine level was 0.56 mg per deciliter (50 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and the blood alkaline phosphatase level 147 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). The results of other kidney-function and liver-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, the complete blood count, and the results of coagulation tests. The blood C-reactive protein level was 15 mg per liter (reference value, <8) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 34 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). A blood test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern. Tests for antibodies against aquaporin-4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) were negative. A diagnosis of atypical optic neuritis was considered. Because the patient was near delivery, further treatment was delayed until after the birth of her child, which occurred 3 days later.\nSix days after delivery of the baby, the patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional studies were obtained. Lumbar puncture was performed. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, there were no nucleated cells, and the levels of protein, glucose, albumin, and IgG were normal. There was no oligoclonal banding after concentration of the CSF. Testing of the CSF was negative for syphilis antibodies and for antibodies against aquaporin-4.\nDr. Benjamin M. Kozak: MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed prominent fusiform enlargement of a segment of the intraorbital right optic nerve with associated enhancement, as well as associated hyperintensity on the T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence. There was no evidence of associated orbital edema or other orbital abnormalities. There was a punctate hyperintense focus within the left parietal subcortical white matter on the T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, without associated enhancement or restricted diffusion.\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Chwalisz: Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone and daily plasmapheresis was administered. On the fourth hospital day, the soreness in the right eye had resolved, and there was light perception in the right eye. On the fifth hospital day, treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was changed to oral prednisone. On the ninth hospital day, rituximab was administered, and the patient was discharged home with a prescription for a 7-week tapering course of prednisone.\nDuring the next 3 weeks, treatment with rituximab was administered weekly. Two weeks after the last rituximab infusion, the patient was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at the hospital affiliated with this hospital. She reported no eye pain and only occasional headache, but she noted that the vision in the right eye had worsened. Examination revealed no light perception in the right eye, with an afferent pupillary defect. The results of a visual field test and the Ishihara color test were unchanged from the previous evaluation in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic. On a funduscopic examination (Figure 1C), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had more pronounced temporal pallor; optociliary shunt vessels were also newly present. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Kozak: Follow-up MRI of the head (Figure 2) revealed no radiologically significant change in the segmental enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve, with persistent enhancement as well as hyperintensity on the T2-weighted STIR sequence. No new orbital abnormalities were present. In addition, the punctate lesion in the left parietal subcortical white matter was unchanged.\nDr. Chwalisz: A diagnostic procedure was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Marisa L. Winkler: A 22-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of pain and rapidly spreading erythema of the left hand.\nThe patient had been well until the day of admission, when he awoke with pain and swelling of the left hand that involved the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger. Over a period of several hours, the pain progressed and bullae began to form. He began to have pain with movement of the second and fourth fingers, and the bullae turned dark purple; these changes prompted the patient to present to the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported pain of the left hand that worsened with movement of the second and fourth fingers. There was no lethargy, fatigue, headache, dyspnea, cough, or pain elsewhere. The patient had no notable medical history and had been well before the day of presentation.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There were two violaceous, tender bullae on the dorsal aspect of the left hand \u2014 one on the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and one on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger, each measuring 7 mm by 3 mm (Figure 1). In addition, there was nontender, streaking erythema spreading across the dorsal aspect of the left hand, the volar aspect of the left forearm, and the medial aspect of the left upper arm into the axilla. There was no axillary lymphadenopathy.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs.\nOn further examination of the left arm, the soft-tissue compartments were soft and compressible, without evidence of crepitus. Finger flexion and extension were intact but limited by pain and swelling in the second and fourth fingers. Results of motor and sensory examinations were normal. The hand was warm. The radial pulse was palpable, and the capillary refill was brisk. The remainder of the overall physical examination was unremarkable.

There was no evidence of osseous erosion, periosteal reaction, fracture, joint effusion, fluid collection, or subcutaneous air. The left forearm had a normal appearance on imaging.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Winkler: While the patient was in the emergency department, additional history was obtained. The patient was not taking any medications and had no known allergies to medications. He had recently graduated from college and was seeking employment. He lived with his parents in a suburban area of New England. There was no history of recent travel or sick contacts. He rarely drank alcohol and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. There was no notable family history.\nThe patient had recently begun practicing taxidermy as a new hobby. Four days before presentation, he received a frozen deer hide from a friend, which he began to prepare for tanning. When he first received the deer hide, he scraped the skin and fur to remove numerous ticks. On the day before presentation, he kneaded the hide with his hands and massaged into it a mixture of deer brain and tap water that had been prepared the day before and left to stand overnight. While the patient was working with the animal hide, he did not wear protective clothing or gloves. His mother had assisted in part of the process but remained well.\nIntravenous fluid, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.

    "user_input": "Dr. Ethan Borre (Medicine): A 36-year-old man was evaluated in the infectious diseases clinic of this hospital because of fevers.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 18 days before the current presentation, when he began to have a sensation of swelling in his throat. Three days later, the temporal temperature measured at home was 38.4\u00b0C. A home test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen was negative. The patient was evaluated in a local urgent care clinic, where he was told that there were white spots on his tonsils. Treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid was started for a presumptive diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. A throat culture was reportedly negative, but treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid was continued. During the next 4 days, fevers persisted. A repeat home test for SARS-CoV-2 antigen was negative. Eleven days before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician.\nIn addition to fevers, the patient reported headaches. Two weeks before the onset of symptoms, he had traveled with his wife to the southwestern United States for 1 week. During the trip, his wife had begun to have fever and sore throat; her symptoms had resolved after several days, and she did not seek medical evaluation. The patient reported that he did not have throat pain, but rather that the lower part of his neck felt swollen and that moving his neck caused discomfort. He had no dysphagia, odynophagia, rhinorrhea, or rash. His medical history included seasonal allergies.\nTwo years earlier, a routine screening test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had been negative. In addition to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid, medications included ibuprofen as needed for headaches and acetaminophen as needed for fevers. The patient had no known drug allergies. He lived in Massachusetts and worked in an office setting. He had moved to the United States from Asia 7 years before the current presentation. He drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. He occasionally smoked tobacco. His father had hypertension, and his paternal grandmother had cancer of unclear primary origin.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 127/69 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The tonsils appeared normal, without exudates or enlargement. There was mild tenderness on palpation over the anterior portion of the neck that was thought to correspond to enlarged lymph nodes in the anterior cervical region. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nA complete blood count with differential count and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was 65.8 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) antibodies was negative. Urinalysis was normal. A specimen of blood was obtained for culture. The results of chest radiography were normal. A diagnosis of viral pharyngitis was considered, but treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid for possible streptococcal pharyngitis was continued.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range, 11 Days before the Current Presentation\n\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 43.8\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 14.6\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 7320\n\nDifferential count (per pl):\nNeutrophils (per \u00b5l), 1800\u20137700, 5100\nLymphocytes (per \u00b5l), 1000\u20134800, 1430\nMonocytes (per \u00b5l), 200\u20131200, 610\nEosinophils (per \u00b5l), 0\u2013900, 130\nBasophils (per \u00b5l), 0\u2013300, 30\nImmature granulocytes (per \u00b5l), 0\u2013100, 20\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 375,000\n\nDuring the next 6 days, daily fevers and headaches continued, and fatigue developed. The patient reported his symptoms during a telephone call with his primary care physician. Blood cultures that had been obtained during the previous evaluation were without growth, and additional testing was performed. The blood level of CRP was 138.9 mg per liter, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 81 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 14). A test for Lyme disease was nonreactive. The result of an interferon-\u03b3 release assay to detect previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis was invalid because of a test control failure. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Shambo Guha Roy: Computed tomography (CT) of the neck (Figure 1), chest, and abdomen was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. A calcified lung nodule that was observed in the left lower lobe was consistent with previous granulomatous disease, and mild degenerative changes were noted in the thoracic spine. Evaluation of the thyroid gland was suboptimal owing to a streak artifact from the arms; however, a possible hypoattenuating nodule was observed in the right lobe.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Neck.\nDr. Borre: During the next 4 days, fevers continued, and the patient was referred to the infectious diseases clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the infectious diseases clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient reported that fevers were most prominent in the evening; the highest recorded temperature was 39.5\u00b0C. He had had two episodes of chills associated with fever, as well as occasional night sweats. He had no pets or animal exposures. He did not consume unpasteurized cheeses or uncooked meats. He was sexually active with his wife. A dental extraction had been performed 2 months before the onset of fevers. He had no known exposures to persons with tuberculosis.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 144/98 mm Hg, the pulse 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was noted to cough occasionally during the examination but was breathing comfortably with normal lung sounds. The oropharynx appeared normal, without tonsillar exudates. There was no supraclavicular, submandibular, cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Firm, nontender thyroid tissue was palpable in the anterior portion of the neck. No rashes or skin lesions were present, including on the palms or soles. The heart was tachycardic with a regular rhythm and no murmurs. There was no hepatosplenomegaly.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Sunu S. Thomas: A 26-year-old pregnant woman was transferred to this hospital for evaluation and treatment of cardiogenic shock after a cardiac arrest resulting from ventricular tachycardia.\nThe patient had had two previous uncomplicated pregnancies and was currently pregnant at 32 weeks of gestation with monochorionic, diamniotic twins. Her pregnancy had been monitored for polyhydramnios by her obstetrician with the use of serial fetal ultrasonography.\nThree weeks before presentation to this hospital, one of the patient\u2019s preschool-age children had an ear infection and the other had a sore throat. The patient had erythema in the eyes with greenish drainage, for which topical erythromycin and sulfacetamide were prescribed. One week later, a nonproductive cough complicated by a sore throat and ear pain developed. The patient also noted new edema in her legs that was not associated with pain, redness, or warmth. However, during the subsequent week, progressive pain in her right leg occurred, which prompted her to seek care at an emergency department of another hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the pulse 113 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Pitting edema of the legs was noted, with no associated erythema, warmth, or tenderness on palpation of the calves. Ultrasonography of the right leg reportedly showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and a rapid test for streptococcal antigen was negative. While the patient was in the emergency department, painful uterine contractions with back discomfort developed; the cervix was 2 cm dilated. She was admitted to the labor and delivery unit for management of preterm labor. Intramuscular betamethasone and magnesium sulfate were administered for maturation of the fetal lungs and tocolysis, respectively. Continuous intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution was initiated. Subcutaneous heparin was not administered, because delivery was thought to be imminent. After 24 hours of magnesium sulfate therapy, the uterine contractions remained unchanged, and no further cervical dilatation was noted. Because of concern about preterm labor, she remained hospitalized, with continuous monitoring of the fetal heart rate.\nFive days after admission to the labor and delivery unit, the patient had tenderness in the left leg, and the edema in both legs had worsened. She also had episodes of severe coughing but reported no chest pain or shortness of breath. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/51 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed expiratory wheezes. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Doppler ultrasound examination of the legs revealed an occlusive thrombus in the left peroneal vein. The hematology service was consulted, and an intravenous heparin infusion was initiated. Intravenous furosemide and oral azithromycin and guaifenesin were also administered.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (First Hospital), 1 Day before Transfer (First Hospital), Day of Transfer after Cardiac Arrest (First Hospital), Reference Range (This Hospital), On Arrival (This Hospital)\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 11.2\u201315.7, 10.9, 11.0, 12.0\u201316.0, 9.6\nHematocrit (%), 34.1\u201344.9, 32.5, 33.1, 36.0\u201346.0, 28.2\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 132,000, 190,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 158\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 3980\u201310,040, 8920, 12,670, 4500\u201311,000, 19,500\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l),\n\u2003Neutrophils, 1400\u20137700, 6333, 5448, 1800\u20137700, 16,302\n\u2003Lymphocytes, 1100\u20134000, 892, 3928, 1000\u20134800, 1014\n\u2003Eosinophils, 0\u2013700, 89, 127, 0\u2013900, 0\n\u2003Bands, 0\u20134, 714, 1140, 0\u20131100, 838\nSodium (mmol/liter), 136\u2013145, 135, 142, 135\u2013145, 143\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.5\u20135.1, 3.6, 3.8, 3.4\u20135.0, 4.0\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013107, 102, 108, 98\u2013108, 109\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 21\u201332, 20, 19, 23\u201332, 21\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 7\u201318, 9, 8, 8\u201325, 9\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.55\u20131.02, 0.57, 1.0, 0.60\u20131.50, 0.67\nGlucose (mg/dl), 74\u2013100, 98, 152, 70\u2013110, 202\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.1, 7.9, 7.5, 8.5\u201310.5, 6.7\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.4\u20138.2, 4.9, 5.0, 6.0\u20138.3, 3.6\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.4\u20135.0, 1.9, 1.6, 3.3\u20135.0, 1.9\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 5\u201337, 26, 44, 9\u201332, 648\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201365, 25, 31, 7\u201333, 101\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013117, 142, 141, 30\u2013100, 132\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.2\u20131.0, 0.59, 0.28, 0.0\u20131.0, 0.8\nMagnesium (mg/dl), 1.6\u20132.6, \u2014, 2.0, 1.7\u20132.4, 1.8\nProthrombin time (sec), 9.5\u201312.1, \u2014, 10.1, 11.5\u201314.5, 15.0\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.91\u20131.16, \u2014, 0.97, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.2\nPartial-thromboplastin time (sec), 23.9\u201331.3, \u2014, 73.8, 22.0\u201335.0, >150.0\nCentral venous oxygen saturation (%), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 70\u201380, 76.9\nPhosphorus (mg/dl), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 2.6\u20134.5, 4.1\nIonized calcium (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.14\u20131.30, 0.96\nGlobulin (g/dl), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.9\u20134.1, 1.3\nLactic acid (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.5\u20132.2, 1.3\nTroponin T (ng/ml), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, <0.03, 28.32\nCreatine kinase (U/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 40\u2013150, 11,012\nCreatine kinase MB isoenzyme (U/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.0\u20136.9, 552.0\nFibrinogen (mg/dl), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 150\u2013400, 259\nArterial blood gases:\n\u2003Fraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.0, \u2014, 1.0\n\u2003pH, 7.35\u20137.45, \u2014, 7.19, 7.35\u20137.45, 7.31\n\u2003Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 35\u201345, \u2014, 42.7, 35\u201342, 42\n\u2003Partial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 75\u2013100, \u2014, 251.9, 80\u2013100, 449\n\n\nThe next morning, after the patient had eaten breakfast, she had sudden severe, \u201ccrushing\u201d chest pain and became unresponsive and pulseless. Telemetry revealed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 178 beats per minute, with a right bundle-branch block pattern with a superior axis. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and after the administration of epinephrine and cardioversion, the return of spontaneous circulation was achieved within 4 minutes. Intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, propofol, and fentanyl were administered. The trachea was intubated, and ventilatory support was initiated. An emergency cesarean section was performed, and two healthy male infants were delivered, with an estimated intraoperative blood loss of 1600 ml. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Andrew S. Fox: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening, findings that were consistent with pulmonary edema; bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion; cardiomegaly with biventricular enlargement; and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery, which measured 3.8 cm in diameter. No pulmonary embolus was identified.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Chest.\nDr. Thomas: A transthoracic echocardiogram showed biventricular dilatation and severely decreased biventricular systolic function, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion. Furosemide was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to a nearby tertiary care center for further treatment.\nOn arrival at the second hospital, 210 minutes after the cardiac arrest, the pulse was 177 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure was 65 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. Physical examination was notable for diffusely coarse breath sounds, rapid regular heart sounds, and generalized edema. Thirty minutes after arrival at the second hospital, the patient underwent cannulation for femoral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and an intravenous infusion of milrinone was initiated. Ventricular tachycardia recurred; intravenous magnesium and lidocaine were administered, and the arrhythmia was terminated with cardioversion. Plans were made to transfer the patient by helicopter to this hospital, and intravenous vecuronium was given in preparation for transport. During the flight, severe vaginal bleeding developed, and 2 units of packed red cells were transfused; however, the heparin infusion was continued, given the presence of the ECMO circuit.\nOn arrival at this hospital, 10 hours after the cardiac arrest, additional information was obtained from the patient\u2019s sister and grandmother. The patient had a history of childhood asthma, obesity, anxiety, and depression. She had previously delivered two healthy, full-term children; her current pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus and polyhydramnios of one of the fetuses. Her medication history included insulin, inhaled albuterol, sertraline, iron sulfate, and folic acid. She had had no known adverse drug reactions. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was married and had two healthy preschool-age children, in addition to her two newborns. Her mother had died from ovarian cancer; her sister was healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the pulse 123 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure 76 mm Hg without intrinsic arterial pulsatility while the patient was receiving ECMO support. The respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was receiving oxygen through volume assist\u2013control mechanical ventilation, with a delivered tidal volume of 290 ml and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0. The weight was 105 kg, the height 163 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 39.5. The central venous pressure was 4 mm Hg. The pupils were equal and briskly reactive to light; once the patient was weaned off propofol, she was able to follow commands and move her arms and legs. Breath sounds were coarse bilaterally and diminished at the bases. Heart sounds were distant. The abdomen was soft and obese; no active bleeding was noted from the surgical incision, but large-volume vaginal bleeding and clots were observed. The arms and legs were warm and had moderate symmetric pitting edema. The femoral venous and arterial cannulas were secured in place in the right groin. The blood level of thyrotropin was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for influenza viruses, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus were negative.\nDr. Fox: Chest radiography (Figure 1C), performed at the time of transfer to this hospital, revealed interstitial opacities, a small left pleural effusion, and a dense retrocardiac opacity on the left side. The venous ECMO drainage cannula and a central venous catheter were visible in the right atrium.\nDr. Thomas: An electrocardiogram (Figure 2A) showed normal sinus rhythm, right bundle-branch block, borderline-low QRS voltage, and Q waves with T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads.\nFIGURE 2\n\nCardiac Studies.\nDr. Doreen DeFaria Yeh: Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 2B; and Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org), performed while the patient was receiving ECMO support, revealed a dilated left ventricular cavity with normal wall thickness and severe diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis that was most prominent in the anterior, anteroseptal, and lateral territories, with an estimated ejection fraction of 11%. Additional notable findings included moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, moderate right ventricular dysfunction and dilatation, an estimated pulmonary-artery systolic pressure of 53 mm Hg, a small pericardial effusion, and a pleural effusion. The ECMO inflow cannula was visualized in the inferior vena cava, and consistent with systemic ECMO blood flows, the aortic valve was observed not to open during the cardiac cycle, which suggested very poor native left ventricular contraction. There was no evidence of intracardiac shunting.\nDr. Thomas: The dose of milrinone was increased, and the dopamine infusion was discontinued. An oxytocin infusion and rectal misoprostol were administered. Ongoing large-volume vaginal bleeding was observed, and an intrauterine balloon was placed to control the bleeding.\nA diagnosis and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Jeffrey M. Sumner (Pediatrics): An 8-week-old male infant was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital because of inconsolable crying, lethargy, weakness, and hypoxemia.\nThe patient had been well until 7 days before the current presentation, when irritability and frequent crying developed. One day before the current presentation, the episodes of crying increased in duration, and the patient\u2019s grandmother noticed that he cried more intensely when the right side of his abdomen was touched. The patient was evaluated at the pediatric primary care clinic of another hospital. The vital signs and physical examination were reportedly normal, and a diagnosis of discomfort due to gastrointestinal gas was considered.\nAfter the patient returned home, he had a crying episode that lasted for multiple hours while he was awake; the crying stopped while he was fully asleep. After he woke up, the crying continued for 8 hours and became weaker. During breast-feeding, the patient fed less vigorously than usual, and the latch onto the nipple was weaker. That night, the crying continued, and the patient became inconsolable. He had frantic movements of the arms and legs and slept only 1 hour. On the day of the current presentation, the inconsolable crying continued. The patient did not latch onto the nipple, and his mother expressed breast milk directly into his mouth. A family member called the pediatric primary care clinic and was instructed to bring the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family members. There had been no change in the frequency of wet diapers; the last bowel movement had occurred 2 days before this presentation. The patient had been born at a gestational age of 39 weeks 1 day by a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery after a normal pregnancy. The birth weight had been 4.5 kg (98th percentile), the length 54.6 cm (99th percentile), and the head circumference 36.5 cm (94th percentile). The patient had met normal developmental milestones. He had not yet received the routine immunizations recommended for 2-month-old infants. Medications included vitamin D supplements; there were no known medication allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with his grandmother, who primarily cared for him, as well as his mother, father, and sister. His mother had depression, anxiety, and anemia. His father and sister were healthy.\nOn examination, the axillary temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/76 mm Hg, the heart rate 153 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 7.1 kg (99th percentile), the height 62.5 cm (>99th percentile), and the head circumference 41.5 cm (99th percentile). The patient was alert but irritable. He cried weakly and could not be soothed. The anterior fontanelle was open, soft, and flat. The mucous membranes were moist. The heart rate was tachycardic and regular. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft, with no hepatosplenomegaly. The results of the testicular examination were normal. There was no rash.\nThe blood levels of glucose, lactic acid, lipase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 621,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000); the remainder of the complete blood count and differential count was normal. The results of urinalysis and urine toxicology screening were normal. Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza A and B viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for culture. Radiography of the chest and abdomen and ultrasonography of the abdomen showed no abnormalities.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range, On Admission\n\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 5000\u201319,500, 5480\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 10.0\u201318.0, 12.8\nHematocrit (%), 31.0\u201355.0, 37.5\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 621,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 136\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 5.4\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013106, 102\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 22\u201327, 18\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 5\u201320, 8\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.30\u20131.00, 0.27\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 108\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 10.8\nLactic acid (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.0, 1.8\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201380, 43\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 26\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 122\u2013469, 658\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), <1.2, 3.1\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 4.8\nGlobulin (g/dl), 1.9\u20134.1, 1.8\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.0\u20138.3, 6.6\n\nWhile the patient was in the emergency department, he remained irritable and did not attain a calm awake state. He was admitted to this hospital. Four hours after presentation, lethargy developed. Additional testing was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture was performed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The CSF glucose level was 54 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and the CSF protein level was 104 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55); there were 1055 red cells per microliter and 2 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 70% were lymphocytes. A diagnosis of meningitis was considered. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir was started.\nSix hours after presentation, increased work of breathing developed, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 100%. The patient was transferred to the PICU.\nDr. Sarah A. Murphy: On arrival at the PICU, the patient was difficult to arouse. He had grunting respirations, head-bobbing, intercostal retractions, and an exaggerated abdominal breathing pattern. With vigorous stimulation, the patient had a weak hypophonic cry, gurgling, and stertor on inspiration. Ptosis was present in both eyes. When the eyes were opened by the examiner, the pupils were equal, round, and reactive. The face appeared symmetric and placid. There were few spontaneous movements of the arms, and the patient did not move his arms against gravity. There was no spontaneous movement of the legs, and diffuse hypotonia was present. Muscle bulk was normal and symmetric. Reflexes were decreased but preserved.\nTracheal intubation was performed, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Tachycardia and hypertension persisted despite the administration of boluses of sedative and analgesic agents and the initiation of continuous infusions of opioids and benzodiazepines.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Joshua U. Okonkwo (Neurology): An 80-year-old man was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of left foot drop.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 5 years before the current presentation, when he first noticed that he needed to lift up his left leg while walking in order to prevent the toes of his left foot from dragging on the ground. During the next 2 years, his ability to dorsiflex the left ankle decreased progressively. Three years before this presentation, he began to use an ankle\u2013foot orthosis.\nOne year before this presentation, the patient was evaluated in a neurology clinic affiliated with another hospital. He reported left foot drop, as well as occasional falls that he attributed to poor balance. Examination reportedly revealed wasting in the muscles below the left knee, weakness with attempts at dorsiflexion and eversion of the left ankle, loss of pinprick sensation to the midshins in both legs, and decreased vibratory sensation in the toes of both feet. The blood levels of cobalamin, folate, thyrotropin, and glycated hemoglobin and the results of serum protein electrophoresis were reportedly normal. Tests for syphilis and antinuclear antibodies were negative, as were blood tests for antibodies to sulfate-3-glucuronyl paragloboside and myelin-associated glycoprotein and a serum paraneoplastic autoantibody panel. The blood creatine kinase level was 456 IU per liter (reference range, 30 to 194) and the aldolase level 5.8 U per liter (reference value, <8.1). Imaging studies were obtained.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was reportedly normal. MRI of the lumbar spine reportedly revealed diffuse disk bulging with facet hypertrophy at multiple levels, which was contributing to mild spinal stenosis. Needle electromyography (EMG) of the left leg reportedly showed changes consistent with moderate-to-severe, subacute-to-chronic radiculopathy at L5 and S1 on the left side.\nThe patient declined further workup at that time. One year later, his symptoms had not resolved, and he presented to the neurology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn the current evaluation, the patient reported stable left foot drop and mild low-back pain without radiating symptoms. He had no bowel or bladder changes, no double vision or hearing changes, and no difficulty with breathing, chewing, or swallowing. His medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, and adenocarcinoma of the prostate, which had been treated with local radiation therapy 4 years before this presentation. Medications included aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, metoprolol, and simvastatin. The patient was married, resided in New England, and was retired from work in the insurance industry. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit smoking 30 years before this presentation. He drank four alcoholic drinks per day. His sister had breast cancer, and his father had died in his 70s from esophageal cancer.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 140/60 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.1. He had a steppage gait pattern with prominent left foot drop. He could not walk on his left heel, but he was able to walk on his left toes and to walk with a tandem gait.\nThere was mild facial weakness, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side, with an asymmetric smile and weak eye closure and cheek puffing. The optic disks had sharp margins. The pupils were round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were full. There was no weakness or atrophy of the jaw, palate, or tongue. Hearing was grossly intact. Shoulder shrug was asymmetric, with less rise on the right side. A motor examination revealed wasting of the shoulder girdle, which was more prominent on the right side, and wasting of the calves. Tone was mildly decreased throughout, and there were no fasciculations. There was severe scapular winging, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side. There was no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia.\nStrength was assessed according to the Medical Research Council scale, which ranges from 0 (no visible muscle contraction) to 5 (normal strength). On the right and left sides, strength was 4 and 4+, respectively, on shoulder abduction; 5 and 3 on ankle dorsiflexion; 4+ and 4 on big-toe extension; 5 and 4+ on ankle inversion; and 5 and 4\u2212 on ankle eversion. On both sides, strength was 4+ on hip flexion and was normal on neck flexion and extension, elbow flexion and extension, wrist flexion and extension, finger extension and abduction, thumb abduction, hip abduction, knee flexion and extension, and plantar flexion. Deep-tendon reflexes were 1+ at the biceps, 1+ at the triceps, trace at the brachioradialis, 2+ at the knees, and not elicited at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor. There was loss of pinprick and temperature sensations to the midshins in both legs, as well as decreased vibratory sensation to the ankles. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Karen A. Buch: MRI of the lumbar spine (Figure 1) revealed a large, leftward, eccentric disk herniation at L5 and S1 that impinged on the exiting L5 nerve roots, with greater impingement on the left side than on the right side. There was narrowing of the left subarticular zone and left lateral recess that encroached on the descending left S1 nerve root. Facet hypertrophy and ligamentous infolding at multiple levels were contributing to mild central spinal stenosis.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Lumbar Spine.\nDr. Okonkwo: Additional testing was performed, and a diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Diana L. Stern (Psychiatry): A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of depression, recurrent falls, and difficulty caring for herself.\nFour years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of depression that was precipitated by psychosocial stressors. She was treated with bupropion, citalopram, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The depression was well controlled until 1 year before the current admission, when she began to have anhedonia, decreased energy, sadness, and poor concentration. She resumed cognitive behavioral therapy, but her symptoms worsened during the next 4 months, and she had suicidal ideation. The dose of bupropion was increased, and treatment with trazodone was started.\nFourteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident that was attributed to her falling asleep while driving. After the accident, she reported increased sadness, low energy, and inability to perform her usual activities. One week later, she fell and struck her head, and she was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that, before her fall, she had been feeling unsteady because of weakness in the left leg. A physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hypodensities involving the subcortical and periventricular white matter, findings consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital and was discharged home.\nDuring the next week, the patient had balance difficulties and began using a walker. When she was evaluated in the neurology clinic, she reported imbalance and occasional nausea. On examination, she had a depressed affect. Strength was assessed as 5\u2212/5 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, and patellar tendons and were absent at the ankles, with downgoing toes. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with mild dragging of the left leg. A diagnosis of postconcussive syndrome was considered, and treatment with ondansetron was started for nausea. Additional tests were performed.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased signal intensity in the pons and in a periventricular distribution on T2-weighted imaging, without associated contrast enhancement. There was a region of decreased signal intensity in the right corona radiata on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Results of electroencephalography were normal, as were results of electromyography and nerve-conduction studies of the left leg. Physical therapy was recommended, and repeat MRI was planned for 6 weeks later.\nOver the next 6-week period, during sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, the patient was noted to be less talkative, with slow processing, impaired recall, and mild inattention. Repeat MRI with angiography performed 6 weeks after the first study revealed patchy hyperintensity involving the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, and corticospinal tract bilaterally on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, without contrast enhancement; the cerebral vasculature was normal.\nThe patient had recurrent falls without loss of consciousness and began using a wheelchair. She reported worsening sadness, anxiety, and anhedonia, and treatment with buspirone was started. On evaluation in the neurology clinic 6 weeks before the current admission, testing of leg strength yielded inconsistent results, but strength in both legs was assessed as 5\u2212/5 with maximum effort. Dragging of the left leg was also noted to be inconsistent. There were concerns that her depression might be contributing to her neurologic changes, and further follow-up with the psychiatric service was recommended.\nFive weeks before the current admission, the patient\u2019s husband brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for an evaluation of worsening memory impairment, poor self-care, and frequent falls. The patient had stopped participating in physical therapy and was spending most of the day in bed. She reported that she had lost 14 kg during the previous 4 months. Other medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and osteoarthritis of the knees. There was a history of postpartum depression 27 years earlier that had lasted for several months. Medications included amlodipine, buspirone, bupropion, cholecalciferol, citalopram, metformin, and trazodone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband in a suburb of Boston and worked as a teacher. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol only occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of anxiety and depression in her seventh decade of life. Her sister had a history of stroke.\nOn examination, the patient appeared tired and disheveled, with psychomotor retardation. Strength in both legs was assessed as 5/5. She had a monoplegic gait, with buckling of the left leg, when walking down a hallway, but she had a normal gait when walking on a treadmill. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 25, indicating mild cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The complete blood count, results of liver-function and kidney-function tests, and blood levels of cobalamin, thyrotropin, and electrolytes were normal. Screening for syphilis, Lyme disease, and the human immunodeficiency virus was negative, as was urine toxicologic screening. After an evaluation by a neurology consultant, the patient was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit.\nWhile the patient was in the hospital, the dose of citalopram was tapered, and treatment with desvenlafaxine and amphetamine\u2013dextroamphetamine was started; her levels of attention and wakefulness increased. She participated in group psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational and physical therapy. She continued to have variable weakness in the left leg and had three witnessed falls, during which she reportedly had fatigue and lowered herself to the ground.\nOn hospital day 11, the patient reported being unable to use her left arm because of weakness. Although her left arm rested across her chest for most of the day, she was observed holding her husband\u2019s hand with her left hand when saying goodbye. On evaluation by a neurology consultant, strength in the left arm was assessed as 5/5. The working diagnosis was functional neurologic disorder. On hospital day 12, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center.\nAt the rehabilitation center, the patient received physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medications to treat depression. During the first week, she made progress toward independence in bathing, toileting, and grooming but had limited attention, memory, and problem solving. During the second week, she became more withdrawn. There was a paucity of speech with hypophonia, decreased attention, and less eye contact with visitors who sat on her left side than with visitors who sat on her right side. During the third week, the patient stopped answering questions and following commands. She was evaluated again in the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/90 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was withdrawn and minimally interactive. She was able to state her name but not the date or location. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side and did not track the examiner\u2019s finger past the midline to the left. There was flattening of the left nasolabial fold. The left arm was hypertonic and held in flexion; there was no spontaneous movement of the left arm or leg, and she declined to participate in a strength examination. She did not withdraw the left arm in response to nail-bed pressure; she withdrew the left foot with antigravity movement in response to tactile stimulation.\nThe white-cell count was 12,940 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with a normal differential count. The remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Jessica L. Logeman (Medicine): A 55-year-old man was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of a mediastinal mass that was identified as part of an evaluation for waxing and waning fevers, night sweats, and fatigue.\nThe patient had been well until 3 months before admission to this hospital, when fatigue and a transient pruritic maculopapular rash on the forearm developed. During the next 6 weeks, the forearm rash resolved but fatigue persisted. The patient began to take naps during the daytime and was unable to put in full days at his job in construction work. He also began to have night sweats and fevers with temperatures of up to 37.8\u00b0C.\nTwenty-seven days before admission to this hospital, the patient found that he was unable to work because of fatigue, and he sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Blood tests for anaplasma and babesia nucleic acids were negative, but screening and confirmatory tests for Lyme disease IgM and IgG were positive. A diagnosis of Lyme disease was made, and treatment with doxycycline was initiated. Because gastrointestinal upset developed, doxycycline was discontinued and amoxicillin was prescribed for the remainder of the 14-day course.\nSixteen days before admission to this hospital, the patient began to have chest discomfort, which he described as a sensation of a \u201csoftball\u201d in his left lower chest. The chest discomfort limited his ability to breathe, and his primary care physician referred him to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, he reported increasing fatigue and malaise, night sweats, and fevers, along with diffuse arthralgias and myalgias, headache, photophobia with some visual flashes, dyspnea on exertion, edema, a pruritic erythematous rash on his chest, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and distention, and watery diarrhea that occurred three times per day.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 145/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 61 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.1. There was a faint diffuse erythematous macular rash on the anterior portion of the chest. The abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and lipase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram was normal. Intravenous normal saline and oral acetaminophen were administered, as was empirical treatment with intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, hydromorphone, and ondansetron.

Goiffon: Fifteen days before admission to this hospital, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a bilobed heterogeneous soft-tissue mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 2.8 cm, in the anterior mediastinum. There were multiple enlarged subcarinal and mediastinal lymph nodes (measuring up to 15 mm in short-axis diameter), multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (measuring up to 11 mm in short-axis diameter), mesenteric fat stranding, and trace ascites.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Logeman: Abdominal discomfort persisted; piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was discontinued and ceftriaxone was prescribed. Two days later, CT of the abdomen, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new pulmonary edema, new small bilateral pleural effusions, and an increased volume of ascites. The patient was transferred to a second hospital for further evaluation.\nPhysical examination was notable for mild abdominal tenderness and distention, as well as leg edema. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin and a urinalysis were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) (Figure 1D) revealed indeterminate low-level FDG uptake in the anterior mediastinal soft tissue, as well as in pleural effusions and mediastinal lymph nodes.\nDuring the next week, dyspnea and abdominal pain persisted. Edema increased, specifically in the abdomen, legs, and face; the weight increased to 93.0 kg. Intravenous ceftriaxone and metoclopramide and oral hydromorphone, ondansetron, and lactulose were administered. Additional laboratory tests were performed (Table 2).\nTABLE 2\n\nAdditional Laboratory Data.\nOn the eighth day at the second hospital, video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed. The mediastinum reportedly appeared inflamed. The patient underwent an evacuation of pleural fluid and a biopsy of mediastinal soft tissue and lymph nodes primarily in the subcarinal window (level VII). On pathological examination of the biopsy specimens, the mediastinal soft tissue showed fibroconnective and adipose tissue with fibrosis, mild inflammation and fat necrosis, prominent capillary proliferation, and congestion; the lymph nodes were reportedly \u201cmildly abnormal.\u201d Microbiologic evaluation of the biopsy specimens revealed occasional leukocytes but no acid-fast bacilli or fungal elements. On flow cytometry of the biopsy specimens, the mediastinal soft tissue did not show any abnormal cell populations; the lymph nodes contained polyclonal B-cell and heterogeneous T-cell populations, without immunophenotypic evidence of lymphoma. Bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures of the biopsy specimens were negative. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid revealed reactive mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes but no malignant cells.\nAfter the procedure, the creatinine level increased to 2.93 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.50 to 1.30). Examination of urinary sediment revealed hyaline and granular casts. Intravenous furosemide was administered. On the 15th day at the second hospital, the patient was transferred to this hospital.\nOn arrival, the patient reported persistent fatigue, mild dyspnea, abdominal distention, edema, and anorexia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and the chest rash had resolved. Fevers and night sweats had occurred in a waxing and waning pattern during the previous weeks. He reported intermittent photophobia and headache, without neck stiffness or phonophobia, and had no other neurologic symptoms.\nThe patient had no history of illness and had not received routine medical care as an adult. He took ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed and had no known allergies to medications. He had been exposed to dust through his job in construction work. He lived with his wife, child, and pet dog and cat in a coastal wooded community in New England. He frequently spent time outdoors, either working or playing golf, and had received multiple tick bites. He had traveled to the Mediterranean and Oceania regions in previous years and, more recently, to the southwestern United States. The patient had never used tobacco or illicit drugs and drank beer rarely. His father had had prostate cancer and colon cancer.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 148/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 91.7 kg. Neurologic examination was normal, and there was no nuchal rigidity. There were inspiratory crackles in the left lung. The abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Mild fluctuance was noted on the right side of the chest, at the site of the surgical incision. There was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, submandibular, submental, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There was 2+ pitting edema in the legs.\nBlood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, folate, globulin, haptoglobin, and vitamin B12 were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed cloudy yellow urine with 2+ protein and 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2). An electrocardiogram was normal.\nDr. Goiffon: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1E), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an anterior mediastinal mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 1.9 cm, which was slightly smaller than it had been on the previous chest CT. There were enlarged perivascular, paratracheal, subcarinal, and aortopulmonary mediastinal lymph nodes (measuring up to 12 mm in short-axis diameter) with heterogeneous enhancement. Increased pulmonary edema, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, moderate-volume ascites, mild splenomegaly, and multiple subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes were detected.\nDr. Logeman: On the third hospital day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed no abnormalities. On the fourth day, a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Intravenous furosemide and oral acetaminophen were administered. Lumbar puncture was performed, and 26 ml of colorless fluid was removed; opening pressure was not measured. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. On the fifth day, renal ultrasonography revealed kidneys of normal size with normal parenchyma and no hydronephrosis. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed; results of ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table S1.\nDr. Goiffon: On the 13th day, MRI of the chest was started but could not be completed because the patient had respiratory distress when placed in the prone position. Sequences that were obtained before termination of the study (Figure 1F) showed an anterior mediastinal soft-tissue mass with hypointensity on steady-state gradient echo imaging; the mass was smaller than it had been on chest CT performed before transfer to this hospital. In addition, there were enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, large bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and a hematoma at the site of the surgical incision.\nDr. Logeman: Additional laboratory tests were performed (Table 2).

Bilateral, frontal, pulsatile headache developed suddenly and reached maximal intensity within seconds. The patient rated the pain at 10 (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain) and noted that it was the worst headache pain that she had ever had. The pain was so severe that she could not complete her sentence. She sat down, feeling as though she might faint because of the severity of the pain. She repeatedly told her husband, \u201cSomething is really wrong.\u201d Nausea developed without emesis. When the symptoms did not abate after 30 minutes, emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing headache and nausea. Medical history included hypertension and cervical disk disease with chronic neck pain. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide and oral conjugated estrogens, which the patient took every 3 days for symptoms of menopause. She had no known allergies. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. She lived with her husband and worked as an administrative assistant. Her mother had diabetes. There was no family history of venous thromboembolism.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 157/77 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The neck was supple. She was oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. The visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The visualized portions of the retina were normal in both eyes with normal-appearing optic disks. Tests of motor strength and sensation showed normal results, as did tests of reflexes and cerebellar function. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count with differential count and the results of tests of kidney function and coagulation. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Javier M. Romero: Two hours after the onset of headache, computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1), revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left superior parietal lobule and paramedian parietal sulci.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT Scan of the Head, Obtained during the Initial Presentation.\nDr. DiCarlo: Treatment with intravenous morphine and promethazine was administered. Nausea resolved, and the headache pain abated. Four hours after the onset of headache, the blood pressure was 136/45 mm Hg. Additional laboratory studies were obtained. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 8 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), the blood level of C-reactive protein 2.7 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the blood level of troponin T 0.36 ng per milliliter (reference value, <0.03). Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block and diffuse submillimeter ST-segment depressions.\nAdditional testing was performed, and a diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Rachel M. Erdil (Medicine): A 58-year-old woman was evaluated in the infectious disease clinic of this hospital because of fatigue, abdominal bloating, and eosinophilia.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 8 months before the current evaluation, when she fell and injured her right leg while hiking in a rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Before this injury, she had been traveling throughout the DRC for 1 month. She had hiked, walked barefoot, and gone swimming in freshwater lakes and rivers.\nApproximately 55 hours after the fall, the patient was transported to the trauma center of a regional hospital. Imaging studies revealed fractures of the right tibia with associated hemorrhage. Packed red cells were transfused, and an external fixation device was placed. Once the patient\u2019s condition was stable, she was transferred to a hospital in the United States.\nAt the second hospital, the eosinophil count was 3530 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 400); the eosinophil count had been normal 18 months earlier. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. One week after the fall, open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture was performed.

She had associated these symptoms with the onset of menopause. However, after the traumatic leg injury, she noticed that the symptoms increased in severity. One month before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s weight had increased by 8.6 kg since the leg injury, and she took a 1-hour nap every afternoon because of fatigue. In addition, she had new abdominal bloating that did not abate with the use of probiotics. The patient sought evaluation at a clinic associated with the second hospital. On evaluation, the results of blood tests for thyroid, kidney, and liver function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes. A test for Lyme disease was negative. The results of testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)\u2013specific antibodies and other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nTwo weeks before the current evaluation, the patient moved to New England and established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. She continued to receive physical therapy for rehabilitation of the right leg. She reported that the weight gain, fatigue, and abdominal bloating had worsened at a rapid rate; her weight had increased by 13.6 kg since the leg injury. The patient was referred to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital.\nThe patient had a history of chronic migraines and hyperlipidemia. Review of systems was notable for mild cough and swelling of the right knee that began after the surgery. She had no fever, hot flashes, night sweats, headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myalgias, arthralgias, or rash.\nCurrent medications included levothyroxine and probiotics. There were no known allergies. The patient had previously traveled to the southwestern United States, North and East Africa, western Europe, and South and Southeast Asia. She currently lived in a suburban area of New England with her husband and cats in a house that had mold. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 98/66 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.9. She appeared well. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the abdomen was soft and nontender; there was no hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The right knee and leg had healed surgical scars. The skin examination was normal.\nThe eosinophil count was 1760 per microliter. Tests for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and strongyloidiasis were negative. The urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Vincent V. Dinculescu: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed calcified, nonenlarged subcarinal lymph nodes, along with calcified lesions in the right lung, liver, and spleen, findings suggestive of granulomatous disease. There was also a low-attenuation hepatic lesion measuring 1.6 cm in diameter, which was probably a cyst.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Chest and Abdomen.\nDr. Erdil: A diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 78-year-old man was evaluated in the cardiology clinic of this hospital because of biventricular myocardial wall thickening, progressive mitral regurgitation, and ventricular arrhythmias.\nThe patient had been a distinguished multisport athlete in high school and college. However, in his 20s, he found that he was unable to perform competitively, and he noticed that he did not sweat as much as his teammates. After an episode of sports-related exertional dizziness, he was evaluated by a physician, and a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was considered.\nTwenty-five years before the current evaluation, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 19 mm (reference value, \u226411), a left ventricular ejection fraction of 74% (reference range, 50 to 75), mitral valve thickening, and trace mitral regurgitation, with no left ventricular outflow gradient. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle-branch block, precordial J-point elevation, and QRS voltage that met the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure 1A). The patient\u2019s blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, and he started treatment with metoprolol succinate and then also with amlodipine for elevated blood pressure.\nFIGURE 1\n\nElectrocardiograms.\nDuring the next 10 years, the patient had intermittent chest discomfort, exertional dyspnea, and leg edema. The chest discomfort and exertional dyspnea were most likely to occur when he was walking or after he had eaten a meal. He was evaluated by three cardiologists; treatment with metoprolol succinate and amlodipine was continued, treatment with enalapril was started, and triamterene\u2013hydrochlorothiazide was administered as needed for leg edema.\nA repeat TTE reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 20 mm, a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular wall thickening, left atrial enlargement, mitral valve thickening, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, aortic valve thickening, and mild ascending aortic dilatation (39 mm), with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. An exercise stress test followed by imaging performed with the use of sestamibi (known as a sestamibi stress test) revealed left ventricular wall thickening, with no perfusion defects. Coronary angiography revealed evidence of chronic total occlusion of the distal left anterior descending artery, with collateral flow from both the left and right coronary arteries. Left ventriculography revealed hyperdynamic left ventricular function and 2+ mitral regurgitation (see Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 28 mm Hg (reference range, 5 to 10), with no left ventricular intracavitary gradient, including during ventricular ectopic beats and during the Valsalva maneuver, and with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The blood pressure remained well controlled while the patient was taking metoprolol, amlodipine, and enalapril.\nNine years before the current evaluation, the patient had complete heart block with symptomatic bradycardia (Figure 1B), with associated nausea, dizziness, and chest discomfort. A temporary transvenous pacing wire was placed; the results of coronary angiography performed at that time were unchanged from the previous study. The creatinine level was 1.2 mg per deciliter (106 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]); the blood levels of electrolytes and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis. A dual-chamber implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) was placed. Four months later, atrial fibrillation developed. Cardioversion was performed with guidance by transesophageal echocardiography, resulting in sinus rhythm. However, atrial fibrillation recurred after 3 days. Treatment with amiodarone and warfarin was begun.\nDuring the next 5 years, recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. A repeat TTE showed a left ventricular wall thickness of 23 mm and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.\nFour years before the current evaluation, during a holiday trip, the patient was hospitalized in another state because of pulmonary edema that developed after he had consumed food that was high in sodium. He was treated with intravenous furosemide and discharged with a prescription for oral furosemide. Findings on TTE were reportedly similar to those observed previously. Treatment with amlodipine was stopped because of lightheadedness.\nAt follow-up appointments during the next 4 years, the patient reported fatigue and exertional dyspnea that occurred after he had climbed one flight of stairs or when he was walking on an incline. In addition, he had nocturia once per night, slept on two pillows, and had intermittent wheezing, including episodes that awakened him from sleep. Treatment with oral furosemide (administered twice daily) was continued. Recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. Approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation, the patient sustained a fall that was unrelated to his cardiac condition. At that time, computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of hemorrhage or stroke but showed periventricular and deep white-matter hypodensities. Results of pulmonary-function testing were normal.\nThe patient presented for the current evaluation at the request of his two teenage grandsons, who wanted to know about any familial cardiac risk factors that could influence their participation in sports. A review of systems was notable for intermittent palpitations, chronic dry eyes, reduced hearing, tinnitus in both ears (greater in the right ear than in the left ear), restless legs, and constipation. The patient reported no headache, paresthesia, stroke symptoms, diarrhea, skin changes, or intolerance to heat or cold. His medical history included cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, atrioventricular block and atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, cataracts, and prostatic hypertrophy with carcinoma in situ. Medications included furosemide, warfarin, amiodarone, aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, enalapril, and tamsulosin, as well as inhaled fluticasone. Amiodarone had caused thyroiditis, which had been treated with a course of prednisone; there were no other known adverse reactions to medication.\nThe patient was a retired executive and lived with his spouse in Massachusetts. His family history was notable for brain cancer in his father, obstructive lung disease and lung cancer in his mother, and lung cancer in his sister, who had died from the disease. There was also a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in his sister and in a niece. His family was of Mediterranean origin; information about other relatives was limited. His son and grandsons were healthy, and his son had reportedly had normal results on an electrocardiogram and echocardiograms. The patient did not drink alcohol and had never used tobacco.\nOn examination, the heart rate was 79 beats per minute and the blood pressure 106/60 mm Hg. The weight was 89 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 26.6. There was a left ventricular heave. Auscultation revealed splitting of the S2 heart sound, a grade 3/6 systolic murmur that could be heard throughout the precordium and did not change during the Valsalva maneuver, and a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiated to the axilla; there was no S3 heart sound. There was trace leg edema and mild chronic venous stasis. The rest of the examination was normal.\nLaboratory test results were notable for a creatinine level of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 \u03bcmol per liter), a urea nitrogen level of 39 mg per deciliter (13.9 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), an international normalized ratio of 2.1 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), and an N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2523 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 1800), as well as 1+ protein on urinalysis. The blood levels of iron, glycated hemoglobin, thyrotropin, and free thyroxine were normal, and a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing.\nA TTE was obtained, and additional diagnostic tests were performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Margaret R. Connolly (Surgery): A 15-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and an ovarian mass.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 6 weeks before the current presentation, when lower abdominal pain developed along the midline. The pain was sharp and crampy, increased with movement, and decreased with lying down. During the next 24 hours, the pain shifted from the midline to the right side. The patient was taken to the emergency department of a hospital affiliated with this hospital for evaluation.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 125/82 mm Hg, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The lower abdomen had mild tenderness that was present on both sides but was greater on the right side. The abdomen was soft and nondistended. Bowel sounds were normal, and there was no rebound, guarding, or tenderness at the costovertebral angle. The white-cell count was 14,270 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,500) and the hemoglobin level 10.9 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The urinalysis was normal.

There were multiple follicular cysts, measuring up to 1.7 cm in diameter, in the left ovary. Doppler flow was normal in both ovaries. There was a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. The appendix was not visualized.\nDr. Connolly: Acetaminophen, ketorolac, and intravenous fluids were administered. A diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst was considered, and the patient was discharged home with plans to undergo repeat transabdominal ultrasonography 6 weeks later.\nAfter the patient was discharged from the emergency department, the abdominal pain slowly resolved. Three days after discharge, the patient resumed competitive long-distance running. Five weeks later, and 4 days before the current presentation, she participated in a running competition. The next day, abdominal pain recurred, and the patient was unable to go to school. She took ibuprofen, but it did not alleviate the pain. She was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nThe patient reported that the current episode of abdominal pain was similar to the episode that had occurred 6 weeks earlier. She had no fever, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dysuria, hematuria, frequent urination, or vaginal bleeding or discharge. She had noticed an increase in her waist size during the past 2 weeks and had difficulty fitting into her pants.\nThe patient had no notable medical history. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She had normal growth and development; menarche had not occurred. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. The patient lived in suburban New England with her parents and sister. She was not sexually active and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her parents and sister were healthy; menarche had occurred in her mother and sister when they were each 12 years of age.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/89 mm Hg, and the pulse 95 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.7. The right lower abdomen was firm and distended, with mild tenderness. Bowel sounds were normal, and there was no rebound, guarding, or evidence of a discrete mass or hepatosplenomegaly on palpation. Development of pubic hair and breasts was classified as Tanner stage 4 (with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development). The white-cell count was 16,120 per microliter and the hemoglobin level 10.1 g per deciliter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were performed.\nDr. Pourvaziri: Transabdominal ultrasonography with Doppler analysis revealed a heterogeneous mass, measuring 16.6 cm by 15.6 cm by 9.9 cm, that was inseparable from the right ovary with the use of probe pressure maneuvers. The mass had normal vascular flow and areas of increased echogenicity. The left ovary was normal, and there was a moderate-to-large amount of free fluid in the pelvis.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed a heterogeneously attenuating mass, measuring 17.8 cm by 13.6 cm by 8.6 cm, that displaced the bowel and pelvic viscera. The mass had prominent amorphous, peripherally enhancing components and internal vasculature. The right ovary was not definitively identified separately. There was a large amount of ascitic fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis (Figure 1), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, also showed a heterogeneous mass with thick, nodular, peripheral enhancement that appeared to originate from the right adnexa. The endometrial lining appeared thickened, measuring up to 22 mm in thickness.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Connolly: The patient was admitted to the hospital.

Hendler (Psychiatry): A 37-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of fever, shortness of breath, and suicidal ideation in March 2020, during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).\nTen days before this admission, fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias developed. The symptoms did not abate after the patient took aspirin and acetaminophen. Five days before this admission, she sought evaluation at the urgent care clinic of this hospital because Covid-19 had been diagnosed in two coworkers. A test for Covid-19 was not performed because of limited test availability; tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were not performed because of a statewide shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs. The patient was instructed to quarantine at home.\nDuring the next 5 days, the patient quarantined in a room in her apartment. Her husband periodically brought food to the door of the room. The fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias persisted; new shortness of breath and anosmia developed. She had decreased appetite, and she consumed minimal food and drink.\nOne day before this admission, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, and the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and ketorolac were administered, and she was discharged home with instructions to continue to quarantine.\nOn the day of admission, the patient had dizziness while standing, as well as shortness of breath, and she returned to the urgent care clinic of this hospital. The temperature was 38.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 38 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was anxious and tearful. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and oral acetaminophen were administered. The dizziness resolved, and the fever, shortness of breath, and anxiety decreased. The patient was advised to return home to quarantine; however, she disclosed that if she were sent home, she planned to overdose on medications to die by suicide because of her anxiety and feelings of sadness and loneliness. Owing to concern about the patient\u2019s risk of harming herself, an order authorizing temporary involuntary hospitalization was implemented. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was brought to the emergency department.\nOn evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported anxiety, palpitations, and shortness of breath and noted that her anxiety and feelings of isolation and loneliness had developed during quarantine. She also reported poor sleep, decreased energy, and anhedonia. The patient described that she felt like a burden to her husband and was terrified that she would transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to her children, including her 4-year-old son, who had been born prematurely and had a congenital pulmonary condition.\nIn addition, the patient reported a 1-week history of new, recurring nightmares in which she would see herself playing with her own severed body parts; these nightmares occurred more frequently during periods of high fever. She intermittently had the sensation that someone was in the room with her while she was awake, even though she was aware that she was alone. She disclosed that, on the previous day, she had had new suicidal ideation associated with fear of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to her family and that she had taken five aspirin\u2013paracetamol\u2013caffeine pills at once. There had been no history of suicidal ideation or attempt, self-harm, or homicidal ideation.\nThe patient had a history of depression and panic attacks when she was a teenager and had been treated for less than 1 year with a medication that she could not recall; the symptoms had resolved by 19 years of age, and there had been no mental health follow-up. She also had a history of migraines, which occurred four times per week. She took aspirin, acetaminophen, and aspirin\u2013paracetamol\u2013caffeine as needed; there were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in Central America and had been living in the United States for 19 years. She lived with her husband, four children, and mother-in-law in an urban area of New England in a community that was predominantly Latinx and that had a high rate of Covid-19\u2013related infections and deaths. The patient did not complete high school while she was living in Central America and was currently employed full time in a food-production factory. She reported that she enjoyed her job but that she had been reluctant to work during the Covid-19 pandemic because of concern about becoming ill; however, she described that she felt obligated to work to support her family. The patient did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from cancer.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 148/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared well-groomed and fatigued, and she was tearful with a depressed and dysphoric mood. Her behavior was described as \u201csullen,\u201d and there was limited eye contact and reduced psychomotor activity. Her speech, in Spanish, was fluent but was slow and mumbling, with reduced prosody. She had no derailment of thought, delusions, or obsessions, but she ruminated on her nightmares. She stated that she had no current suicidal ideation but that she might attempt suicide if she had to return to her children and expose them to SARS-CoV-2 again.\nNucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the chest revealed ground-glass opacities in the right middle and lower lobes and in the left lower lobe. Intravenous ceftriaxone, oral azithromycin, atorvastatin, and hydroxychloroquine were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Admission\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201316.0, 13.2\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 38.2\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 174,000\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 6660\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 5030\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 1570\nMonocytes, 200\u20131200, 60\n\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 3\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.55\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201333, 28\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201332, 34\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/liter), 110\u2013210, 318\nCreatine kinase (U/liter), 40\u2013150, 154\nHigh-sensitivity troponin T (ng/liter), 0\u20139, <6\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), 10\u2013200, 267\nD-dimer (ng/ml), <500, 551\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), <8.0, 51.1\n\nSerum toxicology tests:\nAcetaminophen (\u00b5g/ml), 0.0\u201325.0, 8.7\nEthanol (mg/dl), 0, 0\nSalicylates (mg/dl), 0.0\u201320.0, <0.3\nTricyclic antidepressants, Negative, Negative\n\nUrine toxicology tests:\nAmphetamines, Negative, Negative\nBarbiturates, Negative, Negative\nBenzodiazepines, Negative, Negative\nCannabinoids, Negative, Negative\nCocaine metabolites, Negative, Negative\nOpiates, Negative, Negative\n\nManagement decisions were made.",

The blood levels of troponin I and amylase were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults, Other Hospital), On Admission (Other Hospital), Reference Range (Adults, This Hospital), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.0\u201317.5, 11.8, 13.5\u201317.5, 12.3\nHematocrit (%), 39.0\u201353.0, 35.5, 41.0\u201353.0, 36.6\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4000\u201311,000, 10,500, 4500\u201311,000, 11,560\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 342,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 353,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 137\u2013146, 129, 135\u2013145, 132\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.6\u20135.2, 4.5, 3.4\u20135.0, 3.9\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013110, 94, 98\u2013108, 98\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 21\u201332, 29, 23\u201332, 24\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201323, 12, 8\u201325, 4\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.55\u20131.30, 0.51, 0.60\u20131.50, 0.61\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 9.3, 8.5\u201310.5, 8.3\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.2\u20135.0, 2.5, 3.3\u20135.0, \u2014\nC\u2011reactive protein (mg/dl), 0\u20130.80, 18.10, \u2014, \u2014\n\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed a new mass in the hilar region of the right upper lobe that measured 9.2 cm in greatest dimension. There was evidence of mass effect on the right main pulmonary artery and right main-stem and right upper-lobe bronchi, encasement of the right bronchus intermedius, occlusion of the superior vena cava (SVC) and narrowing of the right superior pulmonary vein, pulmonary emboli in the pulmonary artery of the left lower lobe, consolidation and atelectasis in the right upper lobe, chest-wall edema and extensive venous collateral vessels, and bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam and heparin were administered.\nThe next day, thoracentesis was performed, and 500 ml of cloudy yellow fluid was removed. On analysis of the pleural fluid, the fluid glucose level was 98 mg per deciliter (5.4 mmol per liter), the protein level 3.4 g per deciliter, the lactate dehydrogenase level 74 U per liter, and the pH 7.5. Gram\u2019s staining of the pleural fluid revealed no organisms, and no malignant cells were identified on cytologic analysis. Ultrasonography of the legs showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis. CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed no hemorrhage or stroke, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis reportedly revealed subcentimeter lucent areas in the iliac bones. The next day, the patient was transferred to the oncology unit of this hospital for further evaluation and care.\nOn admission to this hospital, the patient reported that, during the past 3 days, he had had progressive swelling of both upper arms, as well as pain in the right shoulder and arm. He noted weight loss of approximately 10 kg in the past 6 months, anorexia, hoarse voice, dizziness with changes in position (including bending forward), and dyspnea on exertion. A review of systems was negative for hemoptysis, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, changes in bowel habits, vomiting, abdominal pain, night sweats, headache, and diplopia.\nMedical history included surgery on the shoulder and leg. The patient took no medications, and there were no known adverse reactions to medications. He was self-employed and had worked in plumbing and engineering. He had smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 40 years and smoked marijuana occasionally. He drank five beers per day two times per week. His family history was notable for pancreatic cancer in his mother.\nThe temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 114/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 90 kg, the height 172 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 30.6. There was neck swelling and erythema, with no stridor. Jugular venous distention was present. On auscultation, the heart sounds were tachycardic but distant, and the lung sounds were markedly decreased on the right side. There was edema of the arms, with more pronounced swelling in the right arm than in the left arm, as well as erythema on the chest and evidence of engorged veins in the chest wall.\nThe blood level of glucose was normal, as were the results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia with premature atrial beats, borderline-low precordial lead voltage, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes.\nDr. Subba R. Digumarthy: Chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a persistent large central mass in the right upper lobe with occlusion of the right upper-lobe bronchus and collapse of the right upper lobe. There were multiple enlarged right mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes (Figure 1A). The brachiocephalic veins and the SVC showed no opacification, and the presence of extensive collateral veins in the right chest wall was consistent with venous occlusion and SVC syndrome (Figure 1B and 1C). An incidental cyst was noted in the upper pole of the left kidney. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion. There was no other evidence of cancer in the abdomen. The diagnostic possibilities included non\u2013small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer, metastasis from extrathoracic cancer, and lymphoma. Granulomatous infection and fibrosing mediastinitis were less likely in this case, given the imaging findings.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Chest.\nAngiography performed the next day confirmed that there was no opacification of the subclavian and brachiocephalic veins or the SVC and that extensive collateral veins were present in the arms. After removal of some of the clots, multiple overlapping stents were placed in the internal jugular veins, the brachiocephalic veins, and the SVC (Figure 1D and 1E and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).\nDr. Colleen M. Keyes: On the fourth hospital day, rigid bronchoscopy revealed diffusely friable mucosa and dynamic airway narrowing of the right main-stem bronchus. Much of the airway narrowing appeared to be due to extrinsic compression (Figure 2). Balloon dilation of the airway was performed but did not result in resolution of the airway narrowing; therefore, an endobronchial stent was not placed. Endobronchial ultrasonography revealed a 1.5-cm mass near the carina, and transbronchial needle aspiration was subsequently performed.\nFIGURE 2\n\nPhotograph Obtained during Bronchoscopy.\nDr. Daniel Shepherd: During fine-needle aspiration of the subcarinal mass, a rapid on-site evaluation of the specimen was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (Figure 3A and 3B) showed clusters of large epithelioid cells with anisonucleosis, irregularly contoured nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and occasional binucleated forms. There was a moderate amount of thin, delicate eosinophilic cytoplasm with occasional intracytoplasmic mucin. These findings are consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. No morphologic features of small-cell carcinoma were seen, and immunohistochemical staining for neuroendocrine markers and for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was negative.\nFIGURE 3\n\nSpecimens from Fine-Needle Aspiration.\nDr. Dudzinski: Radiation and medical oncology management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Jonathan E. Lu (Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear): A 61-year-old man was evaluated in an ophthalmology clinic affiliated with this hospital because of eyelid swelling.\nEight years before the current presentation, the patient noticed mild puffiness of the eyelids that was worst in the morning and typically resolved by midday. Five years before the current presentation, the eyelid swelling began to progressively worsen and to last throughout the day. The patient had a history of glaucoma; when the eyelid swelling began to interfere with his vision, he asked for a consultation with the ophthalmologist who had treated his glaucoma. A diagnosis of dermatochalasis with fat prolapse was suspected, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery clinic affiliated with this hospital for consideration of blepharoplasty.\nIn the clinic, the patient reported that eyelid puffiness was interfering with his ability to read and drive. He did not have dry eye. He had a sensation of pressure behind the eyes and intermittent double vision. There was generalized joint stiffness in the mornings that resolved after 1 hour. There was left lateral hip pain that radiated to the left buttock and thigh, with associated paresthesia in the left foot.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection had been diagnosed 31 years before the current presentation and was well controlled with antiretroviral therapy, although lipodystrophy had occurred with treatment. Other medical history included carpal tunnel syndrome, cataracts, depression, dyslipidemia, hypertension, allergic rhinitis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma, in addition to primary open-angle glaucoma. Surgical history included carpal tunnel release surgery (performed 2 months before the current presentation), intraocular lens replacement in both eyes, and lipectomy for the reduction of dorsocervical lipohypertrophy due to lipodystrophy. Medications included antiretroviral therapy (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide), bupropion, fluoxetine, triamterene, amlodipine, atorvastatin, inhaled albuterol, and topical testosterone. The administration of iodinated contrast material had caused hives. The patient lived part time in Florida and part time in New England. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit substances.\nOn examination, the corrected visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light. Confrontation testing revealed deficits in the outer superior temporal visual fields and the superior nasal visual fields, which abated with manual elevation of the eyelids. Supraduction and abduction were limited in both eyes. Soft edema of the upper and lower eyelids was present, along with mild erythema of the upper eyelids (Figure 1). The upper-eyelid skin was overhanging the lashes medially, a finding indicative of dermatochalasis. There was upper-eyelid ptosis. The globes were moderately resistant to retropulsion, and there was mild proptosis. The levator palpebrae superioris muscles had impaired function, with an eyelid elevation of 8 mm in the right eye and 11 mm in the left eye (reference range, 12 to 18). Slit-lamp examination revealed 1+ chemosis and trace injection in the conjunctivae; there was no evidence of superficial punctate keratopathy or cells in the anterior chambers. Funduscopic examination revealed an increased cup-to-disk ratio in the optic nerves, a finding consistent with the patient\u2019s known history of glaucoma. The tongue was enlarged, and there was dorsocervical lipohypertrophy on the posterior aspect of the neck.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs at Presentation.\nThe blood levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins were normal. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Laura V. Romo: Computed tomography (CT) of the face and orbits (Figure 2A and 2B), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral enlargement of the extraocular muscles and fat stranding in the orbits and elsewhere in the face. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the face and orbits (Figure 2C through 2F), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed orbital fat stranding and mild, symmetric, diffuse extraocular-muscle enlargement. A short-tau inversion recovery sequence showed an increased signal that spared the myotendinous junctions. Diffuse thickening and stranding of the skin on the preseptal eyelids and face, episcleritis along the posterior margin of both globes, and perineuritis around the optic nerves were also noted.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies of the Face and Orbits.\nDr. Lu: The blood levels of glucose and electrolytes and the results of kidney-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), lysozyme, rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 22 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). The blood IgG level was 1980 mg per deciliter (reference range, 767 to 1590), the IgG1 level 283 mg per deciliter (reference range, 341 to 894), and the IgG2 level 1750 mg per deciliter (reference range, 171 to 632); the blood IgG3 and IgG4 levels were normal. Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) was negative, including an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase. A rapid plasma reagin test was nonreactive. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infection was negative.\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Ian D. Cooley (Medicine): A 68-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of painful mouth ulcers and weight loss.\nThe patient had been well until 6 weeks before the current admission, when painful mouth ulcers and neck pain developed. He was evaluated at an urgent care center. He had reduced range of motion of the neck due to pain with flexion, extension, and rotation, but there was no spinal tenderness. There were small ulcers on the lower lip and gingivae. Cyclobenzaprine and acyclovir were prescribed.\nFive weeks before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician in a clinic at this hospital. He reported that neck pain on the right side and oral ulcers had persisted and that several new oral ulcers had developed. He had no rash, eye pain, joint pain or swelling, dysuria or genital lesions, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. The examination was notable for several large ulcers on the lips and tongue (Figure 1A). Treatment with acyclovir was continued. A direct immunofluorescence assay of a swab of an oral ulcer was negative for herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 and for varicella\u2013zoster virus. Blood tests were negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 and for syphilis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Four weeks before the current admission, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital. Erythema and watering of the left eye had developed, as had new skin lesions on the trunk and upper face. The examination revealed multiple ulcers on the lips and tongue (Figure 1B) and two pink crusted papules with hemorrhage on the right temple. There were scattered pustules on the lower back and right flank. An ophthalmologic examination revealed a pinguecula on the nasal side of the right eye with mild surrounding inflammation but was otherwise normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney- and liver-function tests. HLA typing was positive for the HLA-B51 allele; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nThe patient was evaluated by the rheumatology and dermatology services. The decision was made to pursue a skin biopsy before an oral biopsy. A biopsy of a pustule on the patient\u2019s back was performed, and examination of the specimen revealed mild spongiosis, neutrophilic granulomatous inflammation, and a superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils and occasional eosinophils. Colchicine was prescribed, along with oxycodone and lidocaine oral solution, for the treatment of a working diagnosis of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. Outpatient follow-up with the rheumatology service was arranged.\nThree days after discharge from the emergency department, the patient reported that the oral ulcers had not abated. Treatment with prednisone was started, and colchicine was continued.\nTwo weeks before the current admission, the patient was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. Prednisone treatment had led to only transient healing of the oral ulcers. The patient had pain with eating and speaking and had lost 10 kg of body weight in 3 weeks. The neck pain, the eye watering, and several skin lesions had resolved. The examination revealed extensive ulceration of the upper and lower labial mucosa and of the ventrolateral surface of the tongue on both sides, as well as two focal ulcerations, measuring 0.5 cm in diameter, involving the soft palate on the left side (Figure 1C and 1D). There were multiple purple-red, scaly papules involving the skin of the arms and lower legs. There was no evidence of a joint abnormality. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Prednisone was switched to oral methylprednisolone, and treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was started for possible bowel-associated dermatosis\u2013arthritis syndrome. Omeprazole, which the patient had taken for many years, was stopped because of peripheral eosinophilia. An evaluation in the oral medicine clinic at an affiliated hospital was arranged, with plans for oral and skin biopsies.\nOne week before the current admission, a biopsy of lower labial mucosa revealed squamous mucosa and parenchyma of the minor salivary glands, with mild nonspecific chronic inflammation. A skin biopsy was notable for epidermal ulceration with impetiginization and associated folliculitis. Dexamethasone oral rinses were prescribed, as was trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci infection.\nDuring the next 7 days, the ulcers worsened and the patient had ongoing pain that was unresponsive to oxycodone. He was unable to eat and was admitted to this hospital for pain control and further evaluation.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included methylprednisolone, colchicine, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, lorazepam, and oxycodone, as well as dexamethasone oral rinses. The patient was allergic to clarithromycin, which had caused a rash. He had quit smoking 30 years earlier, and he consumed 10 alcoholic drinks per week. There was no illicit drug use. The patient lived with his wife in a suburban area of New England. He had traveled to Western Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean. He was employed part-time as a contractor. His family history included prostate cancer in his father and type 2 diabetes mellitus in his mother.\nOn examination, the temperature was 35.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 134/56 mm Hg, the heart rate 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.4. The patient looked uncomfortable, with an edematous tongue and multiple oral ulcers. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy or joint abnormality. Skin examination revealed a slightly raised pustule, measuring 2 mm in diameter, on the anterior aspect of the thigh. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Markus Y. Wu: Computed tomography (CT) of chest and abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed subtle centrilobular ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of the lungs, as well as prominent right hilar and left supraclavicular lymph nodes, each measuring 1 cm in diameter (Figure 2).\nFIGURE 2\n\nCT Scan of the Chest.\nDr. Cooley: A diagnostic procedure was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Kathleen M. McFadden (Medicine): An 84-year-old man was admitted to this hospital after having a fall.\nThree weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital because of a transient episode of gross hematuria. Urinalysis showed trace blood (reference value, negative), and microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed 4 or 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 3). Results of tests of coagulation were normal, and the complete blood count showed anemia, which had been diagnosed previously and was stable as compared with findings obtained 11 months earlier. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed a linear density in the bladder that measured 10 mm in diameter. The cause of the episode of hematuria was thought to be a kidney stone that had passed into the bladder. The patient was discharged home with a plan to follow up in the urology clinic affiliated with the other hospital; he was instructed to continue treatment with rivaroxaban, which he had been taking for many years to prevent stroke in the context of atrial fibrillation.\nOne week before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of the other hospital after he had expressive aphasia as well as numbness on the right side of his face and in his right arm, which had resolved before he arrived at the emergency department. He had missed multiple doses of rivaroxaban in the 2 weeks before the onset of these symptoms. CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly did not show evidence of stroke or clinically significant stenosis in the anterior or posterior cerebral circulation. The complete blood count showed that his anemia remained stable. The blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 1+ blood, and microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed 6 to 10 red cells per high-power field and 6 to 9 white cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2).\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Other Hospital), 1 Wk before Current Presentation (Other Hospital), Reference Range (This Hospital), On Presentation (This Hospital), Hospital Day 4\n\nHematocrit (%), 42.0\u201352.0, 35.2, 41.0\u201353.0, 31.8, 34.9\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 14.0\u201318.0, 11.1, 13.5\u201317.5, 10.5, 11.0\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201310,800, 4700, 4500\u201311,000, 9870, 8030\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 2000\u20137000, 2690, 1800\u20137700, 9270, 7040\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20133000, 1220, 1000\u20134800, 90, 880\nMonocytes, 200\u20131000, 480, 200\u20131200, 420, 910\nEosinophils, 0\u2013500, 200, 0\u2013900, 0, 10\nBasophils, 0\u2013100, 70, 0\u2013300, 90, 30\nBands, 0\u201390, 20, 0\u2013100, 70, 70\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 132,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 143,000, 210,000\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 6\u201319, 21, 8\u201325, 40, 20\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.4\u20131.2, 1.0, 0.60\u20131.50, 2.01, 1.24\n\nThe patient was admitted to the other hospital. On hospital day 2, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed moderate generalized atrophy and small-vessel ischemic changes. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%, increased estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and intact intraventricular and atrial septa. The patient was told that his symptoms were due to a transient ischemic attack, and he was discharged home with instructions to continue taking rivaroxaban and with a plan to follow up in the neurology clinic affiliated with the other hospital.\nOn the day of the current presentation, the patient fell in his bathroom at his home. Emergency medical services were called. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 130 mg per deciliter (7.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 100 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). The patient was not able to recall the events that led to the fall. He was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported that he had felt unwell after discharge from the other hospital, with symptoms including generalized weakness and dizziness. He had no abdominal pain, chest pain, or urinary symptoms. His wife reported that before the patient\u2019s admission to the other hospital, he had been completely independent, performing activities such as driving and grocery shopping. However, since his discharge from the other hospital, he had become progressively weaker and had required assistance with walking and dressing. The patient\u2019s wife also reported an area of redness on the patient\u2019s left arm where an intravenous catheter had been placed during admission to the other hospital.\nOther medical history included atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, hypertension, and prostate cancer that had been treated with radiotherapy. Medications included amlodipine, finasteride, furosemide, losartan, rivaroxaban, rosuvastatin, and venlafaxine. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs; he smoked one pack of cigarettes per day. He was retired and lived in Massachusetts with his wife.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 145/68 mm Hg, the pulse 61 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.4. The patient appeared ill with dry mucous membranes. The heart sounds were irregular. There was an area of erythema overlying the left antecubital fossa with mild induration but no fluctuance. He had an abrasion over the left knee. He was cooperative but confused and intermittently answered questions inappropriately; he occasionally stared off into space and did not respond to questions. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation. Urinalysis showed 3+ blood (reference value, negative) and 3+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative); microscopic evaluation of the urinary sediment revealed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2), more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10), and 1+ bacteria. The blood level of creatinine was 2.01 mg per deciliter (178 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and the blood level of high-sensitivity troponin T 68 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, were negative. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Brian B. Ghoshhajra: CT angiography of the head and cervical spine showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of an acute infarct and no acute fracture in the cervical spine. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also performed. A small pleural effusion was detected in the left lung (Figure 1A). Moderate-to-severe coronary-artery calcification with multichamber cardiomegaly was present, and calcifications were scattered throughout the thoracic aorta, which showed aneurysmal dilatation (Figure 1D). An indeterminate left adrenal nodule that measured 15 mm in diameter was detected, along with circumferential wall thickening in the urinary bladder and two stones in the urinary bladder that measured up to 5 mm in diameter; seeds from previous brachytherapy were also visible (Figure 1C). Two focal areas of hyperdensity, each measuring up to 6 mm in diameter, that were seen along the posterior aspect of the spinal canal at the level of the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae were most likely meningiomas (Figure 1A and 1B). There was a focal outpouching of the aorta superior to the origin of the celiac artery and mural thickening of the aorta at the level of the aortic hiatus with adjacent fat stranding (Figure 1D).\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial CT Angiogram of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.\nDr. McFadden: While the patient was in the emergency department, the high-sensitivity troponin T levels, which were checked 1 and 3 hours after the initial troponin measurement, were 71 ng per liter and 70 ng per liter, respectively. A bolus of 500 ml of normal saline was administered. A presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection was made, and urine was obtained for culture. Treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with furosemide and losartan was stopped, but his other home medications were continued.\nOn hospital day 1, the urine culture grew more than 100,000 colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus. MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was degraded by motion artifact, but there was no evidence of an acute infarct. A TTE showed an LVEF of 60%, a dilated right ventricle with normal systolic function, mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and an elevated estimated right ventricular systolic pressure. Blood was obtained for culture, and treatment with ceftriaxone was continued.\nOn hospital day 2, the patient remained afebrile. An ultrasound image of the left antecubital fossa showed an avascular hypoechoic collection, measuring 1.7 cm by 0.5 cm by 1.3 cm, overlying a partially occluded superficial vein. The patient was evaluated by the orthopedic surgery consultant; no surgical intervention was recommended. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the urine culture isolate revealed methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Treatment with ceftriaxone was stopped, and treatment with intravenous vancomycin and cefazolin was initiated. Blood cultures obtained on hospital day 1 grew gram-positive cocci in clusters in one of four bottles. Additional blood cultures were obtained.\nOn hospital day 3, the patient had sudden chest pain while resting in bed. The pain was located over the left third intercostal space and did not radiate; the patient rated the pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain lasted 5 minutes and resolved without intervention. On evaluation by the treating physician immediately after the pain resolved, the blood pressure was 193/80 mm Hg. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes. A chest radiograph showed a small left pleural effusion similar to that previously seen on CT angiography and a confluent retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe. The blood level of high-sensitivity troponin T was 46 ng per liter. Treatment with losartan, which had been stopped on admission to the hospital, was restarted. During the next 12 hours, the blood pressure decreased to 167/81 mm Hg.\nOn hospital day 4, the patient had chest pain that was different in character from the pain he had had the previous day. The pain, which he rated at 10, radiated into the abdomen. The patient appeared distressed. The blood pressure was 173/85 mm Hg. The pain was unchanged on palpation over the chest and abdomen. Treatment with low-dose intravenous hydromorphone was initiated, and the pain decreased to 5 out of 10. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nA diagnostic test was performed, and management decisions were made.",

Witkin: A 21-year-old male college student was evaluated in the cardiology clinic at this hospital, before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, because of progressive dyspnea.\nWhen the patient was in his early teens, he was evaluated for intermittent exertional dyspnea and received a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma. Montelukast and an albuterol inhaler were prescribed for use as needed; however, he had not used these medications in the 2 years before the current presentation.\nSeveral months before the current presentation, the patient noticed increased dyspnea, which occurred when he was playing sports such as volleyball or walking on campus, specifically when walking at an incline or while carrying parcels. Friends had commented on his inability to \u201ckeep up\u201d during games and while walking.\nSix days before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated for dyspnea by his primary care physician at a hospital affiliated with this hospital. The heart rate was 71 beats per minute and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG), transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and chest radiograph were obtained.\nDr. David M. Dudzinski: An ECG (Figure 1A) showed right bundle-branch block and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. A TTE (Figure 1B and 1C) showed right ventricular enlargement with severe hypokinesia and hypertrophy (estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, 84 mm Hg), right atrial enlargement, flattening of the interventricular septum during systole and diastole, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and inferior vena cava dilatation.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCardiac Studies.\nDr. Anuradha S. Shenoy-Bhangle: A frontal chest radiograph (Figure 2A) showed enlarged hila and an irregular calcification over the right upper quadrant.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies of the Chest.\nDr. Witkin: The patient was referred to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the heart rate was 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 130/82 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. The white-cell differential count and blood levels of calcium, amylase, lipase, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Echocardiography performed after the administration of agitated saline (a \u201cbubble study\u201d) did not reveal an atrial septal defect, but a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting was identified.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults, Other Hospital), 1 Day before Current Presentation (Other Hospital), Reference Range (Adults, This Hospital), On Current Presentation (This Hospital)\n\nB-type natriuretic peptide (pg/ml), <100.0, 61.6, \u2014, \u2014\nD-dimer (\u00b5g/ml), <0.50, 0.56, \u2014, \u2014\nTroponin I (ng/ml), <0.04, 0.03, \u2014, \u2014\nCreatine kinase (ng/ml), 32\u2013294, 172, \u2014, \u2014\nCreatine kinase MB (ng/ml), <5.1, 1.4, \u2014, \u2014\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201310, 6, \u2014, \u2014\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 16.5, 13.5\u201317.5, 16.1\nHematocrit (%), 38.0\u201350.0, 48.6, 41.0\u201353.0, 47.3\nRed-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4,320,000\u20135,720,000, 5,910,000, 4,500,000\u20135,900,000, 5,580,000\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4000\u201311,000, 5700, 4500\u201311,000, 5400\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 135,000\u2013400,000, 203,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 211,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 136\u2013145, 141, 135\u2013145, 140\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.5\u20135.2, 3.9, 3.4\u20135.0, 3.5\nChloride (mmol/liter), 99\u2013109, 108, 100\u2013108, 105\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 20\u201331, 24, 23\u201332, 21\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 9\u201323, 10, 8\u201325, 21\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.5\u20131.3, 0.9, 0.60\u20131.50, 0.95\nGlucose (mg/dl), 74\u2013106, 82, 70\u2013110, 69\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.5\u20134.8, 4.3, 3.3\u20135.0, 4.3\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201349, 48, 10\u201355, 41\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 6\u201340, 61, 10\u201340, 52\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013115, 160, 45\u2013115, 148\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.3\u20131.2, 2.1, 0.0\u20131.0, 1.6\nHIV type 1 and 2 antibodies and antigens, \u2014, \u2014, Negative, Negative\nAntinuclear antibody, \u2014, \u2014, Negative at 1:40 and 1:160, Positive at 1:40, negative at 1:80 and 1:160\nAnti\u2013Scl-70 antibody, \u2014, \u2014, Negative, Negative\nRheumatoid factor (IU/ml), \u2014, \u2014, <30, <30\n\nDr. Shenoy-Bhangle: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material and in accordance with a pulmonary embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism. However, the main pulmonary artery was dilated (diameter, 39 mm; normal value, 29 in men and 27 in women), as were segmental pulmonary artery branches. The right ventricle was enlarged. Bilateral mild, diffuse, centrilobular ground-glass nodules were noted, along with interlobular septal thickening. A 45-mm area of coarse calcification was seen in the right lobe of the liver.\nDr. Witkin: The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital with a plan for follow-up the next morning in the cardiology clinic at this hospital. At the follow-up visit, the system review was notable for snoring (reported by his roommates) and dyspnea that occurred after he ascended three flights of stairs. He had no chest pain or pressure, edema, orthopnea, dyspnea at night, light-headedness, syncope, fever, recent illness, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, change in weight, jaundice, abdominal pain or distention, change in bowel habits, nausea, anorexia, hair or nail changes, or rash.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for internal hemorrhoids with an episode of rectal bleeding, as well as a traumatic ankle sprain 3 years before the current presentation. He took no medications but had previously taken methylphenidate and atomoxetine for a learning disability characterized by inattention and difficulty with auditory processing. He took several supplements for calming and increased attention, which included the following ingredients: rhodiola extract, phosphatidylserine, melatonin, astaxanthin, and amino acids such as glutamate, glycine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, taurine, theanine, and tyrosine. He consumed protein shakes before workouts and had used creatine supplements 2 years earlier. He had received an influenza vaccine and all the routine immunizations that are required to attend school.\nThe patient was a student at a local college. During the current school year, he had been exercising at the gym three times per week, doing mostly isometric exercise and some aerobic exercise. He had never used cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, marijuana, or illicit substances. He lived with roommates, and there were no known allergic or environmental exposures in their apartment. His family history was notable for inflammatory bowel disease in his father, coronary artery disease in several paternal relatives, myocardial infarction in his maternal grandfather (when he was in his 70s), colon cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after long-term smoking in his maternal grandmother, and asthma in his maternal aunt. His two siblings were healthy.\nOn examination, the heart rate was 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg in the right arm and 122/72 mm Hg in the left arm, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was in the supine position and breathing ambient air, and the level decreased to 90% after he ascended two flights of stairs. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.6. The patient appeared to have normal development and was breathing comfortably. The sclerae were anicteric. The jugular venous pressure was 14 cm of water. A parasternal heave was detected. On auscultation, the lungs were clear, the P2 heart sound was accentuated, and a grade 3/6 early systolic murmur was present at the left sternal border. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Clubbing of the fingers and toes was present, without cyanosis.\nAn ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute, right bundle-branch block, and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. Blood levels of thyrotropin and glycated hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nAdditional tests were performed the next day. Spirometry showed normal lung volumes and a reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO; 71% of the predicted value). A bronchodilator test showed no clinically significant response to an inhaled bronchodilator. Right heart catheterization revealed a right atrial pressure of 6 mm Hg, a right ventricular pressure of 90/7 mm Hg, a pulmonary arterial pressure of 89/28 mm Hg (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 57 mm Hg), and a pulmonary arterial wedge pressure of 8 mm Hg. The central venous oxygen saturation was 67% (reference range, 60 to 70), the mixed venous oxygen saturation 71% (reference range, 65 to 75), and the arterial oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The cardiac output, measured by means of thermodilution, was 6.2 liters per minute. The pulmonary vascular resistance was approximately 8 Wood units. After the patient inhaled 30 ppm of nitric oxide, the mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 52 mm Hg and the cardiac output 6.0 liters per minute.\nA diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Yuefan Chen (Anesthesia, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine): A 59-year-old woman had hypotension and electrocardiographic (ECG) ST-segment abnormalities after the administration of anesthetic agents while she was in the operating room of this hospital.\nEighteen weeks before the current presentation, features of acromegaly were observed on routine physical examination by the patient\u2019s primary care provider at another hospital. The blood level of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) was 595 ng per milliliter (reference range, 50 to 317) and the growth hormone level 9.1 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 7.1). The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital.\nEleven weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic. She reported that her shoe size, which had been stable since young adulthood, had recently increased by two sizes. She also reported a deepening of her voice, fatigue, headaches, arthralgias, oily skin, skin tags, and acne on her face and back. She had had an intentional weight loss of 12.7 kg during the previous 9 months. The facial features were coarse, and there was no frontal bossing. Visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The tongue was thick and obscured the soft palate; the lower jaw was enlarged, with increased spacing between the teeth. The hands and feet were large and fleshy. Scattered skin tags were present on the neck. Auscultation of the heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a normal-sized pituitary gland with a well-circumscribed area of hypoenhancement that measured 9 mm by 7 mm by 10 mm. The patient was referred to the neurosurgery clinic of this hospital, and an elective microscopic transsphenoidal hypophysectomy was subsequently recommended.\nSeven weeks before the current presentation, an extensive preoperative evaluation was performed, given the patient\u2019s diagnosis of acromegaly. As part of the preoperative evaluation, additional history was obtained. The patient\u2019s medical history included hypertension, prediabetes, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, polycystic ovary syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and scoliosis. Physical activity was limited by pain in the knees; she could climb a flight of stairs but did so very slowly because of knee pain. She had no chest pain or dyspnea. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan, and ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed for joint pain. Hydroxychloroquine had caused leukopenia, and meperidine had caused gastrointestinal upset. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her husband and worked in an office. She did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; she drank alcohol rarely. Multiple maternal and paternal family members had cardiovascular disease.\nECG revealed sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, including a T-wave inversion in lead III. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular volume and systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, and there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal; the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 28 mm Hg. Mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation were present. A pharmacologic stress test, with myocardial perfusion imaging performed after the administration of regadenoson, revealed no evidence of ischemia.\nThree weeks before the current presentation, the patient was taken to the operating room for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. The preoperative temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 131/69 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 35.7. Midazolam was administered, and anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, propofol, lidocaine, and rocuronium. Tracheal intubation was moderately challenging because of the presence of redundant tissue in the supraglottic region. During intubation, the oxygen saturation decreased to 79% but normalized in less than 1 minute. Inhaled sevoflurane (an anesthetic) and dexamethasone and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam were administered, remifentanil and phenylephrine infusions were started, and the patient was placed in a level, supine position for the procedure.\nAfter the induction of anesthesia, before the surgical procedure was initiated, the blood pressure gradually decreased (Figure 1A). Sixteen minutes after induction began, the blood pressure was 96/48 mm Hg and the heart rate 75 beats per minute; 29 minutes after induction began, the blood pressure had decreased to 67/36 mm Hg and the heart rate to 71 beats per minute. Telemetric monitoring (Figure 2A) showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads and ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads. Aspirin was administered rectally, the rate of the phenylephrine infusion was increased, and multiple boluses of phenylephrine and an ephedrine bolus were administered. The blood pressure increased to 110/54 mm Hg and the heart rate to 111 beats per minute. Telemetric monitoring showed resolution of the ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Findings on ECG and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) performed in the operating room were consistent with those of the preoperative ECG and TTE. The procedure was aborted, the patient was weaned from the vasopressor therapies, and the trachea was extubated. She was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit.\nFIGURE 1\n\nIntraoperative Vital Signs.\nFIGURE 2\n\nIntraoperative Telemetric Monitoring.\nOn admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, the blood level of troponin T was 10 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 9); 1 hour later, the level had decreased to 8 ng per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography was normal. Computed tomographic angiography of the coronary arteries revealed moderate stenosis of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery. The intraoperative ST-segment elevations were attributed to coronary vasospasm. Treatment with amlodipine and isosorbide mononitrate was initiated for coronary vasospasm, and treatment with atorvastatin was started for nonobstructive coronary artery disease. After discussion among the cardiology, neurosurgery, and anesthesia teams, it was determined that the patient remained a candidate for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, particularly because the surgery could offer a cure for her acromegaly; the procedure was rescheduled.

Chen: A 34-year-old woman was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital for the management of relapsed, metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\nThe patient had been well until 3 years before this evaluation, when acute abdominal and back pain developed, and she presented to the emergency department of another hospital. As part of the evaluation, abdominal ultrasonography was performed and reportedly revealed a lesion in the right lobe of the liver. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Theodore T. Pierce: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a heterogeneous, hypoenhancing, lobulated lesion that measured 6.1 cm by 4.5 cm (Figure 1A), with imaging characteristics suggestive of primary or metastatic cancer. The lesion was associated with peripheral biliary dilatation, which suggested biliary obstruction (Figure 1B); restricted diffusion, indicating high tissue density (Figure 1C); peripheral rim enhancement on arterial phase imaging, reflecting increased vascularity at the rim of the lesion (Figure 1D); and delayed enhancement of the more central areas of the lesion, indicating fibrosis (Figure 1E and 1F). Taken together, these features are atypical of benign lesions, such as hemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatic adenoma, and are most consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial MRI of the Liver.\nPositron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT), performed after the administration of intravenous 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed FDG avidity in the hepatic mass in the right lobe. No additional sites of hypermetabolism were noted.\nDr. Chen: Given the concern for cancer, blood samples were obtained for testing for tumor markers. The level of CA 19-9 was elevated, at 110 IU per milliliter (reference value, <35), but the levels of alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal. An ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy of the liver mass in the right lobe was performed, and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Kathy M. Tran: A 33-year-old pregnant woman with ulcerative colitis was admitted to this hospital during the summer at 10 weeks of gestation because of fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, and headache.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before this admission, when fever, rigors, nausea, and vomiting developed. During the next 3 days, the symptoms worsened; the patient was unable to eat, drink, or take medications. She reported abdominal pain and cramping on the left side that she described as being similar to previous flares of ulcerative colitis; she also had nonbloody diarrhea. The patient called the obstetrics clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems was notable for fatigue, mild headache, neck pain, and photophobia. The patient reported no hematochezia, pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, dysuria, or joint pain. Ulcerative colitis had been diagnosed 11 years earlier; at the time of the diagnosis, she began treatment with azathioprine but stopped after 1 year because of severe fatigue. The patient had taken mesalamine and sulfasalazine intermittently for disease flares but typically stopped after a few months of treatment. Exacerbations of ulcerative colitis occurred approximately every year and were associated with fevers, rigors, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea.\nNine months before this admission, Clostridioides difficile colitis developed, and the patient was successfully treated with oral vancomycin. Three weeks before the current admission, she was admitted to this hospital for a flare of ulcerative colitis; intravenous methylprednisolone, hydromorphone, and ondansetron were administered, and mesalamine was restarted. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed mild erythema and friable mucosa with a decreased vascular pattern in the sigmoid colon.\nDr. Craig R. Audin: A transvaginal ultrasound image obtained during that admission showed a single viable intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks of gestation and trace subchorionic hemorrhage.\nDr. Tran: The patient was discharged after 7 days once most of the symptoms had abated, although nausea persisted. The patient had had two previous successful pregnancies that had resulted in cesarean deliveries at full term. The patient reported that she had received all the usual childhood immunizations. Routine prenatal serologic screening during the current pregnancy showed immunity to varicella but not to rubella. Tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Other history included anemia, chronic back pain, migraines, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety.\nAt the time of the current admission, medications included prednisone, mesalamine, omeprazole, ondansetron, hydromorphone, tramadol, cyclobenzaprine, sumatriptan, gabapentin, lorazepam, sertraline, pyridoxine, cholecalciferol, and prenatal vitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with her male partner, with whom she was monogamous, as well as her two children. She worked as an administrator. She did not eat sushi or rare or raw meat, and she did not consume unpasteurized milk or cheese. She had no known sick contacts or exposure to animals. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. Her mother had coronary artery disease, her father inflammatory bowel disease, and her sister depression. Her brother and two children were well.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 118/61 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared tired and uncomfortable. The abdominal examination was remarkable for a healed surgical scar; there was diffuse tenderness that was most painful in the lower quadrants. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level was 7.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), which was similar to the patient\u2019s baseline level. Urinalysis was normal. Blood specimens were obtained for microbiologic culture.

There was trace fluid in the right lower quadrant; however, the appendix was not visualized (Figure 1B).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Abdomen.\nDr. Tran: Intravenous fluids, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and hydromorphone were administered; mesalamine was continued, and a tapering of the prednisone dose was begun. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and care.\nThe next day, the abdominal pain persisted and was most severe in the right upper and right lower quadrants. The headache had increased in severity; it was pulsating in quality and was worst in the frontal region, with radiation to the occipital region and posterior neck. There was mild photophobia but no neck stiffness or limitation in the range of motion in the neck. Empirical treatment with intravenous ampicillin\u2013sulbactam and prophylaxis with oral vancomycin were started.\nOn the third hospital day, the systolic blood pressure declined to 70 mm Hg; after intravenous fluids were administered, the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Ultrasound images of the uterus obtained at the bedside confirmed a fetal heartbeat. A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless, with a glucose level of 63 mg per deciliter (3.5 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a protein level of 17 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were 0 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5). Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF revealed no neutrophils and very few mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified.\nDr. Audin: Three days later, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1C through 1F), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a normal gravid uterus. On T2-weighted imaging, there were rounded areas of myometrial thickening with low signal intensity that were consistent with focal myometrial contractions, as well as a thin band of low signal intensity surrounding the fetus that was consistent with chorioamniotic separation; both of these findings were considered to be normal in the first trimester. The appendix was normal, without wall thickening, dilatation, or adjacent inflammatory changes. Although evaluation of the bowel was limited in the absence of oral and intravenous contrast material, the rectum also appeared normal, without obvious signs of active or chronic inflammation.\nA diagnosis was made.",

Bunnell (Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 31-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital 15 days after the birth of her first child because of abdominal pain and fever.\nThe patient had received routine prenatal care at this hospital. Serologic screening during the pregnancy showed immunity to rubella. Rectovaginal culture was positive for group B streptococcus. Tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative.\nSixteen days before this admission, the patient went into labor at 38 weeks 1 day of gestation. She was admitted to this hospital. The white-cell count was 13,800 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), and the hemoglobin level was 14.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0); treatment with intravenous penicillin was started. On hospital day 2, an epidural anesthetic agent was administered. Artificial rupture of the membranes revealed clear, odorless fluid, and infusion of oxytocin was started. Six hours after artificial rupture of the membranes, the patient gave birth to a healthy baby by vaginal delivery. Three minutes later, the placenta was delivered intact. Immediately after delivery, hemorrhage due to uterine atony occurred; there was an estimated blood loss of 500 ml. Bimanual massage of the uterus was performed, and oxytocin and methylergonovine were administered; hemostasis was subsequently achieved. A perineal laceration was repaired. The patient began breast-feeding, and on postpartum day 1, she was discharged.\nSix days before the current admission, on postpartum day 9, pain in the left upper quadrant developed. The pain was dull, radiated to the left flank and back, and was worse with movement and deep breathing. The patient presented to a local urgent care clinic; urine was obtained for culture, and empirical treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was started.\nFive days before this admission, on postpartum day 10, abdominal pain persisted, and a fever with a temporal temperature of 38.3\u00b0C developed. The patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. She rated the abdominal pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. A review of systems was notable for nausea and minimal lochia; there was no diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, or breast tenderness.\nOn examination, the abdomen was soft, and there was mild tenderness on palpation of the left upper quadrant, the uterine fundus, the suprapubic region, and the left costovertebral angle. Pelvic examination, including examination with the use of a speculum, revealed no dehiscence, drainage, or hematoma at the site of the perineal laceration repair and no discharge from the cervical os; there was mild cervical motion tenderness. The white-cell count was 20,700 per microliter. The level of hemoglobin was 11.4 g per deciliter. Blood cultures were obtained. The urine culture obtained at the urgent care clinic was positive for group B streptococcus. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with ceftriaxone was started, and the patient was admitted to the hospital for presumed pyelonephritis.

    "user_input": "Dr. J. Sawalla Guseh: A 38-year-old man was evaluated at the cardiology clinic of this hospital because of exertional chest discomfort.\nThe patient had been a competitive athlete in the past and had remained an avid runner. Approximately 15 years before the current evaluation, while he was running, he had episodes of flushing with diffuse cutaneous swelling involving the face, lips, hands, and trunk, along with hives on the abdomen and legs and associated dyspnea. The first episode occurred in autumn and the second episode the following summer. After the second episode, he lost consciousness while sitting on a bench. The next day, he was evaluated at an urgent care center. A Holter monitor was placed, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was reportedly normal. The patient consulted with an allergist, who made a diagnosis of food-related exercise-induced anaphylaxis with reactions to soybeans, chickpeas, and tahini, on the basis of the foods he had eaten before these episodes and the results of radioallergosorbent testing. An epinephrine autoinjector was prescribed for use during future episodes, but the anaphylaxis symptoms did not recur.\nApproximately 4 months before the current evaluation, during a routine 5-mile jog, the patient had a new sensation that he described as \u201cmy heart beating out of my chest.\u201d He rested, and the symptom subsided; he completed his run. One month later, during a bicycle ride, he had \u201ccrampy\u201d discomfort in the anterior chest, which abated when he stopped cycling. Two weeks before the current evaluation, during a jog of several miles, he had cramping pain in the anterior chest on the left side that gradually escalated over a 5-minute period. He started walking, and the pain abated; he ran for an additional 20 minutes without a recurrence of pain. He sought an evaluation in the cardiology clinic of this hospital to determine the cause of his symptoms and the safety of continued vigorous exercise.\nOn evaluation in the cardiology clinic, a review of systems was negative for dyspnea, recent syncope, orthopnea, edema, cough, hemoptysis, and recent allergic symptoms. The patient ran or cycled four times per week and had previously completed a marathon. His medical history included attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. Five years earlier, an episode of syncope had occurred in the context of multiple episodes of nonbloody diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and chills. His surgical history included two colonic polypectomies, one 6 years before this evaluation and the other 1 month before this evaluation; pathological examination of the polyps had revealed lymphoid aggregates and hyperplastic polyps. The patient took no medications and reported no adverse reactions to medications.\nThe patient worked in the financial sector and lived with his wife and children. He did not use tobacco, alcohol, or other substances. Multiple maternal relatives had had colon cancer, and an older brother had had colonic polyps removed in his fourth decade of life. There was a family history of hypertension.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 122/84 mm Hg (measured in both arms), the heart rate 54 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were mild expiratory wheezes; the remainder of the examination was normal.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities, findings that had been observed on tracings obtained 5 years earlier during an evaluation for presyncope; a TTE obtained at that time had been normal. Sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities had not been observed on tracings obtained 15 years earlier (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C). The white-cell count and platelet count were normal, as were blood levels of hemoglobin, electrolytes, calcium, and thyrotropin and results of renal-function tests. The high-sensitivity troponin level was 10 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14). Plasma metanephrines were undetectable, and the normetanephrine level was normal. The next day, a TTE showed no abnormalities of cardiac chamber size and function and no evidence of valvular dysfunction.\nFIGURE 1\n\nElectrocardiograms and Transthoracic Echocardiograms.\nAn ambulatory patch heart monitor, applied to evaluate cardiac rhythm over a 2-week period, revealed sinus rhythm without arrhythmia. A cardiopulmonary exercise stress test was performed; the patient exercised for 19 minutes 17 seconds according to a treadmill protocol that increased incrementally to maximal effort with a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.12 and a maximum heart rate of 181 beats per minute (99% of the age-predicted maximum). At peak effort, the stress test did not reproduce symptoms, and he stopped because of leg fatigue. An ECG showed 0.5-mm horizontal ST-segment depression in leads III, aVF, V3, and V6, along with isolated premature ventricular contractions. The ventilatory efficiency was normal.\nAdditional diagnostic testing was performed, and management decisions were made.",

Castle: A 70-year-old woman with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was evaluated in a clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, because of cough, shortness of breath, and malaise.\nFifteen years before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of HIV infection after she had presented with substantial weight loss and fatigue. The initial CD4 cell count obtained at the time of diagnosis was 29 cells per microliter (reference range, 332 to 1642). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) with stavudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz was started. During the subsequent year, the symptoms resolved, the HIV RNA level became undetectable, and the patient reported adherence to her medications. Ten years before the current presentation, additional ART became accessible within South Africa, and the ART regimen was changed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz.\nFive years before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to a local hospital because of diarrhea and diffuse myalgias, and she was found to have virologic failure. The ART regimen was changed to zidovudine, lamivudine, and lopinavir\u2013ritonavir. During the subsequent 4 years, the patient reported adherence to these medications without a lapse in treatment. The HIV RNA level ranged from 68 to 594,000 copies per milliliter of plasma (reference value, undetectable).\nTwelve months before the current presentation, the patient had new shortness of breath, cough, anorexia, and weight loss. During the subsequent 4 weeks, the symptoms progressively increased in severity. When the shortness of breath worsened to the extent that she was unable to walk, she sought evaluation at the clinic. The temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 104/64 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 16.9. On examination, the patient appeared ill but was able to speak in full sentences. Auscultation of the chest was limited because of frequent coughing; diffuse crackles were present in both lungs.\nNucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear of the sputum was positive for mycobacteria, and subsequent nucleic acid testing and culture of the sputum was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. In accordance with recommendations from the South African Department of Health, the patient was instructed to isolate at home and complete a course of treatment for tuberculosis, which included rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable,Reference Range,11 Mo before Current Presentation,4 Mo before Current Presentation,On Current Presentation\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201315.0, 9.6, \u2014, 7.6\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 29.3, \u2014, 24.5\nMean corpuscular volume (fl), 78.9\u201398.5, 97.7, \u2014, 99.6\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 186,000\u2013454,000, 146,000, \u2014, 104,000\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 3900\u201312,600, 1900, \u2014, 1960\n\nCD4 cell count:\nRelative count (%), 28.00\u201351.00, 0.87, \u2014, 2.31\nAbsolute count (per \u00b5l), 332\u20131642, 6, \u2014, 6\n\nHIV RNA (copies/ml of plasma), 0\u201320, \u2014, 151,000, 793\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), 0\u201310, 38, \u2014, 14\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201310, 122, \u2014, \u2014\nCryptococcal antigen, serum lateral flow assay, Negative, Negative, \u2014, \u2014\n\nDuring the subsequent 6 months, the patient took the antimycobacterial medications, and the shortness of breath and cough decreased but still persisted. Her weight decreased by 8 kg, even though the anorexia had resolved. Four months before the current presentation, new headaches and mouth ulcers developed, and the patient sought evaluation at the clinic. A sputum specimen was obtained for examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear and mycobacterial nucleic acid testing and culture, all of which were negative. The HIV RNA level was 151,000 copies per milliliter of plasma. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment.\nTwelve days before the current presentation, the patient presented to the clinic for follow-up, and the ART regimen was changed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. When the symptoms did not abate, the patient presented to the clinic for additional evaluation. She described persistent shortness of breath and dry cough, as well as headaches on the right side and mouth ulcers. The review of systems was notable for fatigue and weakness during the past 12 months, as well as fever, night sweats, chest pain, mouth ulcers, and odynophagia. She had no ageusia, anosmia, vision changes, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, or joint pain. Radiography of the chest had not been performed.\nThe patient had not received vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). She took tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolutegravir, as well as acetaminophen for muscle pain as needed. There were no known drug allergies. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs; she did not take any remedies from traditional healers. The patient lived with her daughter in a rural farming community in a coastal region of South Africa, and she had not traveled recently. She commuted by foot within her community and had regular exposure to cattle, goats, chickens, and dogs. Her household water supply originated from a borehole and was untreated.\nOn examination, the patient was alert but appeared ill and cachectic. She coughed throughout the interview. The blood pressure was 97/71 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. The body-mass index was 13.7. The mucous membranes were dry. She had thrush on the tongue, as well as superficial ulcers on the buccal mucosa. On auscultation of the chest, diffuse crackles were present in both lungs and were worst in the right lower lobe. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Meridale V. Baggett: One hundred years ago, a 24-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.1\nThe patient had been well until 3 days before this admission, when malaise, generalized weakness, headache, and back pain developed. During the next 2 days, his symptoms persisted, and he remained at home and slept in bed for most of the day. On the day before this admission, he began to have fever, dry cough, and chills that caused him to shake considerably and \u201chunched him up in a knot.\u201d He was unable to get out of bed. He took aspirin at a dose of 10 grains (648 mg) every 4 hours, which led to decreased severity of the headache and back pain. On the day of this admission, the patient awoke with difficulty breathing and chest pain just below the xiphoid process. The pain increased with deep breathing and coughing. He sought evaluation at this hospital.\nOn examination, the rectal temperature ranged from 39.5\u00b0C to 40.8\u00b0C, the heart rate from 92 to 145 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate from 28 to 58 breaths per minute. The patient appeared acutely ill and nervous. He was shivering despite being wrapped up in several blankets. His breathing was rapid, shallow, and labored. He had frequent paroxysms of racking cough, which caused excruciating pain under the lower sternum. The cough was productive of pinkish, thick, slightly purulent sputum.\nOn palpation, the apical impulse of the heart was felt in the fifth intercostal space, 8 cm to the left of the sternum along the midclavicular line. There was no enlargement of the heart on percussion. On auscultation, the heart sounds were rapid and regular, and there was a soft systolic murmur at the apex that did not radiate. The breath sounds were diminished at the right side of the back, from the lower third of the scapula downward, but had no definitive dullness or change in character. No evidence of rales or a friction rub was noted.\nThe throat was somewhat injected, and the tonsils had been surgically removed. A healed surgical scar was present on the left side of the abdomen, at the site of a previous hernia repair. The abdomen was not distended or tender. The skin was dry and hot to the touch. The white-cell count ranged from 3700 to 14,500 per microliter, with neutrophil predominance (79%). Blood cultures showed no growth.\nDr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: A posteroanterior chest radiograph (Figure 1) showed bilateral patchy consolidations, previously described as \u201cmottled dullness,\u201d that were most confluent in the right upper lobe and the left lower lobe. This finding is suggestive of pneumonia. There was also fullness in the left hilar region, which is suggestive of lymphadenopathy. The presence of a left pleural effusion cannot be ruled out.\nFIGURE 1\n\nChest Radiograph.\nDr. Kathy M. Tran: Adhesive plaster was applied to the patient\u2019s chest, and he was admitted to this hospital. On the second hospital day, the shortness of breath and chest pain on inspiration continued. The cough became productive of purulent sputum and blood. W.H. Smith performed a physical examination. The patient appeared very ill and held his abdominal muscles rigid while coughing. A systolic apical bruit was detected, along with dullness at the right lung base. Small hyperemic papules were seen on the left palm and the right index finger. Smith noted a \u201cserious outlook\u201d for the patient.\nOn the third hospital day, the sputum became much more purulent. On examination, increased dullness was noted on percussion of the left lower back. Increased tactile fremitus was also noted. Loud bronchial breath sounds and very few rales were heard at the left side of the back, from the lower third of the scapula downward. Slight dullness was present on percussion of the right lower back, and there were distant breath sounds and occasional medium rales.\nOn the fourth hospital day, the patient continued to be very ill. He gradually grew weaker, and that evening, he died.\nA diagnosis was made.",

Crabtree (Medicine): A 37-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, myalgia, jaundice, and hypoxemia.\nThe patient had been healthy until 9 days before this admission, when malaise, fatigue, and generalized weakness developed. The symptoms were severe, and he slept almost all day and night. Seven days before this admission, the patient had an oral temperature of 39.4\u00b0C, and headache developed, as well as achiness and stiffness in the arms, shoulders, knees, and legs. He was not able to eat a full meal because of decreased appetite and nausea. He did not have abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea.\nFive days before this admission, the fever and headache abated; however, the achiness increased, and the patient noticed that his urine was dark yellow. Three days before this admission, the patient sought evaluation in the urgent care clinic of another hospital. Testing was negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus types A and B. He was instructed to get adequate rest and hydration. Two days before this admission, the symptoms had not abated, and the patient returned to the urgent care clinic. On examination, new yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes was observed, and he was instructed to go to the emergency department of the other hospital.\nOn evaluation, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 106/70 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula, and boluses of intravenous fluids were given. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported exhaustion and shortness of breath but no cough, rhinorrhea, or congestion. He had no known medical conditions, took no medications, and had no known drug allergies. He lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with his partner, who had had an acute illness characterized by fever, malaise, nausea, and diarrhea that began 7 days before this admission and resolved after 4 days.\nThe patient worked in an office, and he took daily walks with his dog through the woods and along a river; he recalled receiving multiple insect bites during these walks. He reported no recent travel. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 16 years and used marijuana daily. He consumed two alcoholic drinks at a time, a few times per week, and he did not use illicit drugs.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/56 mm Hg, the pulse 103 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 42 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He was alert and oriented but appeared ill. He had increased work of breathing, with the use of accessory muscles of respiration; diffuse rales were heard in both lungs. There was no abdominal tenderness, hepatosplenomegaly, asterixis, or leg swelling. Marked scleral icterus and jaundiced skin were present, but he had no conjunctival suffusion, rash, or ulcers. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Ryan Chung: Radiography of the chest revealed bilateral, predominantly peripheral, patchy opacities (Figure 1A). Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed hyperechogenic and prominent portal triads with a \u201cstarry sky\u201d appearance; there was no biliary ductal dilatation or hydronephrosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities with tree-in-bud nodularity in both lungs (Figure 1B and 1C), as well as small pleural effusions and enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes (Figure 1D). No hepatic lesions, biliary ductal dilatation, or hepatosplenomegaly were noted (Figure 1E).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.\nDr. Crabtree: The patient started treatment with continuous positive airway pressure.

Patel: A 62-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of recurrent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 months before the current admission, when pleuritic pain and tightness in her chest developed suddenly while she was eating. The chest pain persisted and began to radiate to the neck and back. The symptoms did not abate with aspirin or acetaminophen. Within an hour after symptom onset, she noticed that the pain worsened with exertion and when she was in the supine position; she was also unable to take a full breath and had dizziness with exertion. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 104 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/91 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

A chest radiograph reportedly showed a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Intravenous heparin was administered. Four hours later, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed according to a pulmonary embolism protocol, reportedly ruled out pulmonary embolism; it also revealed a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with an attenuation level of 34 to 50 Hounsfield units, a mildly dilated ascending aorta (at a diameter of 37 mm; normal diameter, <36 mm on the basis of the patient\u2019s sex and body-surface area), and a pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe that measured 4 mm in diameter. Intravenous heparin was stopped, and protamine sulfate was administered. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of a second hospital 3 hours later.\nOn arrival at the second hospital, the temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/75 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. Pulsus paradoxus measured 16 mm Hg. The jugular venous pressure was 12 cm of water. Auscultation revealed tachycardia and a pericardial friction rub. The remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the level of troponin were normal. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia and right-axis deviation, with minor nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities.\nDr. Daniela R. Crousillat: A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a small-to-moderate circumferential pericardial effusion primarily abutting the right atrium and right ventricle with right atrial inversion and intermittent diastolic inversion of the right ventricle (Figure 1A). There was increased respiratory variation in the mitral inflow velocities and a dilated inferior vena cava with reduced respirophasic collapse; both these features were suggestive of the presence of physiologic characteristics of early tamponade (Figure 1B and Video 1). Colchicine and ibuprofen were administered, and the patient was admitted to the second hospital.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies Obtained before This Admission.\nDr. Patel: The next morning, pericardiocentesis was performed under fluoroscopic guidance with the use of a subxiphoid approach, and 200 ml of bloody fluid was drained; the intrapericardial pressure decreased from 12 mm Hg to 4 mm Hg. Analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed 4,700,000 erythrocytes per microliter and 12,010 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 78% were neutrophils, 13% monocytes, 8% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. Gram\u2019s staining revealed neutrophils and no organisms. The pericardial fluid albumin level was 3.0 g per deciliter, the total protein level 4.7 g per deciliter, the lactate dehydrogenase level 614 U per liter, the glucose level 71 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter), and the amylase level 31 U per liter.\nDr. Vinit Baliyan: On the second hospital day, a CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest showed a reduction in hemopericardium, and a pericardial drain was visible; there was no aortic dissection. There was an atrial septal occluder device in place that appeared to be in an appropriate position. The device appeared to be relatively large and abutted the aortic root anteriorly (Figure 1C). However, there was no evidence of erosion of the device into the aortic wall (known as device erosion) or pseudoaneurysm formation (Figure 1D).\nDr. Patel: On the third hospital day, no pericardial effusion was detected on TTE. Cytologic analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed reactive mesothelial cells, neutrophils, histiocytes, and eosinophils, with no malignant cells. The patient was discharged home with prescriptions for colchicine and ibuprofen.\nTen days after discharge from the second hospital, the patient had a follow-up visit with her cardiologist and reported that the chest pain and dyspnea had resolved. The heart rate was 94 beats per minute, the blood pressure 159/88 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the examination was normal. The antinuclear antibody titer was 1:160, with a homogeneous pattern, and a test for rheumatoid factor was negative. CT of the chest, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small-volume pericardial effusion, mild bronchial wall thickening, and a 4-mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe. Colchicine treatment was stopped.\nSix weeks before the current admission, the patient called her primary care physician to report recurrent back pain and dyspnea that she noted were similar to her previous presentation; treatment with colchicine was resumed. During the next 12 days, sinus pressure, myalgias, nasal congestion, and cough productive of green sputum developed, and she was seen by her primary care physician. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, the blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 94% while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. A screening test for respiratory viruses was negative. A chest radiograph reportedly showed clear lungs. Doxycycline was prescribed.\nFour days before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by her cardiologist at this hospital and reported ongoing cough and dyspnea. The heart rate was 87 beats per minute, and the blood pressure was 138/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nDr. Crousillat: A TTE showed recurrence of a moderate pericardial effusion, measuring up to 14 mm in end diastole, that was adjacent to the right ventricular free wall. There was evidence of right ventricular diastolic inversion that was suggestive of the physiologic characteristics of tamponade (Figure 2A and 2B). The patient was admitted to the cardiology floor of this hospital.\nFIGURE 2\n\nEchocardiograms Obtained on This Admission.\nDr. Patel: On evaluation, the patient reported that she had had episodes of dyspnea and cough with sputum production and a decrease in exercise tolerance in the weeks before this admission. She had no known sick contacts.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for postoperative pulmonary embolism, hypertension, dyslipidemia, recurrent episodes of syncope with cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses on tilt testing, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (for which she used a continuous positive airway pressure device), obesity, tubular adenomas (colonic polyps), hepatic steatosis, hiatal hernia, osteopenia, and cataracts. She also had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; on previous pulmonary-function testing, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 0.92 liters (39% of the predicted value), and the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity was 47%.\nFive and a half years before the current admission, the patient had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and abdominoplasty that had resulted in postoperative hemorrhage; she had lost 44 kg of weight after the sleeve gastrectomy. Fourteen years before this admission, the patient had undergone percutaneous transcatheter closure of a fenestrated atrial septal defect (ASD) with an interatrial septal aneurysm and a right-to-left shunt that was possibly related to recurrent transient ischemic attacks; the procedure had been performed with a 30-mm Amplatzer septal occluder device. She had had mammography and cervical cancer screening within the 16 months before this admission.\nMedications included colchicine, apixaban, losartan, theophylline, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, a multivitamin, and inhaled tiotropium and mometasone\u2013formoterol, as well as furosemide and albuterol as needed. Topiramate had caused paresthesia. The patient lived in Massachusetts with her husband and was a business owner. She had a 40-pack-year history of cigarette smoking and had quit smoking 10 years earlier; she did not drink alcohol or use other substances. Her family history was notable for coronary artery disease in her mother and father, stroke in her maternal grandmother and paternal grandfather, and seizure in a nephew.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the heart rate 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Pulsus paradoxus measured 10 mm Hg. The height was 163 cm and the weight 67 kg; the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.2. On examination, the jugular venous pressure was 10 cm of water. Auscultation revealed tachycardia, with no murmur or rub. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An ECG showed irregular tachycardia of uncertain underlying rhythm, low voltage in the limb leads, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and a rightward axis.\nDiagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",

Claudia Wu: A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital of the Chinese University of Hong Kong because of abdominal pain and diarrhea.\nThe patient had been well until 6 months before this admission, when colicky, diffuse abdominal pain developed. She also had nonbloody diarrhea that occurred up to 10 times daily. During the subsequent 6 months, the patient noticed decreased appetite and weight loss of 5 kg. The symptoms did not abate, and her family encouraged her to seek medical evaluation.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported gradually darkening skin on the face, arms, and legs, as well as hair thinning and changes in the appearance of all the fingernails and toenails during the previous 4 months. There was no nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, hematochezia, fevers, or night sweats.\nThe patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Ten months before this admission, she had sought evaluation by a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner because of irregular menses. She was given a \u201chomemade\u201d traditional Chinese medicine that contained unknown ingredients. The patient took the remedy for 4 months and stopped taking it when the abdominal pain and diarrhea developed 6 months before this admission. She did not take other medications and had no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband and son in an urban area of Hong Kong, and she did not work outside the home. She did not vape or smoke cigarettes, and she did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother and father were healthy; there was no family history of gastroenterologic, autoimmune, or hereditary diseases.\nOn evaluation, the temporal temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg, and the heart rate 85 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20. Examinations of the thyroid, heart, and lungs were normal. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Moderate pitting edema was observed in the lower legs, up to the mid-calf.\nDr. W.S. Agnes Chan: On dermatologic examination, the patient had patchy hair loss, with a large patch of alopecia at the vertex of the scalp; there was no scarring of the scalp (Figure 1A). A hair-pull test (in which 40 to 60 strands of closely grouped hair are gently pulled, with more than 10% of hairs pulled out indicating a positive result) was negative. There were symmetric brown macules over the lateral lower cheeks and malar regions of the face (Figure 1B and 1C), and hyperpigmentation and diffuse brown-gray macules were observed over the palms and the palmar aspects of the fingers (Figure 1D and 1E). Onychodystrophy was present on all the fingernails (Figure 1E) and toenails. There was onycholysis with distal separation of the nail plates from the nail beds, thinned nail plates, distal nail-plate crumbling, and onychomadesis with proximal separation of the nail plates from the nail matrices (Figure 1E and 1F).\nFIGURE 1\n\nPhotographs of the Scalp and Skin.\nDr. Wu: The blood level of hemoglobin was 10.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 11.9 to 15.1) with a low mean corpuscular volume. The white-cell count, C-reactive protein level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in blood were normal. The blood level of potassium was 2.9 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.5 to 5.0), ionized calcium 0.85 mmol per liter (reference range, 1.13 to 1.32), phosphate 0.52 mmol per liter (reference range, 0.72 to 1.43), and zinc 8.8 \u03bcmol per liter (reference range, 10.7 to 18.0). The blood level of albumin was 14 g per liter (reference range, 33 to 48). The protein level in a spot urine sample was normal. A stool culture showed normal enteric flora.

Castle: A 56-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in the spring of 2020, during the initial surge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic in Boston, because of fever, myalgias, diarrhea, and a dry cough.\nSix weeks before this admission, the patient had contact with a person with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. At that time, she did not have any symptoms compatible with Covid-19 and was not tested for SARS-CoV-2.\nFour weeks before this admission, in accordance with statewide recommendations from the Department of Public Health, the patient began isolating at home with her teenage son, working from home, and having groceries delivered. Two weeks before this admission, she and her son left home for a few hours to eat outdoors and spend time in a wooded area; they otherwise remained at home.\nSix days before this admission, fever, chills, and myalgias developed. The next day, watery diarrhea occurred. The patient\u2019s temperature measured at home was 38.3\u00b0C; fever persisted despite the intermittent administration of acetaminophen. Three days before this admission, a frontal headache developed, along with a dry cough that was associated with a self-limited episode of chest pain. The patient\u2019s son had had no symptoms, except for a self-limited episode of diarrhea 2 weeks before the patient\u2019s symptoms developed. On the day of admission, the patient continued to have fever, so she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing myalgias, headache, and cough. There was no nausea, vomiting, rash, shortness of breath, or anosmia. She had no notable medical history and took no medications. She was allergic to amoxicillin, with an unknown reaction. She did not smoke tobacco and drank alcohol rarely; she did not use illicit drugs. The patient lived in an urban area of New England and had traveled to Canada 6 months before this admission.

Memel (Medicine): A 60-year-old man presented to this hospital because of fevers, fatigue, arthralgias, a mouth ulcer, and a rash.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 month before the current presentation, when sore throat, fever, and fatigue developed while he was visiting relatives in the Southwest region of the United States. The symptoms persisted despite regular use of acetaminophen. Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a local hospital in the Southwest, where a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reportedly negative. Oral amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid and doxycycline were prescribed, and the patient was discharged home.\nTen days before the current presentation, a tongue ulcer developed, along with dry scaly nodules on the face and hands and migratory arthralgias in the wrists, fingers, elbows, and shoulders. Because of worsening symptoms, the patient returned home to Boston by airplane. When he landed in Boston, the patient felt too weak to stand, and an ambulance was called to transport him to this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing fevers, fatigue, arthralgias, and sore throat. He had lost 4.5 kg over a 1-month period. He had no eye redness or pain, genital ulcers, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or headache. There was no notable medical history, and the patient had not been taking any regular medications before this illness. He had completed a course of oral amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid and doxycycline the day before presentation, and he had been taking acetaminophen for the past month. There were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient was born in China and had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier. He lived with his wife in Boston. He had not traveled internationally for more than 10 years. The patient had previously worked in environmental maintenance but was retired. He had no history of exposure to animals or fresh water and no sick contacts. He had not been sexually active for several years. He was a smoker with a 30-pack-year history, and he drank alcohol socially; there was no injection-drug use. His family history included colon cancer in his father, lung cancer in his mother, pancreatic cancer in his sister, and hepatocellular carcinoma in his brother.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 118/69 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 59 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 19.2. The patient appeared unwell. There was no conjunctival injection. Oral mucous membranes were dry. There was a circular shallow ulcer on the lateral aspect of the tongue on the left side, as well as white plaque on the dorsal aspect of the tongue. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly. Strength was 4/5 in both shoulders. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. There were several small scaly nodules with a rim of patchy erythema on the fingers, an erosion with serosanguineous crust on the left elbow, and two erythematous and mildly violaceous nodules on the forehead (Figure 1).

Similar findings were observed on histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen of the elbow lesion.\nDr. Memel: Cough developed, and pain in the left shoulder increased. On the fifth hospital day, the creatine kinase level was 906 U per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The next day, imaging studies of the left shoulder were obtained.\nDr. Rodriguez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left shoulder, performed on hospital day 6, revealed patchy mild intramuscular edema that was most pronounced in the trapezius and deltoid, a finding compatible with myositis (Figure 2). There was no focal or organized fluid collection.\nDr. Memel: On hospital day 10, biopsy of the left deltoid was performed with the patient under general anesthesia. In the 24 hours after the muscle biopsy, hypoxemia developed, and the patient received 3 liters of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of more than 93%. The next day, the patient received 8 liters of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies of the chest were obtained.\nDr. Rodriguez: Repeat chest radiography revealed progressive patchy opacities at the lung bases. Repeat CT of the chest revealed progressive peribronchovascular and peripheral ground-glass and consolidative opacities predominantly involving the lower lobes, a finding consistent with organizing pneumonia (Figure 2). In addition, new small left and trace right pleural effusions were present.\nDr. Memel: A diagnostic test was performed.",

Shenoy: A 20-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of a diffuse pustular rash that had progressed over a period of several days.\nThree days before the current evaluation, the patient noticed a pustular rash on the left forearm that stung while he was taking a shower. He was a student athlete and was evaluated by an athletic trainer, who referred him to the student health clinic. The next day, the rash had progressed to involve the right arm. He received prescriptions for oral trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and topical mupirocin.\nThe day before the current evaluation, the patient noticed an increased number of lesions, including new lesions on the chest, face, and ears. He consulted his primary care physician, who referred him to a dermatologist. The patient was unable to schedule a dermatology office visit, and the next day, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported that, despite topical and oral antimicrobial therapy, the rash had progressed and was very pruritic. He also stated that several days before the current evaluation, he had had close contact with another man with a similar rash. On a review of systems, he reported no fever, chills, night sweats, myalgia, cough, rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or neurologic symptoms.\nMedical history was notable for oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, allergic rhinitis, patellar tendinosis, and tonsillectomy. Three years before the current evaluation, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection involving the right arm had been treated with topical antibiotic agents. Current medications included oral trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and loratadine and inhaled albuterol as needed. He had no known drug allergies. He had received two vaccinations against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but had not received the vaccine against mpox because he had no risk factors for infection. There was no family history of infectious, dermatologic, rheumatologic, or oncologic conditions. The patient was a college student and lived in a dormitory on campus; he was on the college\u2019s wrestling team. Previously, he had lived in a town in coastal Massachusetts but reported no other travel. He had a pet dog, but there were no other animal exposures. He was sexually active with women. He had a history of vaping but did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit substances.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/74 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was muscular; the weight was 77 kg. He had dozens of grouped, raised vesiculopustular lesions with erythematous bases at various stages of development; some of the lesions were more pustular, some were umbilicated, and others had a scab or eschar. Some areas of confluence were present. Lesions were found on the antecubital fossae, cheeks, and torso; similar lesions were scattered on the back, left axilla, lower right abdomen, calves, occiput, and posterior to the ears (Figure 1). There was erythema in intertriginous areas. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, albumin, globulin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

    "user_input": "Dr. Jamie Aron (Emergency Medicine): A 27-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of leg weakness.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 days before the current presentation, when myalgias developed in the upper legs. He initially attributed the pain to increased physical activity while at work in construction. When he awoke on the morning of the current presentation, he could not lift his legs to move in bed or to stand up. He also had weakness in the arms, although it was less pronounced than the weakness in the legs. He asked his family to bring him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing weakness. He had no history of trauma, back pain, or saddle anesthesia. There were no changes in sensation. He had no other relevant medical history, and he took no prescribed medications. He had moved to Boston from El Salvador 5 months before the current presentation.\nAfter arriving in Boston, the patient had begun to have increasing difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep, which he had attributed to stress. He had had loose stools but a normal appetite and was eating normally with no abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting; he estimated a weight loss of approximately 5 kg since moving to Boston. In addition, he reported that he had had trembling in his hands for several months before the current presentation, which he had also attributed to stress. Four days before the current presentation, he began taking an herbal supplement (sold under the brand name Nervitran) that was intended to reduce stress. He had no known allergies. He drank alcohol occasionally, had never smoked tobacco, and did not use illicit drugs. There was no family history of hypertension or liver disease; a maternal aunt had had an episode of weakness, but the patient was not aware of a diagnosis.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 144/79 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. Conjunctival injection was present in both eyes. Muscle strength was 4/5 on abduction of both shoulders and on flexion and extension of the elbows, wrists, and fingers. Muscle strength was 5/5 on knee flexion and extension and 3/5 on hip flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion. Sensation to light touch and temperature was normal. Patellar reflexes were 3+. There was a low-amplitude, high-frequency fine tremor in the hands, which was more prominent in the left hand than in the right hand. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe complete blood count was normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation. A blood toxicology screen was negative for salicylates, acetaminophen, ethanol, and tricyclic antidepressant medications. The blood level of aspartate aminotransferase was 56 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), the alanine aminotransferase level 65 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the alkaline phosphatase level 137 U per liter (reference range, 45 to 115), the total bilirubin level 1.3 mg per deciliter (22 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.0 to 1.0 mg per deciliter [0 to 17 \u03bcmol per liter]), the potassium level 1.8 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.0), the creatine kinase level 382 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400), and the aldolase level 9.9 U per liter (reference value, <7.7); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A urinalysis was not performed. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, incomplete right bundle-branch block, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Potassium chloride was administered orally at a dose of 60 meq.

Raju (Pediatrics): A 9-year-old boy was transferred to this hospital because of transient weakness and facial droop on the left side and slurred speech.\nThe patient had been well until 5 hours before this evaluation, when his parents observed that he had a facial droop on the left side and slurred speech. In addition, the patient noticed that his left arm and leg felt \u201climp.\u201d When he moved to get out of his bed, he could not stand on his own or grip using the left hand. There was no confusion, loss of consciousness, shaking in the arms or legs, urinary or fecal incontinence, headache, nausea, vomiting, recent illness, or trauma. The symptoms lasted approximately 2 minutes and then resolved completely. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital.\nAt the other hospital, the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and troponin were normal, as were the results of tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. Earlier in the day, the patient had become upset while visiting his grandfather, who was dying of esophageal cancer. He then played a game of hockey with a sibling; no falls or head trauma occurred. At the time that his parents observed the new neurologic symptoms, he had been lying in bed and crying profusely and inconsolably for an extended period. His parents noticed that he was gasping for air and hiccupping while crying.\nThe patient had been born by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at full term. He had met normal developmental milestones and had received routine childhood vaccinations. He had chronic gastrointestinal upset that had been attributed to anxiety. Two years earlier, he had been evaluated at the neurology clinic of another hospital because of episodes of shaking in the arms and legs, which occurred multiple times a day. The shaking occurred more frequently when the patient was excited or emotional. He was aware of the shaking; he felt an urge before each episode, and the urge was relieved after the shaking occurred. His parents were told that the shaking was stereotypy, and no diagnostic tests were performed.\nThe patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He lived with his parents and two siblings in a suburban area of New England. He attended elementary school and performed well academically, although he received tutoring for mild difficulties with reading and phonology. In addition to the history of esophageal cancer in his paternal grandfather, his father had ulcerative colitis, his mother had received a diagnosis of large-B-cell lymphoma in childhood, his sister had asthma, and his maternal grandfather had died of acute coronary syndrome at 30 years of age.\nOn evaluation, the patient appeared well developed and mildly anxious. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/64 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The face was symmetric, with normal forehead wrinkling, blinking, smiling, and cheek puffing. An evaluation of other cranial-nerve functions, sensation, power, bulk, tone, coordination, and gait was normal.\nA diagnostic test result was reviewed, and a diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Kevin S. Oh (Radiation Oncology): A 45-year-old woman was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital because of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.\nThe patient had been well until 6 years before the current presentation, when she noticed a mass in the right breast. She was evaluated in the oncology clinic of another hospital, and mammography and ultrasonography of the right breast confirmed the presence of a mass. A core-needle biopsy was performed, and pathological examination of the specimen revealed invasive ductal carcinoma with no lymphovascular invasion. Lumpectomy of the right breast, along with sentinel-node biopsy of the right axilla, was performed.\nDr. Baris Boyraz: Pathological examination of the specimen that was obtained by means of lumpectomy confirmed the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient\u2019s tumor was grade 3 (measuring 2.5 cm in diameter), negative for estrogen receptor, weakly positive (<5% of tumor cells) for progesterone receptor, and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), findings consistent with a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer. Three sentinel lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma, and there was no lymphovascular invasion. Genetic testing revealed no pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.\nDr. Oh: The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, followed by radiation therapy to the right breast. During the subsequent 3.5 years, surveillance imaging showed no evidence of disease recurrence.\nEighteen months before the current presentation, weakness and numbness developed in the left arm and resolved spontaneously after 15 minutes. During the subsequent 4 weeks, the patient had similar episodes of left-arm weakness and numbness, which occurred 1 or 2 times per week. When the episodes did not abate, she sought evaluation in the emergency department of the other hospital. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Karen Rodriguez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a partially cystic mass in the right precentral gyrus. The mass measured 3.5 cm in diameter, with peripheral enhancement and local mass effect.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Head and Chest.\nDr. Oh: The patient was transferred to this hospital for neurosurgical management. The episodes of arm weakness and numbness were attributed to seizures; treatment with dexamethasone and levetiracetam was started. Right frontal craniotomy was performed, and the mass was resected.\nDr. Boyraz: Pathological examination of tissue obtained from the resected mass (Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C) revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive mitotic and apoptotic activity. The tumor cells had patchy positivity for GATA-3, a transcription factor expressed by breast tissue, which supported a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma originating in the breast. Further studies revealed the tumor to be estrogen-receptor\u2013negative and progesterone-receptor\u2013negative, with a HER2 score on immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of 1+ (incomplete, faint membrane staining in >10% of tumor cells), and programmed death ligand 1 expression of less than 1%, findings that are consistent with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Next-generation sequencing revealed variants in FOXL2, CCND3, TP53, and FLT3. An RNA fusion assay did not show fusion transcripts.\nFIGURE 2\n\nBiopsy Specimens of the Brain Mass and Lung.\nDr. Rodriguez: Positron-emission tomography\u2013computed tomography (PET-CT) (Figure 1B and 1C), performed after the administration of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, showed a conglomerate lymph-node mass in the right perihilar region with intense FDG avidity.\nDr. Oh: After surgery, the patient had an uneventful recovery, and the episodes of weakness and numbness resolved. She was discharged home with planned follow-up in the oncology clinic. Radiation therapy was administered to the brain, and treatment with capecitabine was initiated. However, 11 months before the current presentation, the episodes recurred. The dose of levetiracetam was increased, and additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Rodriguez: MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple new enhancing lesions with features consistent with metastasis, including a lesion in the right occipital lobe that measured 3 mm in diameter. Postsurgical changes related to the craniotomy on the right side and the resection of the mass in the right precentral gyrus were also present.\nDr. Oh: Stereotactic radiosurgery to the right occipital metastasis was performed.\nDr. Rodriguez: Seven months before the current presentation, PET-CT, performed after the administration of FDG tracer, showed an increase in the size of the right perihilar mass with intense FDG avidity, as well as new FDG avidity in a right lower paratracheal lymph node.\nDr. Oh: Treatment with capecitabine was discontinued. The patient was enrolled in a clinical trial, and treatment with oral paclitaxel was initiated (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03326102).\nDr. Rodriguez: Five months before the current presentation, MRI of the head revealed a new enhancing lesion in the right superior frontal gyrus, measuring 7 mm in diameter. The right occipital lesion was not seen.\nDr. Oh: The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to the right frontal metastasis. During the subsequent 5 months, treatment with oral paclitaxel was continued.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, nonproductive cough developed. There was no shortness of breath, orthopnea, or chest pain. The patient had not had additional episodes of weakness and numbness in the left arm, and no headache or vision changes had occurred.\nOther medical history included depression. Medications included oral paclitaxel, levetiracetam, paroxetine, prochlorperazine as needed for nausea, lorazepam as needed for anxiety, and acetaminophen as needed for musculoskeletal pain. Penicillin had caused rash. The patient was a teacher and lived with her husband and two children in a rural area of New England. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her maternal grandmother had died of leukemia, and her paternal grandfather had died of prostate cancer.\nAt the current presentation, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/73 mm Hg, the heart rate 67 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were well-healed craniotomy and lumpectomy scars. The breasts had no skin changes, masses, or tenderness. There was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was normal. The complete blood count and the results of kidney-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, and globulin. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Rodriguez: MRI of the head revealed a new peripherally enhancing lesion in the left precentral gyrus, measuring 6 mm in diameter, as well as a new enhancing lesion in the right superior frontal gyrus, measuring 1 mm in diameter. Full-body PET-CT, performed after the administration of FDG tracer, showed enlargement of the conglomerate lymph-node mass in the right perihilar region, which was encasing the bronchus of the right upper lobe and occluding the bronchus of the right middle lobe. In addition, there was severe narrowing of the right superior pulmonary vein.\nDr. Oh: Treatment with oral paclitaxel was stopped, and the patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to the metastasis involving the left frontal lobe.\nManagement decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Jacquelyn M. Nestor (Medicine): A 41-year-old woman with transient dysarthria and facial droop was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of masses on the mitral valve.\nThree weeks before this presentation, the patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital because of concerns about heavy vaginal bleeding that had developed 1 week earlier and was associated with crampy abdominal pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and lightheadedness. Examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/79 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 100% while she was breathing ambient air; the examination was otherwise reportedly normal, although a gynecologic examination was not performed. Laboratory results were notable for a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0; previous level 1 year earlier, 9.1), a mean corpuscular volume of 71.3 fl (reference range, 80 to 94), and a platelet count of 148,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Normal saline was administered intravenously, and a 5-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed.\nEleven days after the patient completed the therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate (9 days before this presentation), heavy vaginal bleeding and dyspnea recurred. An additional 3-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed. The evening after the patient finished the second course of treatment, within 1 hour after she had been seen and had appeared to be well, her husband noted that she had facial droop on the right side and slurred speech; he called emergency medical services. When she arrived at the emergency department of a second hospital, within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms, her examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 173/83 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 99% while she was breathing ambient air. She was noted to have facial droop on the right side and unintelligible speech.\nDr. Sandra P. Rincon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Figure 1A) revealed no evidence of acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage. Small chronic infarcts were seen in the right thalamus and right cerebellar hemisphere. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck did not show high-grade stenosis or large-vessel occlusion.\nFIGURE 1\n\nNeuroimaging Studies.\nDr. Nestor: A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. Blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the white-cell count and differential count and the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable, and urinalysis showed 3+ blood, no protein, and no casts. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Within 45 minutes after the patient arrived at the emergency department of the second hospital, the facial asymmetry and dysarthria resolved. The patient was admitted to the medical unit of the second hospital.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults, Second Hospital), On Initial Presentation (Second Hospital), Second Day (Second Hospital), Fourth Day (Second Hospital), Reference Range (Adults, This Hospital), On Initial Presentation (This Hospital)\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201315.9, 6.7, 8.5, 9.2, 12.0\u201316.0, 8.4\nHematocrit (%), 34.9\u201344.5, 20.3, 25.3, 27.4, 36.0\u201346.0, 26.6\nMean corpuscular volume (fl), 80\u2013100, 64.1, 67.1, 68.2, 80.0\u2013100.0, 71.9\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4000\u201311,000, 5320, 5160, 6680, 4500\u201311,000, 5800\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 135,000\u2013400,000, 168,000, 156,000, 172,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 151,000\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, \u2014, 14.4, 13.4, 11.5\u201314.5, \u2014\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, \u2014, 1.1, 1.2, 0.9\u20131.1, \u2014\nPartial-thromboplastin time (sec), 22.0\u201336.0, \u2014, 39.0, >150.0, 22.0\u201336.0, \u2014\nFibrinogen (mg/dl), 200\u2013400, \u2014, \u2014, 311, \u2014, \u2014\nD-dimer (ng/ml), <500, \u2014, \u2014, 566, \u2014, \u2014\nAnti\u2013factor Xa (IU/ml), Not detected, Not detected, \u2014, \u2014, <0.71, 0.13\nHigh-sensitivity troponin T (ng/liter), 0\u20139, \u2014, 12, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201320, \u2014, 48, \u2014, 0\u201313, \u2014\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), 0.0\u20138.0, \u2014, 6.1, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nCA-125 (U/ml), 0\u201335, \u2014, 14, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nCarcinoembryonic antigen (ng/ml), <5.3, \u2014, 1.5, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nIron (\u00b5g/dl), 50\u2013170, \u2014, 68, \u2014, 30\u2013160, \u2014\nTotal iron-binding capacity (\u00b5g/dl), 250\u2013450, \u2014, 427, \u2014, 230\u2013404, \u2014\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), 10\u2013291, \u2014, 13, \u2014, 10\u2013200, \u2014\n\nDr. Rincon: The next day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography of the head and neck again revealed old lacunar infarcts in the right thalamus (Figure 1B) and right cerebellar hemisphere (Figure 1C). There was no evidence of an acute infarction (Figure 1D), intracranial hemorrhage, or cerebrovascular occlusion (Figure 1E and 1F).\nDr. Nestor: Two units of packed red cells were transfused. Post-transfusion laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 2A and 2B and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) showed thickened mitral valve leaflets and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg.\nFIGURE 2\n\nEchocardiograms and CT Scans of the Abdomen and Pelvis.\nDr. Evin Yucel: On the third hospital day, a transesophageal echocardiogram (Figure 2C and Videos 2 and 3) showed multiple echodensities on the atrial side of the mitral valve leaflets at the closure lines that were consistent with vegetations. Cultures of blood were obtained, and heparin was administered intravenously.\nDr. Nestor: On the fourth hospital day, the rate of heparin infusion was decreased at 6-hour intervals when the partial-thromboplastin time exceeded 150 seconds, until the infusion was stopped. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1; complement levels (C3 and C4) were normal. Additional cultures of blood were obtained.\nDr. Rincon: Repeat CT of the head revealed no acute abnormality. CT of the chest showed clustered nodules in the lower lobes that were probably related to aspiration, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2D, 2E, and 2F) revealed an enlarged heterogeneous uterus with multiple fibroids.\nDr. Nestor: The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On a review of systems, she reported no recurrence of dysarthria or facial droop and noted no other neurologic symptoms. She reported that she had had heavy menstrual bleeding and exertional dyspnea in the weeks preceding this presentation; pruritic, macular rashes on the trunk, scalp, arms, and legs with associated photosensitivity that had persisted for many weeks; new Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon in the past 10 months; and a long history of dry eyes and seasonal allergies. Medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, vitamin B12 deficiency, iron deficiency resulting in past iron infusions, uterine fibroids, anxiety, and hypertension. Surgical history included multiple laparoscopies and two laparotomies, including salpingo-oophorectomy for endometriosis. Owing to infertility, she had undergone in vitro fertilization; she had a first-trimester spontaneous abortion at 25 years of age. During her second pregnancy at 33 years of age, a screening rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was positive at 1:8; however, a treponemal-specific confirmatory test for syphilis was negative. Pregnancy-induced hypertension developed, followed by placental abruption at 30 weeks, which resulted in a cesarean delivery. Medications included amlodipine, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, and medroxyprogesterone acetate. She had no known medication allergies.\nThe patient lived in eastern Massachusetts with her husband and child. She did not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. Her mother had rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and a history of spontaneous abortion. One grandmother had diabetes and the other grandmother had had a stroke. An aunt had had leukemia and later breast cancer. Her child has psoriasis.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 155/98 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 175 cm, the weight 107 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 34.9. There were several small, circular macules on her back (Figure 3). There was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex. She had no lymphadenopathy, petechiae, nail changes, or evidence of arthritis. The remainder of the examination was normal, as was a neurologic examination.\nFIGURE 3\n\nClinical Photograph of Macules on the Back.\nLaboratory test results are shown in Table 1. All the blood cultures obtained at the second hospital showed no growth. An electrocardiogram was normal.\nDiagnostic test results were received, and management decisions were made.",

Materne (Pediatrics): A 12-month-old boy with Hirschsprung\u2019s disease was admitted to this hospital because of fever.\nFifteen days before the current admission, the patient had a temperature of 39.7\u00b0C. His parents noticed that he was fussy and less active than usual and that he had a decreased appetite along with several episodes of \u201cspitting up\u201d; there was no vomiting or diarrhea. During the next 5 days, fever occurred daily and abated with the administration of acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Ten days before the current admission, a bowel movement with watery, nonbloody, foul-smelling, mustard-yellow stool occurred. The patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the patient was irritable. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There were well-circumscribed, erythematous, edematous plaques on the abdomen, legs, feet, and forearms. The alanine aminotransferase level was 131 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the aspartate aminotransferase level 250 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 80), the ferritin level 3826 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 30 to 300), and the d-dimer level 3218 ng per milliliter (reference range, <500). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 40 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 15); the white-cell count was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A radiograph of the abdomen showed gas-filled loops of bowel. The rectum was irrigated, and intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered. On the third hospital day, the patient was afebrile and able to take formula, and the diarrhea abated.

However, 4 days before the current admission, a day-care worker observed that the patient appeared tired. During the subsequent 3 days at home, fever again developed, with chills and a decreased appetite. The day before the current admission, the patient cried through the night. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nThe parents reported that the patient was fussy and had poor sleep and generalized weakness; there was no diarrhea or new rash. The parents did not think that the patient was in pain. Additional history was obtained from the parents. The patient had met developmental milestones until 1 month earlier, when he had stopped crawling. He had previously been able to pull his body into a standing position, but he no longer attempted this maneuver. If he was placed in a standing position, he collapsed; if he was placed in a sitting position, he was able to stay upright. He had previously passed objects from hand to hand, but he had a new preference of holding objects with the left hand. Two days before this evaluation, the parents had noticed that the patient no longer walked with support; he seemed to dislike having his hands held.\nThe patient had cornea plana and a history of Hirschsprung\u2019s disease, for which he had undergone laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and an anal pull-through procedure at 2 months of age. Four months before the current evaluation, an intermittent diffuse rash on the trunk, arms, and legs had developed. The rash was characterized by purplish and pinkish plaques that appeared and varied in intensity of color throughout the day; it did not seem to be itchy or painful and usually resolved within 24 hours without treatment.\nImmunizations were up to date. Medications included metronidazole, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and cetirizine, as well as carboxymethylcellulose eye drops; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient lived with his mother, father, and pet dog in a small town in New England, and he attended day care 5 days per week. His mother was healthy, and his father had irritable bowel syndrome and Poland syndrome (congenital aplasia of unilateral chest-wall muscles). His paternal grandmother had hypothyroidism, his maternal great-grandfather had had pancreatic cancer, his paternal great-grandfather had had breast cancer, a maternal second cousin had autism, and multiple maternal family members had Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 113/52 mm Hg, the heart rate 166 beats per minute (normal range for age, 80 to 160), and the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute (normal range for age, 30 to 60). The patient was diaphoretic and irritable, and he cried during the examination. He had rhinorrhea. The abdomen was not distended or tender. There was limited extension of the wrists and knees, as well as limited inversion and eversion of the feet. The ankles were mildly stiff, and the feet were mildly swollen. There were erythematous plaques on the abdomen, back, arms, and legs (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs.\nThe ferritin and d-dimer levels remained elevated, and the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 75 mm per hour, the white-cell count 26,820 per microliter (reference range, 6000 to 17,500), and the platelet count 682,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood cultures and urinalysis were normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Randheer Shailam: A radiograph of the chest and abdomen was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed cholelithiasis and prominent lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed a small amount of joint fluid in the hips and knees (Figure 2); the amount of fluid appeared to be within the normal range. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder, without gallbladder distention. There were a few prominent lymph nodes in the paraaortic, iliac, and inguinal regions (Figure 2). Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal coronary arteries.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Materne: The empirical administration of intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was begun. During the next 3 days, the fever continued and the white-cell count remained elevated. On the seventh hospital day, the fever, leukocytosis, and elevation in levels of inflammatory markers persisted. The administration of antibiotic agents was stopped.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Claudio M. de Gusmao: A 69-year-old man was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of progressively worsening ataxia.\nThe patient had been well until 9 years before this evaluation, when abnormal gait and impaired coordination developed. He was unable to walk in a straight line; he bumped into walls when walking down a hallway. He also had difficulty reading traffic signs while driving and noted a change in the quality of his voice. The patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of another hospital and began physical therapy.\nDuring the next several years, symptoms gradually worsened despite physical therapy. The patient was no longer able to drive or play golf, and he intermittently used a walker because of unsteadiness. He had frequent falls, including one that led to fractures in six ribs. His speech changes worsened, such that he could no longer sing. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the neurology clinic, the patient reported frequent bowel movements, approximately 10 per day. He had no vertigo, lightheadedness, hearing loss, tremor, erectile dysfunction, disturbance of sleep, or urinary incontinence. He reported a sense of visual disorientation with head movement and with changes in the direction of gaze. He had a history of hyperlipidemia. Medications included atorvastatin, cetirizine, and a multivitamin; there were no known drug allergies. The patient had recently moved from an urban area in the southeastern United States to a suburban area of New England. He drank one glass of wine nightly; additional alcohol use caused worsening of ataxia and dysarthria. He had previously smoked five cigarettes daily but had quit smoking 30 years before this evaluation; he did not use illicit drugs.\nThe patient\u2019s mother had died of heart failure at an elderly age, and his father had died after a stroke and myocardial infarction at 70 years of age. The patient had two adult children, who were healthy. His two brothers and one of his sisters had celiac disease; the sister also reportedly had a shuffling gait. The sister\u2019s daughter had received a diagnosis of Turner\u2019s syndrome and had been seen by a neurologist for a balance disturbance. A brother\u2019s grandson also had celiac disease and a gait disturbance (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nFamily History.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg, and the pulse 72 beats per minute. The patient was alert, oriented, and attentive and provided a detailed history. He had moderate dysarthria, with impairment in the rate, rhythm, and clarity of speech. An oculomotor examination revealed complete and conjugate gaze in all directions; he had intact smooth pursuit movements but had slow, dysmetric saccades. Results of a head impulse test were abnormal, with corrective saccades noted bilaterally. Normal tone and full strength were present in all major muscle groups of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric at the knees but absent at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Rapid tapping of the index fingers on the thumbs was dysrhythmic and uncoordinated. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing revealed mild intention tremor. Heel-to-shin testing revealed symmetric jerking movements with lateral movements across the shins. Vibration and joint-position senses in the legs were profoundly decreased: the patient was unable to sense vibration at the toes, had a decreased ability to sense vibration at the knees, and had difficulty discerning the position of his big toe with his eyes closed. There was sway in his stance, regardless of whether his eyes were open, and he could not stand with the feet together. The patient walked without support. He had a wide-based gait with considerable staggering and jerky, stiff movements of the legs. He was unable to maintain balance in a tandem stance or to walk with a tandem gait.\nThe complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were test results for kidney, liver, and thyroid function; antibodies to thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin were not detected. Blood levels of cyanocobalamin, methylmalonic acid, vitamin E, and glycated hemoglobin were normal; anti\u2013glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were not detected. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Genetic testing revealed no mutations in genes associated with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8. Clinical testing of otolith function revealed abnormal vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials on the left side. Nerve-conduction studies revealed absent or barely detectable responses in the bilateral sural nerves, left superficial peroneal nerve, left median nerve, left ulnar nerve, and right radial nerve. Results of motor nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were results of a modified barium-swallow evaluation. A previous workup at another hospital for chronic diarrhea had reportedly been normal, with no evidence of malabsorption.\nDr. McKinley Glover: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss and prominent cerebellar volume loss, most notably involving the vermis and superior cerebellar hemispheres. There was mild flattening of the superior margin of the midbrain, and the ratio of midbrain to ventral pons was mildly reduced at 0.51 (reference range, >0.52).1 The anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain was 8.90 mm (reference range, >9.35).1 There was no abnormal signal in the pons, and the middle cerebellar peduncles were normal. There was a chronic lacunar infarct of the right thalamus.\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. de Gusmao: Additional history was obtained, and a diagnosis was made.",

Akusobi (Medicine): A 44-year-old woman was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of proximal muscle weakness and myalgia.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 years before the current presentation, when morning stiffness and pain developed in the small joints of both hands. Laboratory evaluation reportedly revealed elevated blood levels of anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies and rheumatoid factor, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed, but the patient chose not to begin specific therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Instead, she began taking selenium, cod-liver oil, and turmeric as home remedies for joint pain. Morning stiffness and joint pain resolved after 4 weeks.\nFour years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was started after the occurrence of another episode of morning stiffness and pain in the small joints of the hands. Three years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was stopped after melasma developed. Treatment with methotrexate was initiated, but morning hand stiffness and pain recurred; methotrexate was replaced with leflunomide, and the symptoms in the hands subsequently decreased.\nSix months before the current presentation, the patient began to have myalgia in the arms and thighs, as well as generalized fatigue. She had difficulty raising her arms above her head, and she could no longer independently brush her hair or apply makeup. Myalgia worsened with exercise and was worst at the end of the day. The patient reported episodes of tingling in the hands and feet, but she had no stiffness or pain in the small joints of her hands.\nThree months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a local rheumatologist and laboratory testing was performed. The blood level of creatine kinase was 422 U per liter (reference range, 40 to 150) and the lactate dehydrogenase level 509 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected at a titer of 1:320 in a nuclear homogenous pattern, and anti\u2013U1-ribonucleoprotein (U1-RNP) antibodies were present. The blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal, and testing for anti\u2013double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and anti-Smith antibodies was negative. Two months before the current presentation, treatment with azathioprine was started, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported ongoing myalgia and tingling in the hands and feet but had noticed an improvement in her ability to raise her arms above her head after starting treatment with azathioprine. Two weeks earlier, episodes of muscle spasms in the hands and fingers had developed; massage of the hands had been performed to relax the spasms.\nThe patient had a history of Graves\u2019 disease, which had been complicated by ophthalmoplegia and had been treated with methimazole for 2 years, followed by radioactive iodine ablation 11 years before this presentation; hypothyroidism had developed after radioactive iodine ablation therapy. Other history included latent tuberculosis infection, which had been treated with a 3-month course of isoniazid and rifampin, and hypoparathyroidism that had developed 9 years before this presentation. Medications included azathioprine, levothyroxine, calcium supplements, and calcitriol; the patient was unsure of the formulation and dose of calcium supplementation. She lived outside the United States and traveled intermittently to Boston for specialized medical care. She lived with her mother and worked in information technology. She drank alcohol occasionally, smoked cigarettes, and used no illicit drugs. A sibling had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 145/70 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She had mild exophthalmos in both eyes. There was an area of hyperpigmentation on the face. The joints had a normal range of motion without tenderness on palpation; there was no synovitis. Neck flexion was mildly weak, as was hip flexion; strength was otherwise normal, as was sensation. There was no rash. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nDiagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Sahar Shahamatdar (Medicine): A 59-year-old woman was referred to the multidisciplinary breast oncology clinic of this hospital for evaluation of a long-standing breast lesion.\nThe patient had had limited medical care since she was 34 years of age. Three weeks before the current evaluation, she presented to another hospital with fever, confusion, and word-finding difficulties. At the time of that presentation, the patient was inattentive and disoriented, and mild expressive aphasia without motor deficits was present. She had a large, bleeding exophytic mass in the right breast.\nDr. Janice N. Thai: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed a wedge-shaped area of low density in the left temporoparietal region. This finding is consistent with acute infarction.\nDr. Shahamatdar: A screening test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was positive. Laboratory studies, including a complete blood count, were notable for a hemoglobin level of 4.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 11.0 to 15.0), a mean corpuscular volume of 69.7 fl (reference range, 80.0 to 100.0), and a platelet count of 922,000 per microliter (reference range, 130,000 to 400,000).\nDr. Thai: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a large cystic and solid mass in the right breast, measuring 14.9 cm by 16.2 cm by 20.0 cm (Figure 1A and 1B). Associated prominence of the intramammary, internal mammary, subpectoral, and axillary lymph nodes was observed. Heterogeneous lesions of the ribs and pulmonary nodules that could indicate metastatic disease were also noted (Figure 1C). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, provided additional evidence of ischemic stroke and showed no evidence of intracranial metastases (Figure 1D and 1E).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Shahamatdar: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Packed red cells were transfused, and a compressive bandage was applied to the breast lesion. By hospital day 2, the patient\u2019s confusion and inattention had resolved, but mild expressive aphasia persisted. Consent was obtained from the patient, and she underwent incisional biopsy of the breast lesion while under local anesthesia. The patient\u2019s hospitalization was complicated by cellulitis in the right arm at the site where a peripheral intravenous catheter had been placed, for which she was treated with intravenous antibiotic agents. She was discharged on hospital day 11 with pathological results pending, and follow-up was planned with the breast oncology clinic of this hospital.\nFour days after discharge, the patient had a sudden onset of profuse bleeding from the breast lesion, which led to hypotension, and she was again admitted to the other hospital. She received a total of 5 units of packed red cells, and bleeding was managed conservatively with sterile gauze and compressive bandaging. No further episodes of bleeding occurred. On hospital day 4, she was discharged home with plans to attend a multidisciplinary oncology evaluation at this hospital 2 days later.\nIn the breast oncology clinic, the patient reported worsening discomfort, bleeding, and drainage from the breast mass and the associated wound. She noted that progressive fatigue had developed in recent weeks but reported no fever or chills. She had first noted a palpable lesion in the right breast when she was 32 years of age, approximately 27 years before the current presentation. The patient had pursued an evaluation with breast imaging at that time, and she recollected that the lesion had been characterized as a benign finding. A biopsy had not been performed. During the intervening years, she had not pursued routine medical care, including breast imaging. She attributed the lack of medical follow-up to ongoing demands related to caring for her young child and stressors in her personal and work life. She reported that slow but steady growth of the breast lesion had occurred during those years. Approximately 2 years before the current presentation, the patient had noted more rapid growth of the lesion with progressive skin breakdown, discomfort, and drainage that she thought was related to chronic infection.\nMenarche had occurred when the patient was 10 years of age and menopause at 50 years of age. The patient had had one pregnancy, and she had used hormonal contraception for a total of 15 years during her lifetime. She had not received any hormone-replacement therapy. At the time of the current presentation, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score was 1 (assessed on a scale of 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater disability). Medications included amlodipine, atorvastatin, ferrous sulfate, and polyethylene glycol. Her family history included breast cancer in her maternal aunt. She lived in New England with her adult son and was a small-business owner. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke cigarettes.\nOn physical examination, the oral temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/81 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A large, fungating breast mass was present, which had foci of necrosis and areas of dried blood without palpable ipsilateral lymphadenopathy. Auscultation of the heart was notable for tachycardia without murmur. A neurologic examination did not reveal motor deficits, and the previously reported expressive aphasia had resolved. The patient was attentive and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The affect and mood were appropriate, and she did not report hallucinations, suicidal ideation, or symptoms of depression. She had normal insight and capacity with regard to the nature of her diagnosis and recent clinical course.\nManagement decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Richard A. Newcomb: A 49-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\nFourteen months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated at another hospital because of pain in the right upper quadrant that had begun 4 days earlier and was associated with nausea and vomiting. Abdominal imaging revealed evidence of acute cholecystitis. Initial laboratory test results showed peripheral blasts that were suggestive of acute leukemia. The patient was transferred to a second hospital for additional evaluation. At the second hospital, abdominal imaging confirmed acute cholecystitis, and a calculus was found lodged in the neck of the gallbladder. The white-cell count was 4200 per microliter (reference range, 4200 to 9900), of which 40% were blasts. A peripheral-blood smear was notable for circulating blasts with Auer rods. The hemoglobin level was 11.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.0 to 17.4), and the platelet count was 22,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000). A bone marrow biopsy was performed, followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nDr. Andrew M. Crabbe: The bone marrow biopsy performed at the second hospital was inadequate owing to the small size of the specimen; however, intact bone marrow particles showed a cellularity of 95 to 100%. A 300-cell differential count on combined touch-imprint and aspirate smears showed 39% blasts, 3% promyelocytes, 19% neutrophils and precursors, 5% erythroid precursors, 30% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, and less than 1% basophils. The blasts were medium in size, with irregular nuclear contours, moderately clumped chromatin, occasional prominent small nucleoli, and scant granular cytoplasm. Auer rods were identified. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood identified myeloid blasts that were negative for CD34 and HLA-DR and positive for CD117, CD33, CD13, and myeloperoxidase. Cytogenetic analysis of the peripheral blood with the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a normal karyotype (46,XY) and no evidence of a t(15;17) chromosomal translocation. Molecular testing of the peripheral blood by means of dedicated polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing and next-generation sequencing identified mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, and NRAS and did not identify mutations in FLT3, IDH1, or IDH2. The overall findings of this testing were consistent with the World Health Organization classification of AML with mutated NPM1.\nDr. Newcomb: Induction chemotherapy with 7 days of cytarabine and 3 days of daunorubicin was administered. On day 34 after the initiation of chemotherapy, the absolute neutrophil count was 2.2 per microliter (reference range, 1.5 to 7.5), and the platelet count was 536,000 per microliter. A bone marrow biopsy performed on day 37 after initiation of chemotherapy revealed hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. There was no morphologic or phenotypic evidence of persistent or relapsed AML. A 300-cell sample of the bone marrow aspirate contained less than 1% blasts. Consolidation chemotherapy with four cycles of high-dose cytarabine was completed 8 months before the current presentation.\nDr. Crabbe: A bone marrow biopsy performed after the final cycle of chemotherapy revealed normocellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis; there was no morphologic or phenotypic evidence of AML. Next-generation sequencing of the bone marrow biopsy specimen revealed no pathogenic mutations.\nDr. Newcomb: The patient remained well for 7 months. One month before the current presentation, mild leukopenia developed, and more frequent laboratory monitoring was instituted. One week before the current presentation, the white-cell count was 2600 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 10,000), of which 13% were peripheral blasts. The patient was referred to this hospital for evaluation.\nOn presentation to this hospital, the patient reported a 3-week history of progressive fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, exercise intolerance, widespread muscle aches, and night sweats. He noted that similar symptoms had preceded his initial diagnosis.\nMedical history included obesity and hypertension. The patient was not taking medications on a regular basis. He was allergic to chlorhexidine, which caused rash. He lived in rural New England with his wife and four children. He worked as a software engineer. He did not smoke, and he drank alcohol rarely. His mother had coronary artery disease, and a sister had had a stroke. He had three other siblings who were healthy. There was no family history of leukemia or other hematologic disorders.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 35.7\u00b0C. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 43. No lymphadenopathy, rashes, or skin lesions were present. The remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 5830 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), of which 39.6% were blasts.

Wing: A 48-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fatigue and swelling in both legs.\nThe patient had been well until 8 months before the current admission, when fatigue and lethargy developed. He thought the fatigue was associated with alcohol consumption and reduced his intake to 12 beers weekly; before this, he had consumed 24 beers weekly for 15 years. Three months before the current admission, the patient\u2019s weight had decreased by 9.1 kg. However, 3 weeks before this admission, the weight had increased by 9.6 kg and swelling developed in both legs. He thought the weight gain was related to diet changes, including consumption of pizza, pasta, and soup, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nOne week before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He was instructed to elevate his legs, wear compression stockings, and decrease dietary sodium to 2 g daily. On the day of the current admission, the leg swelling had not abated and new abdominal distention occurred. He called the primary care clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, a review of systems was notable for fatigue, lethargy, decreased appetite, abdominal bloating, constipation, penile swelling, decreased libido, intolerance of cold temperatures, and ankle and knee pain in both legs that was worse when the patient was climbing stairs. There was no fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, or hematochezia.\nSixteen months before the current evaluation, the patient had been admitted to this hospital with pneumonia involving the right upper and middle lobes that was due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. During that admission, he received diagnoses of diabetes and normocytic anemia. After discharge from the hospital, laboratory evaluation revealed a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.1% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4). Metformin was prescribed, and follow-up evaluation was recommended; however, the patient had not returned to the primary care clinic before the current illness.\nThe patient had not started taking metformin until 3 weeks before the current evaluation; he took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He lived with his wife and two children in an urban area of New England. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia; he did not know the health of his father or paternal half-siblings.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 98/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.3. The patient did not have jaundice, scleral icterus, or spider angiomas. He had jugular venous distention and an S3 gallop; there were no rales. The abdomen was distended, with dullness on percussion of the flanks; there was no hepatosplenomegaly. There was 2+ symmetric pitting edema in the lower legs up to the knees. Mild palmar erythema was present; there was no asterixis.\nThe blood glucose level was 402 mg per deciliter (22.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]); the glycated hemoglobin level was 11.6%.

    "user_input": "Dr. Yanki Okuducu (Pediatrics): A newborn girl was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of this hospital because of cardiorespiratory arrest at delivery.\nThe newborn\u2019s mother was a 19-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 1) with a history of hepatitis C virus infection. Pregnancy was complicated by urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection that was treated in the second trimester, as well as gestational hypertension. Serial ultrasound surveys of the fetal anatomy performed between 20 weeks 1 day of gestation and 39 weeks 6 days of gestation revealed dilatation of the urinary tract on the right side. Ultrasonography of the fetal heart was normal.\nAt 40 weeks 0 days of gestation, spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred, and the newborn\u2019s mother was admitted to this hospital. Fetal heart tracings indicated nonreassuring fetal status, and at 22 hours 39 minutes of labor, a cesarean section was performed. The uterus was incised, and the amniotic fluid was noted to be stained with meconium. Six minutes later, the newborn was delivered; she was in a breech position at delivery. The birth weight was 3575 g (62nd percentile), the length 50 cm (42nd percentile), and the head circumference 35.5 cm (72nd percentile).\nThe newborn had limp tone and no respiratory effort. Ventilatory support was initiated, and the trachea was intubated. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed. Doses of epinephrine were administered through the endotracheal tube and an umbilical venous catheter, as were boluses of normal saline. After 16 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The Apgar scores at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes were 1, 0, 0, 1, and 3, respectively. The newborn was admitted to the NICU.\nOn the patient\u2019s arrival in the NICU, the axillary temperature was 34.9\u00b0C, the heart rate 141 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 84/59 mm Hg. The oxygen saturation was 97% while she was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in pressure-control mode. A course of therapeutic hypothermia was initiated.\nDr. Evan J. Zucker: Chest radiography (Figure 1A) revealed a small-to-moderate pneumothorax in the medial aspect of the pleural cavity on the right side. Subtle lucency in the middle-to-lower thorax was present on the left side, a finding attributed to a possible left pneumothorax or air trapping.\nFIGURE 1\n\nChest Radiographs.\nDr. Okuducu: Needle thoracentesis was performed on the right side, and 20 ml of air was removed. Empirical treatment with ampicillin and ceftazidime was started. On day 2, increased work of breathing developed, and additional imaging was performed.\nDr. Zucker: Repeat chest radiography (Figure 1B) showed resolution of the right pneumothorax and development of a large left pneumothorax with extensive collapse of the left lung. Needle thoracentesis was performed on the left side, and 27 ml of air was removed. Chest radiography performed after thoracentesis (Figure 1C) showed that the left pneumothorax had decreased in size and inflation of the left lung had increased.\nDr. Angela R. Shih: Pathological examination of the placenta revealed meconium-stained membranes. There was evidence of acute chorioamnionitis with fetal vascular involvement and bacterial organisms on and in the membranes.\nDr. Okuducu: During the next 2 days, the difference between the preductal oxygen saturation and the postductal oxygen saturation ranged from 5 to 15 percentage points, a finding suggestive of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. The fraction of inspired oxygen on the mechanical ventilator was increased to 1.0, and the administration of inhaled nitric oxide was initiated. Hypotension was treated with fluid resuscitation, and dopamine and milrinone infusions were started. Empirical treatment with vancomycin was also started.\nOn transthoracic echocardiography, biventricular systolic function was at the low end of the normal range, and the right ventricle was moderately enlarged. A patent ductus arteriosus (measuring 2.9 mm in diameter), a midmuscular ventricular septal defect (measuring 2.0 mm in diameter), and a patent foramen ovale (measuring 2.5 mm in diameter) were present; each of these features was associated with bidirectional shunting. Tricuspid regurgitation (peak gradient, 58 mm Hg; arterial blood pressure, 66/36 mm Hg) and ventricular septal flattening were present, findings suggestive of elevated right ventricular pressure due to pulmonary hypertension.\nUltrasonography of the kidneys and bladder revealed severe dilatation of the urinary tract on the right side; the left kidney was normal. The patient had an episode of rhythmic myoclonic jerking of the left leg that progressed to shaking of the left leg and arm, and phenobarbital was administered. Electroencephalography confirmed that a seizure originating in the midline posterior region had occurred. The seizure had lasted 25 minutes and had resolved spontaneously before the administration of phenobarbital. Ultrasonography of the head was normal.\nOn day 4, the patient completed the 72-hour course of therapeutic hypothermia, and rewarming began. The blood pressure decreased. The milrinone infusion was gradually discontinued, the dopamine infusion dose was increased, an epinephrine infusion was started, and hydrocortisone was administered. The newborn had episodes of agitation that were associated with labile oxygen saturation. Chest radiography showed that the left pneumothorax had continued to decrease in size; patchy opacities were seen throughout the right lung. Transthoracic echocardiography showed depressed right ventricular function.\nDuring the next week, the pressor dose was increased. The periods of decreased oxygen saturation became more frequent and more prolonged, and ventilatory support was increased. On day 11, the oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in pressure-control mode (peak inspiratory pressure, 31 cm of water; positive end-expiratory pressure, 9 cm of water; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0), along with inhaled nitric oxide. Empirical therapy with vancomycin, ampicillin, and ceftazidime was stopped after the patient completed 10-day courses.\nOn day 16, the axillary temperature increased to 38.8\u00b0C. Chest radiography showed an opacity in the left lower lobe and a small left pleural effusion, as well as linear opacities in both upper lobes. Empirical treatment with oxacillin and gentamicin was started. On day 19, ventilatory support remained elevated, and empirical antibiotic therapy was transitioned to vancomycin and cefepime.\nDr. Zucker: On day 21, repeat chest radiography (Figure 1D) showed a persistent opacity in the left lower lobe. Empirical therapy with vancomycin was discontinued.\nDr. Okuducu: A diagnostic test was performed.",

She also had headache and mild, diffuse joint and muscle pain. She had had no fever or sick contacts.\nThe patient had obesity, anxiety, and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Medications included fluoxetine and dextroamphetamine\u2013amphetamine; there were no known drug allergies. Menarche had occurred when she was 11 years of age, and her last menstrual period had been 2 months earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke tobacco. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her mother, father, and sister, as well as her pet dog, cat, and lizard. She attended a technical high school with an emphasis on agriculture, and she had frequent interactions with marine and farm animals through school. Her family history included colorectal cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in her maternal grandfather, diverticulosis in her maternal grandmother and mother, psoriasis in her maternal grandmother and uncle, and celiac disease in her paternal cousin. Her father had hyperlipidemia, and her mother had had one miscarriage, which had occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 94/68 mm Hg. The weight was 89.8 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.7. The patient appeared pale, tired, and uncomfortable because of pain. The mucous membranes were dry. The abdomen was nondistended, and there was mild tenderness in both lower quadrants. There was no ulceration or rash.\nThe white-cell count was 10,690 per microliter (reference range in children 12 to 17 years of age, 4500 to 10,700), the platelet count 188,000 per microliter, and the hemoglobin level 9.8 g per deciliter. The blood level of C-reactive protein was 248.0 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 71 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, and ondansetron were administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Admission, Hospital Day 5\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201316.0, 9.8, 8.8\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 31.4, 27.6\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 188,000, 67,000\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201313,000, 10,690, 13,490\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l)\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20138100, 9000, 10,020\nLymphocytes, 1200\u20135200, 1120, 2290\nMonocytes, 200\u20131400, 360, 780\nEosinophils, 0\u20131000, 100, 140\nBasophils, 0\u2013400, 30, 20\n\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 16.6, 17.3\nProthrombin-time international normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.4, 1.4\nActivated partial-thromboplastin time (sec), 22.0\u201336.0, 47.0, 50.0\nD-dimer (ng/ml), 0\u2013500, \u2014, >10,000\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201320, 71, \u2014\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), 0.0\u20138.0, 248.0, 66.9\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/liter), 110\u2013210, \u2014, 299\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201333, 52, 5766\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201332, 39, 1429\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 50\u2013117, 207, 189\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 0.3, 0.9\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 2.4, 2.9\nGlobulin (g/dl), 1.9\u20134.1, 4.3, 1.7\n\nOn hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level was 8.2 g per deciliter, and one unit of packed red cells was transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed.\nDr. Maureen M. Leonard: On EGD, two cratered esophageal ulcers were located 30 cm from the incisors (Figure 1A). The proximal, middle, and distal portions of the esophagus were normal. Diffuse mild inflammation \u2014 characterized by erythema and friability \u2014 was found in the cardia, gastric fundus, and gastric antrum (Figure 1B). The duodenum appeared normal. Biopsy specimens were obtained throughout the procedure for histologic evaluation.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImages Obtained during Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and Colonoscopy.\nWhen the patient was being positioned on the procedure table for the colonoscopy, a large volume of bright-red blood was noted to be draining from the rectum. Perianal and digital rectal examinations did not reveal a source of bleeding. Emergency radiography of the abdomen did not reveal free air, and the colonoscopy was started. On colonoscopy, the rectum and proximal sigmoid colon appeared normal (Figure 1C). However, as the colonoscope was advanced farther into the sigmoid colon, multiple nonobstructing, large, friable, dark-violet lesions were identified and biopsied (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F). Because of narrowing and severe friability, the area was not traversed with the endoscope, and the procedure was aborted.\nDr. Mauney: The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of this hospital. During the subsequent 2 days, an additional two units of packed red cells were transfused. Treatment with pantoprazole was started.\nDr. Sjirk J. Westra: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and chest was performed (Figure 2A through 2D). There was irregular thickening of the large bowel wall and adjacent fat stranding, with sparing of the distal sigmoid colon and rectum. The kidneys had multifocal patchy areas of hypoattenuation.\nFIGURE 2\n\nInitial Imaging Studies.\nDr. Mauney: On hospital day 5, tachycardia and tachypnea developed. The hemoglobin level was 8.8 g per deciliter, and the platelet count was 67,000 per microliter. The prothrombin time was 17.3 seconds (reference range, 11.5 to 14.5), the prothrombin-time international normalized ratio 1.4 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), the activated partial-thromboplastin time 50.0 seconds (reference range, 22.0 to 36.0), and the blood d-dimer level greater than 10,000 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Westra: Thoracic CT angiography revealed a central filling defect in the distal right pulmonary artery, a finding consistent with pulmonary embolism (Figure 2E). There was also a large right pleural effusion.\nDr. Mauney: A diagnostic test was performed.",

Roberts: A 41-year-old woman who had undergone renal transplantation was admitted to this hospital because of bloody stools and thrombocytopenia.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 weeks before this admission, when mild rectal discomfort and nonbloody diarrhea developed. The episodes of diarrhea occurred several times a day and were not associated with fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.\nTwo weeks before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at this hospital. The abdominal and rectal examinations were normal. The hemoglobin level was 11.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 14.0 to 18.0) and the platelet count 129,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Stool cultures and tests of the stool for Clostridioides difficile antigen and toxin and Shiga toxin were negative, as was examination of the stool for ova and parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with docusate was stopped, treatment with topical rectal hydrocortisone cream was started, and a recommendation was made to increase the amount of fiber in the diet.

A rectal examination revealed mild tenderness and thin yellow-brown liquid stool, with no evidence of blood or an external anal injury. A radiograph of the abdomen was normal. Docusate, senna, and topical lidocaine jelly were prescribed.\nThree days before this admission, bowel movements with tarry black and loose maroon stools and dark clots began to occur multiple times a day. When the episodes increased in frequency to every hour and there was bright-red blood per rectum, the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported severe rectal pain and burning, as well as fatigue, dizziness, and weakness. She did not report fever, chills, abdominal pain, hematemesis, hemoptysis, epistaxis, rash, bruising, hematuria, or menorrhagia.\nThe patient was congenitally deaf. She had received a diagnosis of kidney disease 12 years earlier, when proteinuria and hypertension developed during pregnancy and did not resolve postpartum. Pathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen had reportedly revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The patient was presumed to have Alport\u2019s syndrome; no genetic testing had been performed.\nTen years before the current evaluation, the patient had discontinued all prescribed medications, including prednisone and labetalol, without talking to her doctors; 3 years later, she presented to this hospital with dyspnea on exertion and end-stage renal failure. Hemodialysis was started and continued until a deceased-donor renal transplantation was performed 6 months before the current evaluation.\nRoutine pretransplantation serologic testing of the patient revealed IgG antibodies to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and no antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV). Serologic testing of the donor also revealed IgG antibodies to EBV and no antibodies to CMV. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin, belatacept, prednisone, and everolimus was initiated; famciclovir was administered for 3 months after transplantation. Treatment with prednisone was stopped 2 months after transplantation, when diabetes developed.\nAt the time of the current evaluation, medications included aspirin, linagliptin, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, and omeprazole, as well as cholecalciferol, docusate, senna, topical hydrocortisone cream, and topical lidocaine jelly. The dose of everolimus had been decreased 1 month before this evaluation; belatacept had last been infused 2 weeks earlier. There were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived with her male partner and young son in an urban area of New England. She had not traveled recently. She had previously worked part-time as a teacher. There had been no exposure to animals other than two pet dogs. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol. Her sister was deaf and had a history of renal failure that had led to renal transplantation. Her father had a history of diabetes and renal failure that required hemodialysis.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 85/46 mm Hg, the pulse 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared pale and unwell. There was no jaundice or lymphadenopathy. There were palatal petechiae and sublingual ecchymoses, but there was no bleeding from the gums or nose. There was a healed surgical incision in the right lower abdomen and no tenderness over the renal allograft. A rectal examination revealed tenderness and dark blood with clots.\nThe hemoglobin level was 6.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 0 per microliter. A peripheral-blood smear showed red cells that were generally normal in size and morphology, with few hypochromic cells and rare pencil cells; there were no schistocytes or platelets. A direct antiglobulin test was negative. Blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Onofrio A. Catalano: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no bowel-wall thickening or distention. The spleen and liver were normal in size. The renal allograft was visible in the right lower quadrant (Figure 1). The transplanted kidney was enlarged and surrounded by extensive perinephric fat stranding. A small amount of free fluid was also present. There was moderate hydroureteronephrosis that extended up to the ureterovesical anastomosis. The renal collecting system, pelvis, and ureter contained spontaneously hyperdense material that was suggestive of blood breakdown products. No obstructing calculi were seen.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Renal Allograft.\nDr. Roberts: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the blood pressure increased to 97/53 mm Hg. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with everolimus and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was stopped. During the next 24 hours, 4 units of packed red cells and 5 units of pooled platelets were transfused. On the second hospital day, the hemoglobin level was 11.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 4 per microliter.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. John H. Stone: A 59-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of headache and progressive neurologic dysfunction.\nTen months before this evaluation, daily fever with a temperature of up to 38.9\u00b0C, chills, myalgias, drenching night sweats, and pressure and pain in both cheeks and ears developed. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported rhinorrhea and fatigue but no headache, pharyngitis, or dyspnea, and he had no sick contacts. On examination, the temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/64 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was ill-appearing, and the maxillary sinuses were tender on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 463,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 400,000); the remainder of the complete blood count and the differential count were normal. Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was prescribed.\nDuring the next 2 weeks, fever, night sweats, and sinus and facial pain continued. Diffuse headache developed, along with jaw soreness, scalp tenderness, and hip and shoulder stiffness. The patient was evaluated again by his primary care physician. He reported weight loss of 2 kg, episodic double vision, and hip pain that caused difficulty in standing and climbing stairs. The physical examination was unchanged. Urinalysis was normal. A test for heterophile antibody and an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative, as were screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus and Lyme disease. Chest radiography and computed tomography of the sinuses were normal. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist at another hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported persistent fever and frontal, temporal, and maxillary headache. There were palpable temporal artery pulses without tenderness; the remainder of the examination was normal, including the absence of bruits on auscultation of large vessels. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 108 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), the blood level of C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), the blood level of rheumatoid factor 24 IU per milliliter (reference value, <14), and the blood level of aldolase 8.4 IU per milliliter (reference value, <8.1). Biopsy of the right temporal artery was performed. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed no granulomas, but evidence of chronic inflammation of the temporal artery and fibrinoid necrosis of an adjacent small vessel were noted.\nA diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis was made, and treatment with prednisone was started. Within a few days after initiation of treatment, headache, fever, jaw pain, and joint stiffness abated. The next month, an attempt to lower the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent severe headache with scalp tenderness, jaw pain, and hip stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 84 mg per liter. Treatment with weekly subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab was initiated.\nDuring the next 6 weeks, another attempt was made to taper the prednisone dose. After 1 week of treatment at a lower prednisone dose, and 5 months after the development of initial symptoms (5 months before the current evaluation), the patient reported headache that he described as \u201cthe worst headache of my life,\u201d with associated jaw pain and diplopia. The pain was worst at the right frontal and maxillary areas, but the entire right side of the face, including the scalp and neck, was affected. The patient returned to the other hospital for evaluation. He was found to have palsies of the third and sixth cranial nerves on the right side. The patient was admitted to the neurology service at the other hospital. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing revealed a slightly elevated myeloperoxidase antibody level, at 1.9 U (reference value, <1.0), but antibodies to proteinase 3 were not detected. Blood levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Otto Rapalino: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed abnormal expansion and enhancement of the right cavernous sinus that extended into the right superior orbital fissure and right pterygopalatine fossa, as well as abnormal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement of the adjacent right middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Figure 1C and 1D) showed masslike pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement in the upper cervical spinal canal at C2\u2013C4 with an anterior predominance as well as more circumferentially at the cervicothoracic junction (C6\u2013T3) with a posterior predominance, with resultant canal narrowing and mild cord compression at C7\u2013T2. There was no spinal cord edema.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head and Spine Obtained 5 Months before the Current Evaluation.\nDr. John Stone: A lumbar puncture was performed; an opening pressure was not recorded. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose level was 65 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 80 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.4 mmol per liter]), and the protein level was 126 mg per deciliter (reference range, 15 to 45), with 2 red cells per microliter and 8 white cells per microliter (of which 79% were lymphocytes). Gram\u2019s staining and cultures of the CSF were negative. Tests for CSF myelin basic protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme, cryptococcal antigen, cysticercosis IgG, mycobacterial DNA, Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA, and borrelia DNA were negative, as was a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. Cytologic analysis of the CSF showed a mixed population of mononuclear cells with rare plasma cells. The CSF immunoglobulin level was 19 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0 to 6), with 5 oligoclonal bands.\nOn the eighth hospital day, a meningeal biopsy was performed. Treatment with high-dose prednisone was started, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 2 weeks, the patient continued taking the prednisone, but the facial and head pain worsened. He was readmitted to the other hospital to receive 3 days of treatment with parenteral pulse-dose methylprednisolone.\nPathological examination of the meningeal biopsy specimen revealed a densely fibrotic, chronically inflamed dura mater with large numbers of CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ T lymphocytes and with focal collections of CD20+ B lymphocytes. There was a large number of polyclonal plasma cells with more than 100 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-power field. Storiform fibrosis was present, and elastin staining revealed obliterative venulitis. Some of the inflammatory foci were angiocentric, but no vasculitis was present. There were rare foci of fibrinoid necrosis and some neutrophils, with rare giant cells but no granulomas. A diagnosis of IgG4-related disease was made, and rituximab was administered. Two days after the first rituximab dose, a pulmonary embolism was diagnosed, and treatment with apixaban was initiated. Two weeks later, repeat imaging was obtained to evaluate the treatment response.\nDr. Rapalino: Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased abnormal enhancement in the right cavernous sinus and right middle cranial fossa and new abnormal enhancement in the left cavernous sinus and adjacent left middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Figure 2C and 2D) also showed progression in the extent and thickness of the ventral and dorsal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement. There was also progression of the canal stenosis, which had become severe, and cord compression at the C7 level. There was no cord signal abnormality.\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head and Spine Obtained 4 Months before the Current Evaluation.\nDr. John Stone: The patient received a second infusion of rituximab, as well as treatment with oral dexamethasone. Three weeks later, and 7 months after the development of initial symptoms (3 months before the current evaluation), the patient was admitted to the other hospital because of worsening headache, nausea, and vomiting. Examination was notable for new sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and deviation of the tongue to the left. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Treatment with dexamethasone was continued, and the patient was discharged home. Three weeks after placement of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the patient was admitted again to the other hospital because of streptococcal infection. Two months after discharge, and 10 months after the development of initial symptoms, he was seen in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation.\nThe patient had a history of migraines, hypertension, and a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. Medications included apixaban, baclofen, dexamethasone, furosemide, gabapentin, lisinopril, and metoprolol. He was a retired businessman and lived with his wife. He drank one glass of wine weekly and had quit smoking more than 40 years before the current evaluation. His maternal grandfather had died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm.\nThe temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 118/79 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The scalp hair was thin. He had cushingoid facies; acne on the face, back, and chest; striae on the flanks; and proximal muscle weakness of the arms and legs. There was no scalp or temporal tenderness. He had no tongue lesions or oral ulcers, and the nasal examination showed no crusting. Extraocular movements were intact. There was no arthritis. The chest, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were normal. The complete blood count and the differential count were normal, as was a urinalysis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 52 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 5 mg per liter. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed an IgM level of 22 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334) and normal levels of IgG and IgA. ANCA testing was negative.\nA diagnosis and management decisions were made.",

Price: A chest radiograph showed faint nodular opacities in the lungs, predominantly in the upper lobes. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple fluid-filled small-bowel loops with associated mild mesenteric edema and trace ascites. There was no biliary dilatation. In addition, there were numerous hypoattenuating hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement.\nDr. Gumuser: The patient was admitted to the other hospital with a diagnosis of possible small-bowel obstruction and pneumonia. Treatment with intravenous fluids and ceftriaxone, oral doxycycline, and bowel rest was initiated. On the second hospital day, additional imaging studies of the liver were obtained.\nDr. Price: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen (Figure 1), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilobar hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement, high T2 signal, and diffusion restriction.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Gumuser: Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture, and treatment with intravenous metronidazole was initiated. On the third hospital day, the abdominal pain had resolved, and the patient began drinking clear fluids. On the fourth hospital day, ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was performed. While the results of the liver biopsy were pending, the patient resumed a normal diet, with no recurrence of abdominal pain. Treatment with oral doxycycline and intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole was continued.\nDr. Price: On the sixth hospital day, CT of the chest (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed numerous irregular cysts and cavitary nodules in the lungs, which were most pronounced in the upper lobes, as well as solid and subsolid parenchymal nodules that measured less than 1.0 cm in diameter. There were multiple nodules in the thyroid gland, measuring up to 2.8 cm in diameter in the inferior left thyroid lobe. There was a 1.7-cm nodule with soft-tissue attenuation in the right breast.\nDr. Gumuser: On the eighth hospital day, bronchoscopy was performed. The airways were inspected to the segmental level, and no abnormalities were visualized. Transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in the right upper lobe. Examination of the BAL fluid revealed 321 white cells per microliter (reference range, 94 to 175). Gram\u2019s staining and examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear of the BAL fluid were negative.\nOn the ninth hospital day, results of the liver biopsy became available, showing extensive eosinophilic infiltration of the liver parenchyma with associated moderate steatosis. Staining of the biopsy specimen for microorganisms, including mycobacteria, was negative. Cultures of blood obtained on the second hospital day showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further care.\nOn arrival, the patient reported a mild sore throat that had developed after bronchoscopy, but there was no abdominal pain. She had lost 2 kg of weight before the hospitalization, in the context of dietary changes. She had no history of fever but reported a several-year history of mild shortness of breath with walking that she attributed to smoking. Her surgical history included cholecystectomy and cesarean section. Results of a Papanicolaou test performed 3 months before this presentation had been normal; the patient had not undergone mammography or colonoscopy. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived in an urban area of New England. She was born in Portugal and had immigrated to the United States 40 years earlier. She had not traveled recently; her last trip had been to Portugal 25 years before this admission. The patient was divorced, lived alone, and worked in a medical laboratory. She had no known exposure to chemicals or dust; a coworker at a previous office job had had an atypical infection attributed to mold in the workplace. She had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. She drank alcohol three times a week and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from colon cancer at 43 years of age.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 130/64 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was normal.\nA diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Daniele Lerner (Pediatrics): An 18-year-old man with the Dravet syndrome was admitted to this hospital because of fever and increased frequency of seizures.\nThe Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes the sodium channel \u03b11 subunit (SCN1A), had been diagnosed during evaluation for intractable seizures that had begun when the patient was 6 months of age. He had had developmental delay, was nonverbal, and required supervision while walking because of a slow, shuffling gait with associated falls.\nThe patient was in his usual state of health until 2 months before this admission, when his parents noticed swelling of the left foot after a fall. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital, and radiography of the left foot was reportedly normal.\nTwo weeks before this admission, swelling of the left foot increased. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician, and additional imaging of the foot was recommended. The patient was already scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (which was planned to be performed with the patient under general anesthesia) as part of a research study for patients with the Dravet syndrome.1 MRI of the left foot was performed at the same time.\nDr. Teresa Victoria: MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse cerebral volume loss. There were incidental secretions filling the sphenoid and frontal sinuses that had heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted images and hyperintense signal intensity on T1-weighted images; mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses was also noted. MRI of the left foot, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal bone marrow edema in the midfoot and hindfoot. There was no fracture, dislocation, or joint effusion.\nDr. Lerner: Treatment with amoxicillin was initiated by the patient\u2019s primary care physician to treat possible sinusitis. Seven days before this admission, the patient\u2019s parents noticed increased swelling and new warmth of the left foot, and the patient appeared uncomfortable when bearing weight on that foot. The oral temperature measured at home was 38.3\u00b0C. Five days before this admission, bruising of the left foot developed, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient was afebrile and appeared well. There was swelling, bruising, and tenderness of the left foot. The white-cell count was 5870 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the hemoglobin level 11.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the blood level of C-reactive protein (CRP) 23.9 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

During the next 5 days, his parents noticed that he was less interactive than usual. He had intermittent diaphoresis and tachycardia, and the frequency of seizures had increased from one every 2 to 3 days to two or three seizures daily. One day before this admission, the oral temperature measured at home was 38.1\u00b0C. After a telephone consultation with the patient\u2019s primary care physician, treatment with amoxicillin was changed to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate. The seizure frequency did not decrease, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nAdditional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. They had not observed nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or cough. The patient had gingivitis that had recently worsened; during the 2 weeks before this admission, there had been new bleeding from the gums and bleeding from the nose. The patient was following a ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment for seizures; because of multiple food allergies, the ketogenic formula was administered through a gastrostomy tube. He had loose stools, which the parents attributed to tube feeding; the stools were unchanged in volume and frequency. He had had two episodes of nonbilious, nonbloody emesis during the week before this admission.\nThe patient\u2019s parents also reported that 7 months before this admission, the patient had begun to have fever, vomiting, and increased volume and frequency of stools; coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was diagnosed, and the volume of the ketogenic formula was decreased by half for 4 days until vomiting resolved. Medications included amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, cannabidiol, clobazam, famotidine, glycopyrrolate, levocarnitine, levocetirizine, a multivitamin, potassium citrate, and phosphorus, as well as lorazepam as needed for seizures lasting longer than several minutes. He had no known drug allergies. He lived with his father and two cats in an urban area of New England; he occasionally stayed with his mother in a rural area of New England.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the blood pressure 124/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.8. The patient appeared tired and flushed but was alert and interactive. There was low muscular bulk and tone. The gingivae were erythematous and bleeding (Figure 2), and several dental caries were seen. There was no sinus tenderness or discharge. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the heart sounds were normal. The abdomen was nontender, and the insertion site of the gastrostomy tube was not erythematous or indurated. The walking cast was removed; there was edema and bruising of the left foot (Figure 2).\nFIGURE 2\n\nClinical Photographs.\nThe results of tests of liver function and kidney function were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes and glucose. Urinalysis was normal; there were 2+ ketones (reference value, negative; however, 2+ is considered to be a normal value for patients following a therapeutic ketogenic diet). The blood level of CRP had increased to 74.0 mg per liter; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was negative. Stool testing for Clostridium difficile antigen and toxin was negative, as was a stool examination for ova and parasites. Specimens of blood and stool were sent for culture. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest revealed a patchy opacity in the right lung base. Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed diffuse bone demineralization and fractures of the second metatarsal and cuboid, findings that were similar to those seen on previous imaging. There was sclerosis in the proximal first and distal fourth and fifth metatarsals that was suggestive of new fractures. A crescentic osseous fragment was thought to be an avulsed fragment of bone.\nDr. Lerner: A diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made, treatment with intravenous fluids and ampicillin\u2013sulbactam was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 7 days, he had no fever, but tachycardia persisted. Blood cultures showed no growth, and stool cultures showed normal intestinal flora. The CRP level had increased to 108.1 mg per liter, the d-dimer level was 6953 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500), and the hemoglobin level had decreased to 7.0 g per deciliter. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Victoria: Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed multiple new areas of cortical erosions, including the medial base of the first metatarsal and the medial navicular bone. MRI of the left tibia, fibula, and foot (Figure 3), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed worsening bone edema in the left foot; foci of bone edema were also seen in the proximal tibia and fibula. Multiple fractures that had been seen on previous imaging of the left foot were noted, and there were intraosseous cystic hemorrhagic foci within the calcaneal, cuboid, and second metatarsal fractures.\nFIGURE 3\n\nMRI of the Left Foot.\nDr. Lerner: On hospital day 8, the temporal temperature was 38.0\u00b0C. New nontender, purpuric macules were present on the fingers, hands (Figure 2), arms, and toes.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Nathan C. Praschan (Psychiatry): A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.\nFour months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.\nThree months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.\nOne month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed \u201cshaking and clenching\u201d movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.\nAt least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician\u2019s hand was placed on the patient\u2019s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient\u2019s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician\u2019s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.\nOn the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient\u2019s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 111/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.\nApproximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as \u201cpretty good\u201d and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.\nThe patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.\nBlood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

She was evaluated in a primary care clinic of another hospital and was told that a salivary gland may be obstructed. Treatment with sialagogues, increased oral hydration, warm compresses, and massage of the salivary glands were recommended. During the next 3 weeks, the lump in the left jaw increased in size, and swelling of the left side of the face and neck developed. Three weeks before this admission, she returned to the primary care clinic; treatment with cephalexin was started.\nEighteen days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the otolaryngology clinic of the other hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 132/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 86 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.0. There was swelling in the left mandibular and submandibular areas, with no erythema, fluctuance, or palpable salivary stones.\nDr. Hillary R. Kelly: Computed tomography (CT) of the face and neck was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the face (Figure 1) revealed a 3.7-cm mass in the left mandibular body, with lytic and expansile features and numerous internal wavy septations. Areas of marked thinning and obliteration were noted in the buccal and lingual cortexes of the mandible, and extension of the mass among the roots of the first molar, second molar, and premolar was observed. No fluid\u2013fluid or blood\u2013fluid levels were seen within the lesion. There was no lymphadenopathy. The patient was referred to the otolaryngology clinic at this hospital.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT Images of the Face.\nDr. Be: Fifteen days before this admission, the patient reported numbness and tingling in the lower lip and chin on the left side. She had had no fatigue, fever, chills, or redness and no pain in her face, jaw, or neck. On examination, she appeared well but had obvious facial asymmetry with swelling of the left mandible (Figure 2). There was a firm, mildly tender mass in the body of the left mandible that extended to the mandibular angle. Orthodontic braces were in place and dentition and jaw occlusion were normal. The remainder of the ear, nose, and throat examination was normal. The overlying skin was normal, and no anterior or posterior submandibular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was present. The blood levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride were normal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of coagulation and renal function. The calcium level was 11.8 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), and the albumin level was 4.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.3 to 5.0). Radiography of the chest was normal.\nFIGURE 2\n\nClinical Photographs before Excision of the Lesion.\nDr. Vania Nos\u00e9: An intraoral biopsy of the left mandibular mass was performed. Pathological examination (Figure 3C) of the biopsy specimen revealed that the lesion was partially surrounded by reactive bone trabeculae, was hemorrhagic, and contained numerous osteoclast-type giant cells around extravasated red cells, findings that were consistent with a central giant-cell lesion or a central giant-cell granuloma.\nFIGURE 3\n\nSurgical Approach and Biopsy and Surgical Specimens.\nDr. Be: Ten days before this admission, the patient was seen in the oral and maxillofacial surgical clinic of this hospital, and admission for the excision of the left mandibular mass was planned.\nOn admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had normal growth and development and had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had finished the prescribed course of cephalexin and had taken no other medications; penicillin had caused fever and hives early in childhood. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her mother, stepfather, and two cats; she frequently stayed in another suburban area of New England with her father. The patient performed well in high school and participated in theater. She did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. Her mother had hypothyroidism; her father had obstructive sleep apnea. Her maternal grandmother had a history of hypothyroidism, parathyroid adenoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer; her paternal grandfather had died from colon cancer.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/85 mm Hg, and the heart rate 111 beats per minute. The physical examination was unchanged. The left mandibular mass was excised. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed abundant giant cells.\nOn the second hospital day, the calcium level was 12.6 mg per deciliter (3.2 mmol per liter) and the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 396 pg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 60).\nA diagnosis was made.",

Parsons (Medicine): A 75-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of arthritis, abdominal pain, edema, malaise, and fever.\nThree weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed waxing and waning \u201cthrobbing\u201d pain in the right upper abdomen, which she rated at 9 (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain) at its maximal intensity. The pain was associated with nausea and fever with a temperature of up to 39.0\u00b0C. Pain worsened after food consumption and was relieved with acetaminophen. During the 3 weeks before the current admission, edema developed in both legs; it had started at the ankles and gradually progressed upward to the hips. When the edema began to affect her ambulation, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems that was obtained from the patient and her family was notable for intermittent fever, abdominal bloating, anorexia, and fatigue that had progressed during the previous 3 weeks. The patient reported new orthopnea and nonproductive cough. Approximately 4 weeks earlier, she had had diarrhea for several days. During the 6 weeks before the current admission, the patient had lost 9 kg unintentionally; she also had had pain in the wrists and hands, 3 days of burning and dryness of the eyes, and diffuse myalgias. She had not had night sweats, dry mouth, jaw claudication, vision changes, urinary symptoms, or oral, nasal, or genital ulcers.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for multiple myeloma (for which treatment with thalidomide and melphalan had been initiated 2 years earlier and was stopped approximately 1 year before the current admission); hypothyroidism; chikungunya virus infection (diagnosed 7 years earlier); seropositive erosive rheumatoid arthritis affecting the hands, wrists, elbows, and shoulders (diagnosed 3 years earlier); vitiligo; and osteoarthritis of the right hip, for which she had undergone arthroplasty. Evidence of gastritis was reportedly seen on endoscopy that had been performed 6 months earlier. Medications included daily treatment with levothyroxine and acetaminophen and pipazethate hydrochloride as needed for cough. The patient consumed chamomile and horsetail herbal teas. She had no known allergies to medications, but she had been advised not to take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs after her diagnosis of multiple myeloma.\nApproximately 5 months before the current admission, the patient had emigrated from Central America. She lived with her daughter and grandchildren in an urban area of New England. She had previously worked in health care. She had no history of alcohol, tobacco, or other substance use. There was no family history of cancer or autoimmune, renal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, or cardiac disease.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 152/67 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She had a frail appearance and bitemporal cachexia. The weight was 41 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 15.2. Her dentition was poor; most of the teeth were missing, caries were present in the remaining teeth, and the mucous membranes were dry. She had abdominal tenderness on the right side and mild abdominal distention, without organomegaly or guarding. Bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy was palpable. Infrequent inspiratory wheezing was noted.\nThe patient had swan-neck deformity, boutonni\u00e8re deformity, ulnar deviation, and distal hyperextensibility of the thumbs (Fig. 1). Subcutaneous nodules were observed on the proximal interphalangeal joints of the second and third fingers of the right hand and on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger of the left hand. Synovial thickening of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the second fingers was noted. There was mild swelling and tenderness of the wrists. She had pain with flexion of the shoulders and right hip, and there was subtle swelling of the shoulders and right knee. Pitting edema (3+) and vitiligo were noted on the legs. No sclerodactyly, digital pitting, telangiectasias, appreciable calcinosis, nodules, nail changes (including pitting), or tophi were present. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nFIGURE 1\n\nPhotograph of the Hands.\nThe blood levels of glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, globulin, lactate, lipase, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal, as were the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 3+ protein and 3+ blood, and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field and granular casts. Urine and blood were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram met (at a borderline level) the voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Initial Consultation, Hospital Day 2, Hospital Day 3\n\nBlood\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201316.0, 8.3, 7.7, 7.6\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 26.2, 24.0, 23.4\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 18,740, 13,050, 8660\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l)\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 17,240, 12,480, \u2014\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 340, 460, \u2014\nEosinophils, <900, 170, 150, \u2014\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 76,000, 76,000, 93,000\n\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 135, 134, 134\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 4.1, 3.8, 4.3\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 104, 105, 104\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 25, 23, 26\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 23, 23, 23\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 1.26, 1.15, 1.48\nCystatin C (mg/liter), 0.61\u20130.95, \u2014, 3.29, 3.31\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 7.6, 7.8, 7.4\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.0\u20138.3, 5.4, 4.9, 5.0\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 2.2, 2.5, 2.0\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013115, 146, 170, 129\nCreatine kinase (U/liter), 40\u2013150, 15, \u2014, \u2014\nN-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (pg/ml), <900, 2345, \u2014, \u2014\n\nThyrotropin (\u00b5U/ml), 0.40\u20135.00, 14.90, \u2014, \u2014\nFree thyroxine (ng/dl), 0.9\u20131.8, 1.3, \u2014, \u2014\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/liter), 110\u2013210, \u2014, 233, 249\nD-dimer (ng/ml), <500, \u2014, >10,000, >10,000\nFibrinogen (mg/dl), 150\u2013400, \u2014, 367, 313\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), <8.0, \u2014, 17.2, 11.6\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201313, \u2014, 46, 41\nC3 (mg/dl), 81\u2013157, \u2014, 46, \u2014\nC4 (mg/dl), 12\u201339, \u2014, 7, \u2014\nIron (\u00b5g/dl), 30\u2013160, \u2014, 84, \u2014\nTotal iron-binding capacity (\u00b5g/dl), 230\u2013404, \u2014, 142, \u2014\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), 10\u2013200, \u2014, 2436, \u2014\nUric acid (mg/dl), 2.3\u20136.6, \u2014, 10.2, \u2014\nRheumatoid factor (IU/ml), 0\u201314, \u2014, 2072, \u2014\nAnti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (IU/ml), 0\u201316, \u2014, 479, \u2014\n\nIgG (mg/dl), 614\u20131295, \u2014, 1451, \u2014\nIgA (mg/dl), 69\u2013309, \u2014, 157, \u2014\nIgM (mg/dl), 53\u2013334, \u2014, 461, \u2014\n\nElectrophoresis and immunofixation, \u2014, \u2014, Normal pattern, mild diffuse increase in gamma globulin, no monoclonal spike, \u2014\n\nFree kappa light chains (mg/liter), 3.3\u201319.4, \u2014, 232.6, \u2014\nFree lambda light chains (mg/liter), 5.7\u201326.3, \u2014, 186.2, \u2014\nKappa:lambda ratio, 0.30\u20131.70, \u2014, 1.25, \u2014\n\nUrine\nCreatinine (mg/dl), \u2014, \u2014, 26, \u2014\nTotal protein (mg/dl), 0.0\u201313.5, \u2014, 127.4, \u2014\nTotal protein:creatinine ratio, <0.15, \u2014, 4.90, \u2014\n\nDr. Rene Balza Romero: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed scattered subcentimeter pulmonary nodules (including clusters in the right middle lobe and patchy and ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe), trace pleural effusion in the left lung, coronary and valvular calcifications, and trace pericardial effusion, ascites, and anasarca. The scans also showed slight enlargement of the axillary lymph nodes (up to 11 mm in the short axis) bilaterally and a chronic-appearing compression fracture involving the T12 vertebral body.\nDr. Parsons: Morphine and lactated Ringer\u2019s solution were administered intravenously. On the second day in the emergency department (also referred to as hospital day 2), the blood levels of haptoglobin, folate, and vitamin B12 were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A rapid antigen test for malaria was positive. Wright\u2013Giemsa staining of thick and thin peripheral-blood smears was negative for parasites; the smears also showed D\u00f6hle bodies and basophilic stippling. Antigliadin antibodies and anti\u2013tissue transglutaminase antibodies were not detected. Tests for hepatitis A IgG and hepatitis C antibodies were positive. Tests for hepatitis B core and surface antibodies were negative. A test for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) was negative.\nFindings on abdominal ultrasound imaging performed on the second day (Fig. 2A and 2B) were notable for a small volume of ascites and kidneys with echogenic parenchyma. Ultrasonography of the legs showed no deep venous thrombosis. An echocardiogram showed normal ventricular size and function, aortic sclerosis with mild aortic insufficiency, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, a right ventricular systolic pressure of 39 mm Hg, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion. Intravenous hydromorphone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies of the Abdomen and Hands.\nOn the third day (also referred to as hospital day 3), nucleic acid testing for cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and hepatitis C virus was negative, and a stool antigen test for Helicobacter pylori was negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also negative. Oral acetaminophen and ivermectin and intravenous hydromorphone and furosemide were administered.\nDr. Balza Romero: Radiographs of the hands (Fig. 2C through 2F) showed joint-space narrowing of both radiocarpal joints and proximal interphalangeal erosions involving both hands. Radiographs of the shoulders showed arthritis of the glenohumeral joint and alignment suggestive of a tear of the right rotator cuff. A radiograph of the pelvis showed diffuse joint-space narrowing of the left hip, without osteophytosis, and an intact right hip prosthesis.\nDr. Parsons: Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Grace R. Bobkowski (Medicine): A 50-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of confusion.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 months before the current presentation, when dysphagia developed. One month later, she was evaluated by her primary care physician. She reported having a sensation that pills and food were getting stuck in her throat when she swallowed. She was unable to take her medications, and her food intake had decreased to two eggs per day. She estimated that her weight had decreased by 5 kg during the previous month. She was referred for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which reportedly revealed ulceration of the gastrojejunal junction from a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass performed 12 years earlier but otherwise normal mucosa. Examination of biopsy specimens obtained during the procedure reportedly revealed findings consistent with lymphocytic esophagitis. Treatment with swallowed fluticasone was recommended.\nThree months before the current presentation, leg swelling developed, and the patient was again evaluated by her primary care physician. She had stopped using fluticasone after 1 week of treatment because she had not noticed any decrease in the dysphagia. Her weight had decreased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month earlier. Pitting edema was present in the legs. A diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency was considered, and compression stockings were recommended.\nTwo months before the current presentation, leg swelling worsened, arm swelling developed, and the patient had trouble performing activities of daily living. She was admitted to another hospital. She reported persistent dysphagia and reduced food intake. Her weight had increased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month earlier. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The blood albumin level was 2.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.5 to 4.8), and the zinc level was 0.36 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 0.66 to 1.10). Blood levels of vitamin B2, vitamin B12, folate, and methylmalonate were normal; the blood level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide was normal for the patient\u2019s age. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The albumin:creatinine ratio in a random urine sample was 11.6 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine (reference value, <30.0).

Pitting edema of the arms and legs was attributed to hypoalbuminemia from limited oral intake, which was related to dysphagia from untreated lymphocytic esophagitis. The use of fluticasone was encouraged, and supplemental nutritional drinks were recommended, along with a multivitamin and zinc sulfate. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was discharged home.\nOne month before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to this hospital because of confusion and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Escherichia coli. Confusion resolved with treatment of the UTI. Her weight had decreased by 2 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. The patient reported loose stools without blood or mucus, which had occurred for 1 month. Edema was present. The blood albumin level was 1.7 g per deciliter, the zinc level 0.3 \u03bcg per milliliter, the selenium level 34 ng per milliliter (reference range, 70 to 150), the vitamin A level 16.6 \u03bcg per deciliter (reference range, 32.5 to 78.0), and the vitamin C level 0.2 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.4 to 2.0). Blood levels of vitamin B1 and vitamin B3 were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nEGD showed ulceration of the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. Biopsy specimens of the esophagus, stomach, and jejunum showed normal mucosa. A biopsy specimen of the gastrojejunal anastomosis showed small-intestinal mucosa with erosion and nonspecific morphologic features; periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining was negative for microorganisms, Congo red staining was negative for amyloid, and immunohistochemical staining was negative for cytomegalovirus. Magnetic resonance enterography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of active inflammatory bowel disease. A high-protein diet was recommended, along with a multivitamin, zinc sulfate, and selenium. On the eighth hospital day, the patient was discharged home.\nAfter discharge, the patient initially felt well. The edema abated, and her appetite improved. She began to have six small meals and three protein shakes per day. Two weeks after discharge, and 1 week before the current presentation, confusion developed, and the gait became unsteady; she began using a walker for ambulation. During the next week, confusion increased, and she fell while walking. Her family brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, she was unable to answer questions about her history. Her family reported that she had had slowed and slurred speech for the past week and increasing difficulty with attention, including difficulty with holding a conversation. Other medical history included chronic back pain, bipolar disorder, seizure disorder, and ulcerative colitis. Medications included carbamazepine, ergocalciferol, fluticasone, gabapentin, mesalamine, methocarbamol, mirtazapine, a multivitamin, olanzapine, omeprazole, oxycodone\u2013acetaminophen, selenium, sucralfate, thiamine, topiramate, and zinc sulfate. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was receiving disability benefits and did not work because of chronic back pain. She had smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 35 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had endometrial cancer, and her father had lung cancer.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 89/52 mm Hg, the pulse 132 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.9. Her weight had decreased by 6 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. She appeared chronically ill and was lethargic but arose in response to voice. She moved her arms and legs but did not participate in a detailed neurologic examination. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The white-cell count was 17,150 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with neutrophil predominance. The blood zinc level was 0.35 \u03bcg per milliliter, the copper level 0.28 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 0.75 to 1.45), and the vitamin B6 level less than 2 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50). Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and 50 to 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nA chest radiograph was normal, without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Urine, blood, and stool specimens were obtained for culture. Three liters of intravenous lactated Ringer\u2019s solution were administered, and the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Three hours after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, she became more lethargic and had no response to voice; she reacted to being shaken but did not open her eyes or answer questions. Additional imaging studies were performed.\nDr. Theodore T. Pierce: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed no abnormalities. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse hepatic steatosis, as well as mucosal hyperenhancement and submucosal edema involving portions of the small and large bowel, with relative sparing of the distal jejunum, proximal ileum, descending colon, and sigmoid colon.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Abdomen and Pelvis.\nDr. Bobkowski: Treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was initiated. Six hours after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, the blood pressure decreased to 85/45 mm Hg, and the heart rate increased to 132 beats per minute. There was no response to painful stimuli. Myoclonic jerking movements were observed. Treatment with norepinephrine was initiated, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The trachea was intubated for airway protection, and sedation with propofol and dexmedetomidine was initiated. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was continued; prescribed medications of carbamazepine, a multivitamin, omeprazole, selenium, sucralfate, thiamine, topiramate, and zinc sulfate were administered.\nOn the first hospital day, the blood pressure increased, and vasopressors and sedative medications were discontinued. The patient had no spontaneous interaction or speech production. She did not follow commands or grimace in response to noxious stimuli. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The corneal reflexes were intact, as were the cough and gag reflexes. There was no spontaneous movement of the arms or legs, but they withdrew in response to pain; the deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The results of CT of the head were normal. Sedation was not resumed, and serial neurologic examinations were performed.\nOn the second hospital day, leukocytosis had resolved, but the patient\u2019s mental status had not improved. Electroencephalography (EEG) with long-term monitoring revealed near-continuous generalized periodic discharges with triphasic morphologic features, often with superimposed rhythmic activity. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head were normal, as were the results of magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck. Lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed normal protein levels and no nucleated cells. The urine culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. The blood and stool cultures were negative, as was a stool test for Clostridioides difficile and an examination of the stool for ova and parasites. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was stopped, and treatment with ciprofloxacin was started.\nOn the third hospital day, the patient\u2019s mental status had not improved. EGD showed a small scar at the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. The results of flexible sigmoidoscopy were normal. Biopsy specimens of the jejunum and descending colon showed normal mucosa.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Yousef R. Badran: A 72-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of heartburn, nausea, and the inability to eat solid and liquid food.\nThe patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The symptoms had been well controlled with the use of daily omeprazole therapy until 11 months before this admission, when heartburn recurred despite treatment. At that time, the patient also noticed nausea after eating and early satiation. During the next 9 months, the heartburn and nausea slowly increased in severity. To help manage his symptoms, the patient adjusted his diet from solid food to soft solid food.\nTwo months before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at the gastroenterology clinic of another hospital. The glycated hemoglobin level was 6.1% (reference range, 4.3 to 5.6). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. Although the patient had not eaten food for 24 hours before the procedure, the stomach could not be adequately visualized because there was a large amount of residual food; no intraluminal masses were seen.\nA scintigraphy study of gastric emptying was performed. During the study, 88% of the gastric contents were retained at 1 hour, 88% at 2 hours, 81% at 3 hours, and 80% at 4 hours. In a patient with normal gastric emptying, less than 60% of the gastric contents would be retained at 2 hours and less than 10% at 4 hours. Thus, the results were consistent with severely delayed gastric emptying. The patient was told that he had idiopathic gastroparesis and underwent trials of several medications. Ondansetron caused constipation, erythromycin caused burning while swallowing and abdominal cramping, and metoclopramide and scopolamine did not lead to a decrease in the patient\u2019s symptoms.\nDuring the 2 months after the evaluation in the gastroenterology clinic, the patient adjusted his diet from soft solid food to blended solid food. Two weeks before this admission, he adjusted his diet to primarily liquid food, such as nutritional supplement drinks, protein shakes, and ice cream. When the patient was no longer able to drink liquids, he sought evaluation at the emergency department of the other hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient described epigastric burning and nausea after eating. He had lost 13.6 kg of weight in the preceding year, including 5.4 kg in the past 2 weeks. He had no recent history of illness, night sweats, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.\nDr. David A. Rosman: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a patulous esophagus, along with wall thickening in scattered areas of the upper and lower segments of the esophagus. There was abnormal circumferential wall thickening (\u226413 mm) in the stomach, particularly at the antrum, incisura, and pyloric canal (Figure 1). The antrum was decompressed or nonexpansile, and the rest of the stomach was distended. There were multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules (\u22645 mm in diameter) and multiple hepatic hypodensities (<10 mm in diameter), as well as a pancreatic cyst (5 mm in diameter) and an exophytic renal lesion (8 mm in diameter).\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT Scan of the Abdomen.\nDr. Badran: A nasogastric tube was inserted. Treatment with intravenous pantoprazole was started, and intravenous lorazepam was administered for nausea. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nDuring the subsequent week, the patient received vitamin and mineral supplements for severe malnutrition. He remained unable to drink liquids. On the 7th hospital day, a peripherally inserted central catheter was placed, and total parenteral nutrition was administered. The patient was monitored for refeeding syndrome. On the 15th hospital day, he was transferred to this hospital for further treatment.\nOn transfer to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had a history of prediabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diverticulosis, glaucoma, and basal cell carcinoma of the ear that had been resected. Five years before this admission, EGD had revealed a widely patent Schatzki\u2019s ring, an irregular-appearing Z line, and a few gastric polyps; examination of an esophageal biopsy specimen had revealed no abnormalities. Colonoscopy had shown two tubular adenomas. The patient had undergone orthognathic surgery, but there was no history of abdominal surgery. Medications included omeprazole, lisinopril, atorvastatin, vitamin D supplements, and bimatoprost and bromonidine eye drops. Sulfa drugs had caused a rash.\nThe patient lived with his wife in a rural area of New England. He had previously served in the military and currently worked as a biotechnologist. He had never smoked tobacco, and he drank alcohol rarely. His mother and paternal aunt had died of colon cancer, his father of lung cancer, his maternal grandmother of breast cancer, and his maternal grandfather of prostate cancer. His two children and two grandchildren were healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was thin and had a nasogastric tube in place. He had normal mood, affect, and insight. The abdomen was flat, soft, and nondistended, with mild tenderness in the epigastrium on palpation. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Distal sensory and motor function were normal.

Ravicz (Pediatrics): A 20-year-old man with bipolar disorder was transferred to this hospital because of hemoptysis and hypoxemia.\nEleven months before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Six weeks before the current presentation, he was taken to another hospital for evaluation of racing thoughts, generalized hyperactivity, and difficulty sleeping. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. During the admission, the patient was involved in an altercation and was struck on the left side of the chest; pain subsequently developed in that area. Five weeks before the current presentation, chest pain persisted, and nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite developed. The patient was transported from the psychiatric hospital to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Teresa Victoria: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies.\nDr. Ravicz: The patient was told that he had a pulmonary contusion and was transported back to the psychiatric hospital. The dosages of quetiapine and paliperidone were increased. Four weeks before the current presentation, the patient had urticaria and intermittent nausea; a single dose of methylprednisolone was administered. Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged home.\nTen days before the current presentation, chest pain continued, cough developed, and nausea increased in severity. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a second hospital. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest (Figure 1B) revealed a consolidation in the left lower lobe and a left pleural effusion.\nDr. Ravicz: A course of doxycycline was started for the treatment of presumed pneumonia, and the patient was discharged home. During the subsequent 6 days, the cough and chest pain abated. Four days before the current presentation, the course of doxycycline was completed. During the next several days, the cough increased in severity and became productive of yellow sputum with dark-red streaks, and shortness of breath developed; nausea also increased in severity. One day before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated again in the emergency department of the second hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient appeared ill and had difficulty breathing.

There were wedge-shaped opacities without enhancement in the left upper and lower lobes, findings consistent with infarction. There were small pleural effusions that were larger on the left side than on the right side.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies Obtained on Current Presentation.\nDr. Ravicz: Treatment with enoxaparin, vancomycin, and cefepime was started, and intravenous fluids were administered. The patient was admitted to the second hospital. On hospital day 2, the oxygen saturation decreased, and supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula. Blood cultures showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional evaluation and treatment.\nOn admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and nausea continued. The patient reported fatigue and weight loss that had started after the injury to the chest. He had also noticed discoloration in his fingers that was associated with changes in temperature. There was no headache, abdominal pain, or joint pain.\nThe patient had a history of asthma, migraines, and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. Bipolar disorder had been diagnosed when he was hospitalized for mania, grandiose thoughts, and paranoid delusions. Medications included quetiapine, paliperidone, and methylphenidate. Sulfa drugs and valproate had caused rash, nausea, and vomiting. The patient had previously been sexually active with female partners. He drank alcohol rarely and vaped marijuana frequently; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother, maternal aunt, paternal aunt, and paternal uncle had depression.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 89/40 mm Hg, the heart rate 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The right lung was clear on auscultation, but the left lung had diminished sounds. There was no abdominal tenderness, joint swelling, or rash. The patient had a flat affect, apathy, grandiose thoughts, poverty of speech and thought, and psychomotor retardation. There was no evidence of paranoia or hallucinations. The hemoglobin level was 8.7 g per deciliter and the albumin level 1.6 g per deciliter.

Dudzinski: A 76-year-old man was evaluated in the intensive care unit of this hospital for persistent postoperative cardiogenic shock and new diffuse rash after undergoing mitral-valve replacement.\nTwo months before this evaluation, the patient was admitted to another hospital with anorexia, generalized weakness, fatigue, and edema. Examination of the lungs was notable for decreased breath sounds and basilar crackles. The level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide was 15,895 pg per milliliter (reference value, <1500).\nDr. Matthew T. Stib: A chest radiograph (Figure 1A) showed a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette, as well as evidence of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCardiac and Radiographic Studies.\nDr. Dudzinski: At the other hospital, intravenous furosemide was administered. Blood cultures obtained at the time of admission grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in four of four bottles. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) reportedly revealed moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and a 7-mm vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Treatment with intravenous oxacillin was initiated; a 4-week course of treatment was planned, after which the patient was scheduled for follow-up in the cardiac surgery clinic at this hospital.\nHowever, 3 weeks after discharge, the patient reported dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, progressive edema of the legs, and weight gain of 7 kg. He was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nMedical history was notable for hypertension, right bundle-branch block, hypothyroidism, and prostatism, as well as atrial fibrillation, for which the patient had undergone cardioversion. Surgical history included tooth extraction for a painful dental abscess 6 weeks before admission to the other hospital, appendectomy, arthroplasty of the left hip after a fall 3 years earlier, and repair of a meniscus tear in the left knee. Medications included oxacillin administered intravenously every 4 hours and oral furosemide, sotalol, rivaroxaban, levothyroxine, and tamsulosin. He had had no known adverse drug reactions.\nThe patient was retired and lived with his spouse. He reported that, before his admission to the other hospital, he had been riding a bicycle a few miles several times per week. He had previously smoked cigarettes but had quit 30 years earlier; he consumed one beer weekly and used no other substances. His family history was notable for atrial fibrillation.\nThe temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 83 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued. The jugular venous pressure was elevated, at 15 cm of water. The cardiac impulse was discrete and was not displaced. Auscultation of the chest revealed an irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm, with a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex that did not change with respiration, and bibasilar crackles. There was 2+ pitting edema in the legs. A peripherally inserted central catheter was present in the right arm.\nThe blood levels of calcium, magnesium, albumin, lipase, glycated hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, and a screening test for human immunodeficiency virus antigen and antibodies was negative.

The tip of a peripherally inserted central catheter was appropriately positioned in the lower superior vena cava.\nDr. Dudzinski: Treatment with intravenous oxacillin and furosemide was continued. TEE (Figure 1D) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a normal-sized left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 61%, dilatation of the right ventricle with normal function, dilatation of both atria, mitral-valve perforation and thickening, severe mitral regurgitation due to mitral-valve perforation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with a right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg (also see Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Coronary angiography revealed 70% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and 90% stenosis in the middle right coronary artery.\nOn hospital day 11, cardiac surgery was performed. The patient underwent bioprosthetic mitral-valve replacement, along with two-vessel coronary-artery bypass grafting and amputation of the left atrial appendage. TEE performed after the surgical procedure revealed a well-seated mitral prosthesis with trace central regurgitation, as well as mild biventricular systolic dysfunction. Subsequently, on transfer to the intensive care unit, the blood pressure was 108/52 mm Hg and the cardiac index 3.0 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area while the patient was receiving epinephrine (at a rate of 2 \u03bcg per minute), norepinephrine (10 \u03bcg per minute), and vasopressin (0.04 U per minute). An electrocardiogram (Figure 1E) showed atrial fibrillation, right bundle-branch block, and ventricular premature beats. During postoperative day 1, the patient had increased ventricular ectopy and a 25-beat run of ventricular tachycardia. Laboratory and hemodynamic data are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Stib: An anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure 1F) showed left atrial enlargement, bilateral pulmonary edema, and basilar atelectasis, along with sternotomy wires, an endotracheal tube, a catheter in the right main pulmonary artery, bilateral chest tubes, and a mediastinal drain.\nDr. Dudzinski: Treatment with intravenous amiodarone was started, and the epinephrine infusion was discontinued.\nOn postoperative day 2, the trachea was extubated, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued. The cardiac index had decreased to less than 2.0 liters per minute per square meter, and intravenous milrinone was initiated. The next day, a 35-beat run of ventricular tachycardia occurred. On postoperative day 4, given that the cardiac index was less than 1.9 liters per minute per square meter, intravenous dopamine was started. On postoperative day 5, deep-vein thrombosis was identified in the right lower leg, and treatment with warfarin was started. A truncal macular rash was noted. TTE revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 32%, right ventricular dysfunction, atrial dilatation, trace central prosthetic mitral regurgitation with a mean transmitral gradient of 5 mm Hg measured at 70 beats per minute, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (see Video 3). There was also worsening renal function. Milrinone was stopped and epinephrine initiated.\nOn postoperative day 8, microbiologic cultures obtained during the surgical procedure showed no growth; the patient\u2019s oxacillin treatment was switched to cefazolin. During the next few days, the rash became more confluent and extended to the face, back, arms, and neck in addition to the trunk, but there was no mucosal involvement. Examination of the joints was normal, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. The arms and legs were cool, and urine output had decreased, despite continued therapy with intravenous epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Repeat TTE on postoperative day 13 revealed borderline left ventricular dilatation with an ejection fraction of 37%, right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.\nAdditional diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Marina Avetisyan (Neurology, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital): A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of rapidly progressive weakness in the right arm and recurrent falls.\nTwelve years before this admission, the patient noted worsening gait and balance disturbance, which slowly progressed, and falls began to occur 5 years before this admission. Her medical history included measles encephalitis, which had been diagnosed when she was 6 years of age and had resulted in weakness on the left side, severe vision and hearing impairment, and gait and balance disturbance. After rehabilitation therapy, her balance and gait apparently normalized, but she had mild residual weakness on the left side, which resulted in a change from left-hand to right-hand dominance.\nTwo years before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She reported difficulties with balance, which worsened with head turning. She reported no disequilibrium, vertigo, back pain, paresthesia, or numbness. On examination, her cognitive function was intact, and although her speech was dysarthric and hypophonic, these abnormalities could have been associated with her hearing loss. The cranial-nerve examination revealed abnormal eye movements, with square-wave jerks, saccadic pursuit, and bilateral horizontal nystagmus. The hearing and vision were severely reduced. The muscle bulk was decreased throughout, and tone was normal. Motor strength was full and symmetric in the arms and legs bilaterally, and contractures were present in the fingers of the left hand. Reflexes were reduced or absent throughout, and plantar reflexes were extensor bilaterally. Vibratory sensation was reduced at the great toes but was otherwise normal. The patient had appendicular dysmetria on both finger-to-nose testing and heel-to-shin testing that was greater on the left side than on the right side. Her gait was wide-based, and she was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg sign was present.\nNeedle electromyographic findings and the results of nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine revealed mild multilevel degenerative disk disease without clinically significant spinal-canal stenosis. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 0 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and oligoclonal bands were absent. Tests of the CSF and serum for antibodies associated with autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis were negative (Table 1).

The patient initially attributed the weakness to fatigue, since it had occurred during a time of increased physical activity associated with moving to a different apartment. However, the weakness did not abate, and 2 months before this admission, she was again evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She noted difficulty with communicating in sign language and with holding objects in her right hand because of weakness and had started using her left hand to eat. She reported no neck, arm, or leg pain and no sensory loss. Her gait and balance were stable, with no recent falls.\nOn examination, there was reduced facial expression and reduced muscle bulk and tone throughout. The right shoulder was dropped, with weakness in the right trapezius and reduced active shoulder abduction that was limited to 70 degrees, without pain on shoulder abduction. There was predominantly proximal weakness in the right arm; the muscle strength was 4\u2212/5 on shoulder abduction and external rotation, 4+/5 on elbow flexion, and 4/5 on elbow extension, wrist extension, and abductor digiti minimi and finger extension. The strength in the right leg was normal. There was subtle weakness on the left side that involved wrist and finger extension and great toe extension. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right biceps and 1+ at the left biceps and were otherwise areflexic throughout. Sensation was intact in the arms, but there was decreased vibratory sensation and proprioception at the great toes; sensation was otherwise normal. Moderate appendicular dysmetria was present in the arms and legs. The patient\u2019s gait, which was assessed while she was using her white cane (the type of cane commonly used by blind or visually impaired persons), was wide-based; she took excessively large steps and reached out once to touch the wall. Neurologic examination was otherwise unchanged from the examination performed 2 years earlier. Additional studies were obtained.\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was reported to be normal. MRI of the cervical spine was also performed without the administration of contrast material; T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed signal hyperintensity in the suboccipital and paraspinal soft tissues that was consistent with edema. Areas of intrinsic hyperintense signal that were consistent with fatty atrophy were seen on T1-weighted imaging. There were diffuse degenerative changes with mild spinal-canal stenosis at C4\u2013C5, without cord compression.\nDr. Avetisyan: Repeat needle electromyography revealed no recorded motor units in the right deltoid or infraspinatus muscles, with complex repetitive discharges in the right cervical paraspinal and deltoid muscles. Nerve-conduction studies revealed mild reduction in the amplitudes of the bilateral median and right ulnar sensory responses; the sensory responses of the right radial, bilateral antebrachial cutaneous, and bilateral medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves were normal, as were the motor responses of the right median and right ulnar nerves.\nDuring the ensuing 2 months, the weakness in the right arm progressed rapidly, which caused the patient to have difficulty ambulating with her white cane (she was unable to walk with a standard cane), making walking unsafe after frequent falls and rendering her practically bedbound. She had no pain or numbness in her arm. She was ultimately unable to care for herself at home and was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation.\nOther medical history included hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism. Medications included ascorbic acid, vitamin B complex, coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, calcium carbonate and cholecalciferol, and levothyroxine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone and worked for a nonprofit agency. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank four glasses of wine per week, and did not use illicit drugs. She reported that her father had died from Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease when he was 71 years of age, 7 months after the onset of symptoms. Her mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which was diagnosed when she was in her 60s; she was currently living in a nursing home. The patient had four siblings; one had died at 46 years of age from an intracerebral hemorrhage, and her remaining three siblings were well.\nOn examination, the temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/64 mm Hg, the pulse 61 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 15.8. The patient appeared emaciated but was able to sit up in a chair and hold her head up. Strength in her right arm had decreased to 2/5 on shoulder shrug, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, and elbow extension, with 3/5 strength on wrist extension and finger flexion and extension. There was new proximal weakness in the right leg, with 4/5 strength on right hip flexion. The strength in the left arm was unchanged. Deep-tendon reflexes were 3+ at the right biceps and 2+ at the brachioradialis and were otherwise absent throughout. She had ataxia as well as occasional jerks that involved the legs (with the left leg affected to a greater extent than the right leg) and were possibly stimulus-induced. The remainder of the neurologic examination was unchanged from the last visit.\nDr. Schaefer: MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a new linear signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging but also a marked decrease in subtle restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging and hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging (identified in retrospect on the previous MRI) in the left frontal and left parietal lobes (Figure 1). MRI of the whole spine, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was unchanged from previous imaging.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Avetisyan: The creatine kinase level was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed.",

On presentation to the emergency department, she reported fatigue, dizziness, abdominal pain, and pain and numbness in her left lower leg. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 (on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating greater alteration of consciousness). On examination, the heart rate was 134 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute while the patient was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was notable for mild conjunctival pallor and swelling in the inferior left lower leg, which had been tied with a tourniquet. The leg was tender with ecchymosis, and two fang marks were visible on the left foot (Figure 1). The patient had diffuse pain in the lower abdomen, intermittent contractions, and vaginal bleeding. Fetal movement was detected on palpation. The fetal heart rate was 112 beats per minute; ultrasonography was not available. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nFIGURE 1\n\nPhotograph of the Left Foot.\nThe hemoglobin level was 7.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 11.5 to 15.0), the urea nitrogen level 145 mg per deciliter (51.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 15 to 45 mg per deciliter [5.4 to 16.1 mmol per liter]), the creatinine level 8.9 mg per deciliter (786.8 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [53.0 to 114.9 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the platelet count 36,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000).

    "user_input": "Dr. Abigail L. Donovan: A 13-year-old boy with a history of attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of worsening depression, thoughts of self-injurious behavior, and suicidality.\nThe patient had a history of impulsivity and frequent episodes of self-injury, such as head-butting and cutting, which sometimes occurred while he was in treatment settings. Twelve months before the current presentation, he began to have suicidal ideation, with occasional suicidal planning and a suicide attempt. During the next year, the patient had 10 evaluations in the emergency department and six inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations.\nOne day before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from an inpatient psychiatric hospital, where he had been admitted and treated for 3 weeks because of urges to hurt himself. On the day of the current presentation, the patient visited his middle school and participated in therapy at home. Throughout the day, he noticed worsening depression and had recurrent thoughts of self-injury and suicide. He asked his parents to call emergency medical services because he felt unsafe in his home. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn arrival, the patient was in an agitated and combative state, reporting that he had changed his mind and no longer wanted to be in the hospital. Attempts at verbal deescalation were not effective. Treatment with intramuscular olanzapine was administered, and physical restraints were placed on his arms and legs. During the next 6 hours, the agitation decreased, and the physical restraints were removed. Additional history was obtained but was limited because the patient shrugged his shoulders in response to most questions. He described the school visit as difficult and uncomfortable. He did not indicate why he felt unsafe in his home; he reported that he had picked at scabs on his arms and legs in order to hurt himself and had ongoing suicidal ideation. The patient also reported difficulty sleeping and concentrating, as well as loss of interest and motivation, although he still enjoyed playing sports. He had no homicidal ideation, paranoid thoughts, or delusions.\nMedications included extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He lived in an urban area of New Hampshire with his mother, father, and sister.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 133/78 mm Hg, the heart rate 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared disheveled. There were scattered cuts and wounds in varying stages of healing on both arms. The patient was in a disengaged and agitated state. He had a depressed mood, a guarded affect, and difficulty concentrating. His speech was slow and soft, with reduced prosody. His thought process was logical and linear; the thought content was notable for suicidal ideation. He had no loosening of associations, delusions, or hallucinations. Insight and judgment were poor.\nThe patient was deemed to be at high risk for harm and was transferred to the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department. Transfer to an inpatient psychiatric hospital was requested, but no beds were available at any facility in the region. During the next 6 weeks, while the patient was awaiting admission to an inpatient psychiatric hospital, treatment with extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone was continued, and treatment with sertraline, diphenhydramine, and melatonin was initiated. He had frequent episodes of agitation, which led to the administration of oral clonidine or oral or intramuscular olanzapine as needed. He also had several episodes of self-injury; surveillance was heightened, with well-being checks performed every 15 minutes.\nOn day 41 in the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department, agitation developed, and a dose of oral olanzapine was administered in addition to scheduled medications. One hour later, agitation continued, and a dose of intramuscular olanzapine was administered. After the administration of intramuscular olanzapine, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 119/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air.\nThe next morning, the blood pressure was 146/87 mm Hg and the heart rate 52 beats per minute. There were no new symptoms; the examination was unchanged. Twelve hours later, the blood pressure was 69/39 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. The patient reported malaise and lightheadedness with standing, as well as nausea and abdominal pain. He appeared pale, tired, and lethargic. Oral rehydration was encouraged. One hour later, the blood pressure was 94/50 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. Three hours after the onset of hypotension, the blood pressure was 79/45 mm Hg and the heart rate 85 beats per minute.\nBlood and urine toxicologic screening was negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A blood specimen was obtained for culture. Intravenous fluids, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone were administered. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities.

    "user_input": "Dr. Kathy M. Tran (Medicine): A 21-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of fatigue, weight gain, and abdominal pain.\nThe patient had been well until 4 months before the current evaluation, when an episode of dull, aching pain in the right lower quadrant occurred. The pain lasted for a few hours before resolving spontaneously. During the next 4 months, episodes of abdominal pain continued to occur and increased in duration, frequency, and severity. The patient sought evaluation in the gynecology clinic of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient described the pain as variable, rating it between 3 and 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The episodes of pain occurred daily and lasted for up to 20 hours. The pain decreased with sitting or lying down and did not increase with movement; it was not associated with her menstrual period. The patient also reported fatigue, irritability, and weight gain of 4.5 kg in the previous 4 months despite increased exercise and decreased food intake.\nThere was a history of hypothyroidism, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and migraines. The patient had never been pregnant and had no known history of sexually transmitted infections or abnormal results on screening tests for cervical cancer. She had previously been sexually active with male partners, but she reported no current sexual activity. She had taken oral contraceptives for 2 years but had stopped taking them 6 months before this evaluation, when a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) was placed. Other medications included levothyroxine, citalopram, and multivitamins; there were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived with roommates in an urban area of New England. She was a former athlete and worked as a research scientist. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her mother, coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia in her father, breast cancer and diabetes in her paternal grandmother, and lung cancer in her paternal grandfather.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 119/73 mm Hg and the heart rate 62 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The thyroid was firm on palpation, with a small nodule noted on the right side. The abdomen was nondistended, soft, and nontender. A small hernia with a thrill was noted at the right inguinal ring. A speculum examination of the vagina and cervix was normal; IUD strings were visible at the cervical os. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes and glucose and results of tests for kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis were negative. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Madeleine Sertic: Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass (measuring 4.8 cm by 5.0 cm by 3.9 cm) along the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe (Figure 1A). The uterus, ovaries, and adnexa were normal. There was no free fluid in the pelvis, and the IUD was in an appropriate position.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a right adrenal mass (measuring 4.5 cm by 4.7 cm by 4.0 cm) that was T2 isointense (Figure 1B) and T1 hypointense. The mass had diffusion restriction (Figure 1C), as well as early enhancement with washout, which refers to the temporal reduction in the enhancement of a lesion. The features were indeterminate and were not definitively diagnostic of adrenal adenoma or another adrenal lesion, such as pheochromocytoma or adrenocortical carcinoma.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis again revealed a right adrenal mass, which had a density of 33 Hounsfield units (HU) before the administration of contrast material (Figure 1D), 74 HU during the portal-venous phase (Figure 1E), and 45 HU during the 15-minute delayed phase (Figure 1F). The absolute washout was calculated as 71%. The absolute washout is calculated by dividing the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the delayed-phase density by the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the unenhanced density and then converting the result to a percentage: [(HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU delayed phase) / (HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU unenhanced)] \u00d7 100. Adrenal adenomas tend to wash out faster than other adrenal lesions, and an absolute washout of more than 60% is highly suggestive of an adrenal adenoma. However, lesions larger than 4 cm are likely to be malignant, regardless of the washout characteristics.1 There was also a thin-walled cyst (measuring 3.3 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the left lung.\nDr. Tran: The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Additional laboratory tests were performed to further evaluate the adrenal mass. Blood levels of renin and aldosterone were normal, as were urinary levels of catecholamines and metanephrines. An overnight, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed. The baseline blood corticotropin level was 3 pg per milliliter (0.7 pmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 76 pg per milliliter [1.3 to 16.7 pmol per liter]). At 11 p.m., dexamethasone (1 mg) was administered; at 8 a.m., the blood cortisol level was 9.1 \u03bcg per deciliter (251 nmol per liter; reference value, <1.8 \u03bcg per deciliter [50 nmol per liter]), and the concurrent blood dexamethasone level was 631 ng per deciliter (reference range, 140 to 295). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 31.0 \u03bcg (reference range, 3.5 to 45.0); the blood levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were normal.\nManagement decisions were made.",

On evaluation, the patient felt well. He had no fever, shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, headache, vision changes, oral ulcers, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, arthralgias, or rash. He reported no recent illnesses.\nThe patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Three years before this evaluation, chest radiography and abdominal ultrasonography, performed at his request because of a family history of cancer, had reportedly shown no abnormalities. The patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He worked in the finance industry and had previously been a health care worker. He was born in northern South America and had moved to southern Central America 5 years earlier. He lived in an urban area with his wife, son, and dog.\nThe patient had visited nearly every country in North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. Four years earlier, he had traveled by motorcycle from Alaska to Panama; 6 months earlier, he had traveled by motorcycle from Colombia to Chile. The patient had also traveled to several countries in western and eastern Europe, northern Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific Islands. He had a physically active lifestyle that included weight lifting and bicycling at least four times per week. He had smoked two cigarettes daily and one cigar every 3 months for 2 years. His family history of cancer included breast cancer in his mother, prostate and pancreatic cancers in his father, cancer of unknown primary origin in his maternal grandfather, and ovarian cancer in his paternal grandmother.\nOn evaluation, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 133/82 mm Hg, the pulse 68 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.1. He appeared well, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. There was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The white-cell count was 6970 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the hemoglobin level 12.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the platelet count 213,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Results of kidney-function, liver-function, and coagulation tests were normal.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Man Piu Wong: A 55-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital after a witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\nThe patient had been eating at a restaurant late at night when he lost consciousness. A first responder used an automated external defibrillator to deliver a shock, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. Four minutes later, emergency medical services identified ventricular fibrillation, and defibrillation was performed. Intravenous amiodarone and epinephrine and intranasal naloxone were administered. Unstable ventricular tachycardia occurred, and the patient underwent cardioversion. He was transported to the emergency department of this hospital. The results of electrocardiography (ECG) performed before arrival at the hospital were suggestive of inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.\nA review of systems could not be performed. The patient had no known medical history. He was not known to take any medications. He reportedly lived alone, worked in the service industry, and did not use tobacco or drink alcohol. His family history was unknown.\nOn the patient\u2019s arrival at the emergency department, the heart rate was 123 beats per minute, the blood pressure 188/107 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a bag\u2013valve\u2013mask device at a rate of 15 liters per minute. The weight was 73 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.0. The patient was awake but not oriented. He did not spontaneously move the arms or legs or respond to tactile stimuli; he had increased work of breathing and posturing. The pupils were 3 mm in diameter and sluggishly reactive. Auscultation revealed sinus tachycardia and diffuse lung crackles. There was no leg edema. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nDr. Ada C. Stefanescu Schmidt: ECG showed sinus tachycardia, Q waves and 2-mm ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads, and upsloping ST-segment depressions in the lateral and precordial leads (Figure 1A).\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Cardiopulmonary Diagnostic Studies.\nDr. Wong: Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The white-cell count and differential count were normal, as were the levels of magnesium, bilirubin, and globulin. The high-sensitivity troponin T level was 3169 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14), and the N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level was 5679 pg per milliliter (reference value, <900).

The trachea was intubated, and the oxygen saturation was 88% while the patient was receiving mechanical ventilation on a volume-controlled mode (tidal volume, 440 ml; respiratory rate, 20 breaths per minute; positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP], 14 cm of water; fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio2], 1.0).\nDr. Milena Petranovic: Portable chest radiography (Figure 1B) revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, as well as diffuse interstitial opacities in both lungs and an asymmetric consolidation in the right upper lobe. Endotracheal and enteric tubes were in appropriate positions, and multiple metallic densities related to a previous gunshot injury were projected over the left hemithorax.\nDr. Stefanescu Schmidt: Unstable ventricular tachycardia recurred, and defibrillation was performed. Emergency cardiac catheterization was performed, and a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was placed through the right femoral artery. Coronary angiography (Figure 1C) revealed a thrombotic occlusion of the right coronary artery, as well as 60 to 70% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and a diagonal branch. The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 34 mm Hg. Intraprocedural transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed a dilated, hypokinetic left ventricle with akinesis of the inferior and septal walls. Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation were present, and there was no pericardial effusion.\nThe thrombosis of the right coronary artery was difficult to wire and cross. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was undertaken with the use of two drug-eluting stents in the middle and distal portions of the right coronary artery. Ventricular tachycardia recurred before reperfusion, and the patient underwent two cardioversions. Intravenous cangrelor, heparin, amiodarone, vancomycin, and cefepime were administered. Data from pulmonary artery catheterization, performed after PCI, are shown in Table 2. After the initiation of treatment with the percutaneous LVAD and reperfusion of the right coronary artery, the patient received low-dose norepinephrine.\nTABLE 2\n\nData from Invasive Hemodynamic Monitoring and Pulse Oximetry.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Initial Evaluation (Hospital Day 1), During Cardiac Catheterization (Hospital Day 1), On CICU Admission (Hospital Day 2), 6 Hr after CICU Admission (Hospital Day 2), 14 Hr after CICU Admission (Hospital Day 2)\nCentral venous pressure (mm Hg): 0\u20136, \u2014, 18, 17, 17, 15  \nRight ventricular pressure (mm Hg):  \n  Systolic: 20\u201330, \u2014, 68, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014  \n  End diastolic: 0\u20136, \u2014, 15, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014  \nPulmonary artery pressure (mm Hg):  \n  Systolic: 15\u201330, \u2014, 69, 52, 30, 42  \n  Diastolic: 6\u201315, \u2014, 29, 22, 15, 11  \n  Mean: 8\u201320, \u2014, 44, 33, 22, 22  \nPulmonary capillary wedge pressure (mm Hg): 6\u201314, \u2014, 20, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014  \nPulmonary artery pulsatility index: \u2014, \u2014, 2.2, 1.8, 0.9, 2.1  \nCentral venous oxygen saturation (%): 70.0\u201380.0, \u2014, 56.6, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014  \nMixed venous oxygen saturation (%): 65.0\u201375.0, \u2014, 76.8, \u2014, 76.5, 90.1  \nArterial oxygen saturation (%): 94.0\u201399.0, 91.5, 93.0, 94.2, 96.9, 99.1  \nCardiac output by thermodilution (liters/min): 4.0\u20138.0, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 3.0, 5.4  \nCardiac index by thermodilution (liters/min/m\u00b2): 2.4\u20134.0, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.7, 3.0\u2020  \n\n\nDr. Wong: The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit early on the morning of the second hospital day. The temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 98 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 81/72 mm Hg while he was receiving intravenous norepinephrine at a rate of 4 \u03bcg per minute and maximal support from the percutaneous LVAD. The oxygen saturation was 92% while he was receiving mechanical ventilation on a volume-controlled mode. The heart sounds were tachycardic and distant and were obscured by the mechanical hum of the LVAD. There was bleeding at the site of the right femoral arteriotomy. The arms and legs were cool. When sedation was temporarily discontinued, the pupils were sluggishly reactive, without corneal reflexes or blinking in response to threat; there was no response to noxious stimuli, and the plantar reflexes were mute.\nA screening test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was positive, and intravenous dexamethasone and remdesivir were administered. Aspirin was also administered. Results from laboratory testing and hemodynamic monitoring are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. The protocol for temperature management after cardiac arrest was initiated.\nDr. Petranovic: Chest radiography showed that the endotracheal tube, cardiac catheter, percutaneous LVAD, and enteric tube were in appropriate positions. There were diffuse alveolar opacities, which were greater on the left side than the right side, as well as a left pleural effusion.\nDr. Wong: During the 6 hours after admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, the blood pressure decreased to 74/72 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous norepinephrine at a rate of 9 \u03bcg per minute and maximal support from the percutaneous LVAD. The urine output decreased, and the cardiac index measured by means of thermodilution was 1.7 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area; other results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Treatment with intravenous epinephrine was initiated at a rate of 2 \u03bcg per minute. The oxygen saturation was 81% while he was receiving mechanical ventilation; intravenous cisatracurium and inhaled nitric oxide were administered.\nBy the afternoon, the patient was anuric. On examination, there was a systolic murmur, and the arms and legs remained cool and were mottled. He received doses of intravenous epinephrine at a rate of up to 5 \u03bcg per minute, and the blood pressure was 70/66 mm Hg.

    "user_input": "Dr. Michael D. Kritzer: A 57-year-old woman with major depressive disorder and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was evaluated at a hospital affiliated with this hospital because she was having delusions that she was dead.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 weeks before this presentation, when myalgias, cough, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting developed. She sought evaluation at the primary care clinic of an academic medical center affiliated with this hospital (the two hospitals are part of the same health care system). Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, and the patient was instructed to quarantine at home. She lived with her father and assisted him with activities of daily living; he also received a diagnosis of Covid-19.\nDuring the following week, the patient\u2019s cough persisted, and new shortness of breath developed. Her symptoms worsened; she felt that she was unable to take care of her father. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient and her father were taken to the emergency department of the other hospital, where they were both admitted for worsening Covid-19 pneumonia. The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. Treatment with remdesivir was stopped on hospital day 4 when the blood aminotransferase levels increased to three times the upper limit of the normal range.\nDuring the hospitalization, the patient was noted to have intermittent anxiety, particularly when discharge planning for her father was discussed. She and her brother declined to have their father discharged to a rehabilitation center and instead planned for him to eventually return home to quarantine with the patient. On hospital day 6, the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation was normal while she was breathing ambient air, and the blood aminotransferase levels had improved. She was discharged home with instructions to quarantine and continue taking dexamethasone.\nOne day after discharge, the patient\u2019s brother spoke to her on the telephone. He thought that she seemed to be confused and unable to take care of herself, and he asked her to return to the emergency department of the other hospital.\nOn evaluation in the emergency department, the patient explained that she was unsure why her brother had asked her to return to the hospital, and she said that she wanted to go home. She also expressed that she felt anxious about being home alone after discharge and overwhelmed about needing to care for her father at home once he was discharged from the hospital. The myalgias, cough, and shortness of breath had abated; she had no fevers, visual or auditory hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation.\nThe patient had a history of major depressive disorder, which had been diagnosed during the second decade of life. At the time of diagnosis, she had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and had received electroconvulsive therapy; thereafter, she had been discharged to a partial hospital program. She had been hospitalized for psychiatric symptoms twice since then, once for major depressive disorder and once for a mixed bipolar episode that was due to insomnia and anxious distress. The latter episode was associated with catatonic features and was treated with electroconvulsive therapy.\nThe patient had no history of suicidal or homicidal ideation or attempts and no history of violence. She had hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included dexamethasone, bupropion, fluoxetine, olanzapine, losartan, metformin, and pantoprazole. Sulfa drugs had caused angioedema, and lisinopril had caused cough. The patient was born in the Caribbean and had emigrated four decades earlier, first to southwestern Europe and then to the United States 2 years later. She lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with her father, who had mild dementia. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit substances.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 153/95 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented but guarded, with a flat affect. She appeared to be more anxious than she had been during the previous hospitalization. She paced around the room and perseverated about the care of her father. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 11,490 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000), with neutrophil predominance; the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Urinalysis and a radiograph of the chest were normal. Treatment with dexamethasone was stopped, and the patient was admitted to the hospital to facilitate discharge to a rehabilitation center for continued care.\nOn hospital day 3, the patient was noted to be more withdrawn, and she began responding to questions with one-word answers or silence. When she was encouraged to speak more, she continued to perseverate about the care of her father. When she was asked to elaborate on her concerns, she stated, \u201cHe is dead. I am dead.\u201d\nThe patient appeared disheveled, sullen, and anxious. She laid in bed motionless with her eyes open and looking forward, and she responded briefly to questions in a quiet voice with slowed speech. Her thoughts were perseverative and tangential. There was no evidence that she had loosening of associations, hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. She had poor insight and judgment. Memory, attention, concentration, abstract reasoning, and fund of knowledge were normal. When her arms and legs were lifted against gravity and released, they fell to the bed without resistance; with encouragement, she was able to move them. Muscle tone was normal, with no rigidity or waxy flexibility. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Aaron B. Paul: Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of an acute territorial infarct, intracranial mass, or hemorrhage. There was nonspecific moderate confluent hypoattenuation involving the supratentorial white matter.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Head.\nDr. Kritzer: Clonazepam was administered, and the dose of olanzapine was increased. Admission to an inpatient psychiatric unit was recommended. During the next week, while awaiting placement in an inpatient psychiatric unit, the patient continued to show signs of anxiety and a depressed mood. She said, \u201cI am dead. I do not exist. I am not real.\u201d She also believed that her father and brother, as well as her nurses and doctors, were dead. The patient was selectively mute and motionless, but she talked and moved with encouragement. She expressed that she felt directly responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic and asked to be thrown out of the window. She had the sensation that her bladder was gone and that she could not urinate, although she had been observed urinating independently. She felt that she could not eat, although she had been observed eating breakfast daily. On hospital day 9, the patient was transferred to the inpatient psychiatric unit of the other hospital.\nA diagnosis and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Kathleen M. McFadden (Medicine): A 22-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital in the summer before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic because of headache, fever, and respiratory failure.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 8 days before the current presentation, when nausea and myalgias developed. Over the next 2 days, chills, vomiting, neck pain, and headache with sonophobia developed. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital, where an evaluation reportedly showed dry mucous membranes but no signs of meningitis. The white-cell count was 12,300 per microliter (reference range, 4800 to 10,800), and the platelet count was 95,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Intravenous normal saline and morphine were administered, and the patient was discharged with supportive care for a presumed viral syndrome.\nDuring the next week, the patient had worsening headache and new photophobia, as well as malaise, anorexia, nonproductive cough, and dyspnea with minimal exertion. Two days before the current presentation, the patient\u2019s mother noticed episodes of confusion with nonsensical speech and excessive sleepiness, and she took the patient back to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported ongoing severe headaches and dyspnea. The temporal temperature was 38.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient had photophobia, but the neurologic examination was reportedly otherwise normal. She had mild throat erythema and diffuse abdominal tenderness with intermittent guarding. A urine test for beta human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained.\nTable 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed subarachnoid hemorrhage and diffuse ischemic changes in the parietal and temporal lobes. Lumbar puncture was deferred because of thrombocytopenia. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed diffuse interstitial lung markings, multiple opacities and nodules in the peripheral lung, two hypodensities in the peripheral spleen, and subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and doxycycline was administered. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital.\nThe next morning, screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus were negative, as was a blood-smear examination for parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Platelets were transfused, and intravenous normal saline was administered. The respiratory rate increased to 45 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 93% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 8 liters per minute; ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure was attempted, and intravenous furosemide was administered. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole were discontinued, and empirical treatment with intravenous meropenem and clindamycin was administered. The patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital.\nOn arrival at this hospital, the patient had confusion and tachypnea and thus provided a limited history, but family members provided additional information. The patient had a history of depression, for which she received citalopram. She had no known drug allergies. She worked in health care. She drank wine socially, used electronic cigarettes, and occasionally smoked marijuana but did not smoke tobacco. Her most recent travel had been to the Caribbean more than 1 year before the current presentation. She had no exposure to wooded or rural areas. Her family had dogs, but she had no bites or scratches; she had no other animal or insect exposures. There were no recent sexual contacts. Her mother had cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and her maternal grandmother had Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 103/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 49 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 8 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22. The patient appeared to be in respiratory distress, with accessory muscles used for breathing. She was oriented only after prompting. She had meningismus and concomitant rigidity of the shoulders with passive range of motion, but she had no focal cranial-nerve, strength, or sensory deficits. Auscultation of the lungs and heart revealed diffuse rales and rhonchi, as well as a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur that was loudest at the apex and left axilla and radiated to the sternum. The spleen tip was palpable. A small patch of petechiae was present on the upper chest. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of phosphorus, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; antinuclear antibodies were undetectable. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional blood cultures were obtained. Chest radiography showed diffuse lung opacities and pleural effusions on both sides. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia with normal intervals and nonspecific minor ST- and T-wave changes. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, doxycycline, and acyclovir was administered.\nFour hours after admission, increased work of breathing, tachypnea, and confusion progressed, and the trachea was intubated for initiation of mechanical ventilation. Intravenous propofol, hydromorphone, and phenylephrine were administered. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, revealing mildly bloody and frothy effluent from all the lobes of the lungs. On examination of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, the nucleated-cell count was 375 per microliter, with 77% neutrophils. Gram\u2019s staining showed no organisms. Tests for common respiratory virus \u2014 including influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses \u2014 were negative. A culture was also obtained.\nDr. Eric W. Zhang: CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral scattered curvilinear hyperdensities in the cortical sulci, findings suggestive of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (Figure 1A). There were also focal hypodense regions in the left superior parietal lobule and right temporal lobe with loss of normal gray\u2013white matter differentiation, findings suggestive of acute cortical infarcts (Figure 1B). CT pulmonary angiography showed evidence of mild interstitial edema, bilateral pleural effusions, and multifocal peribronchovascular nodular opacities and consolidations involving all the lobes of the lungs, some of which were peripherally distributed, without cavitation (Figure 1C). CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed several splenic hypodensities, which were most likely splenic infarcts, with accompanying mild ascites and mild periportal edema (Figure 1D).\nFigure 1\n\nCT and MRI Images.\nDr. McFadden: Platelets were transfused, and lumbar puncture was performed, with an opening pressure of 38 cm of water. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, the glucose level was 41 mg per deciliter (reference range, 50 to 75), the protein level 31 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), the red-cell count 2400 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and the nucleated-cell count 49 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 76% neutrophils, 16% monocytes, and 8% lymphocytes.\nDr. Zhang: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed multifocal subarachnoid sulcal hyperintensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, findings that can be seen with subarachnoid hemorrhage or acute meningitis (Figure 1E). The focal hypodense regions in the left superior parietal lobule and right temporal lobe that had been noted previously on CT were associated with restricted diffusion on an apparent-diffusion-coefficient map (Figure 1F) and on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure 1G) from MRI of the head, which is compatible with bilateral acute cortical infarcts.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Beatriz Rizkallah Alves (Neurology): A 71-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital for neurosurgical evaluation because of confusion, aphasia, and a mass lesion in the brain.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current presentation, when headache and fatigue developed. The next day, she was typing on a computer at her workplace when she suddenly noticed that her typed words were incoherent. The episode of confusion and language production difficulties resolved after a few minutes. Confusion recurred in the evening while the patient was at dinner with her husband, and she sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Examination was reportedly normal.\nDr. Jeremy N. Ford: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, and CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed a large area of attenuation in the left posterior superior frontal lobe.\nDr. Alves: The patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nDr. Ford: On hospital day 2, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left frontal lobe with vasogenic edema and mass effect. A diagnosis of cancer with metastases to the brain was considered, and additional imaging studies were obtained. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly showed a pulmonary nodule that measured 0.2 cm in diameter and a nodule in the right breast that measured 1.3 cm in diameter. The appearance of the breast nodule was unchanged from that observed on imaging performed 8 years before the current presentation, except for the presence of a new punctate calcification along the anterior margin.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head Obtained on Hospital Day 2.\nOn hospital day 3, expressive aphasia developed. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly showed increased edema and mass effect that corresponded to the abnormality in the left frontal lobe.\nDr. Alves: Treatment with dexamethasone and levetiracetam was started. The patient received one dose of each medication before she was transferred to the neurosurgical unit of this hospital for evaluation and possible brain biopsy.\nThe patient had a history of myasthenia gravis, vitamin B12 deficiency, and hypertension. Surgical history included supracervical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine fibroids (performed 31 years before the current presentation), transsternal thymectomy and wedge resection of the right upper lobe for a cortical thymoma (22 years before the current presentation), and sigmoid colectomy for recurrent diverticulitis (7 years before the current presentation). Ocular-predominant myasthenia gravis was diagnosed 18 years before the current presentation and 4 years after thymectomy. Myasthenia gravis had been treated for 11 years with cyclosporine and pyridostigmine. Seven years before the current presentation, a flare of myasthenia gravis was complicated by respiratory failure, for which the patient received bilevel positive airway pressure and underwent plasmapheresis. After that hospitalization, cyclosporine therapy was replaced by mycophenolate mofetil, which she had been taking daily for the past 7 years.\nOther medications included cholecalciferol, latanoprost ophthalmic drops, hydrochlorothiazide, polysaccharide\u2013iron complex capsules, and monthly intramuscular vitamin B12 injections. Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate had previously caused rash. The patient lived in the northeastern United States, was married, and worked in an office. She had recently traveled to California for a wedding, and she reported no exposures to animals or fresh water. She had not had any recent dental procedures. She had no history of tobacco use or injection drug use. She rarely consumed alcoholic beverages. Her mother had systemic lupus erythematosus, and her father had lung cancer. A sister had rheumatoid arthritis.\nOn examination, the oral temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 150/80 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Severe expressive aphasia was observed, and she followed commands intermittently. Orientation could not be accurately assessed. She had disconjugate gaze at rest. Motor strength was 5/5 in the left arm and left leg and 4/5 in the right arm and right leg. The blood level of glucose was normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of phosphorus was 2.2 mg per deciliter (reference range, 2.6 to 4.5). The complete blood count was normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation.\nElectroencephalography showed intermittent irregular delta slowing focally over the left frontal region but no epileptiform abnormalities. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed ill-defined parenchymal hypoattenuation involving the left superior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and left centrum semiovale with associated sulcal effacement. Treatment with dexamethasone, hydrochlorothiazide, mycophenolate mofetil, and pyridostigmine was stopped, as was treatment with cholecalciferol, latanoprost drops, polysaccharide\u2013iron complex, and vitamin B12. Treatment with levetiracetam was continued, and empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin was started.\nDr. Gavin P. Dunn: A left frontal craniotomy with open brain biopsy was planned to allow for sufficient lesional tissue to be obtained and to enable further debulking to be performed, pending intraoperative findings and the results of pathological assessment. A small craniotomy centered at the coronal suture directly over the target lesion was performed. The lesion appeared gray, and tissue that appeared abnormal was sampled in several locations of the lesion. Direct microscopic visualization of the specimens identified areas that did not appear to be completely distinct from normal tissue, and thus, further debulking was not indicated. No purulence was noted.\nDr. Christopher W. Mount: Intraoperative examination of a frozen section (Figure 2) revealed a cellular infiltrate consisting of atypical cells in a focal perivascular arrangement. No evidence of pathologically significant acute inflammation was present in the tissue. At this time, these features suggested the presence of a malignant infiltrate. Additional specimens were submitted to the pathology department for formalin fixation and interpretation.\nFIGURE 2\n\nFrozen Section of Brain Tissue.\nDr. Alves: A diagnosis of lymphoma was considered, and treatment with dexamethasone administered intravenously every 6 hours was started. On postoperative day 1, new facial droop on the right side developed, along with weakness with cervical flexion and monoplegia of the right arm.\nDr. Ford: Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 3), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed postsurgical changes in the left frontal lobe and susceptibility artifact at the biopsy site that was consistent with blood products. There was enlargement of the expansile lesion in the left frontal lobe that corresponded to an area of hyperintensity on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging.\nFIGURE 3\n\nMRI of the Head Obtained on Postoperative Day 1.\nDr. Alves: A diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. George A. Alba: A 57-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of persistent cough and pulmonary opacities.\nSix years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa after fevers, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and testicular pain had developed. He was treated with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance therapy with prednisone and weekly methotrexate. He was treated intermittently with escalating doses of prednisone because of episodic worsening of the arthralgias; the most recent such treatment was given 5 months before the current admission. At that time, owing to an exacerbation of pain associated with the arthralgias and at the direction of his physician, he increased the amount of oxycodone he had been taking. He also reported fever and weight loss. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Jeanna M. Harvey Barnes: Five months before the current admission, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Chest CT (Figure 1A and 1B) revealed mild centrilobular emphysema and small pulmonary nodules that appeared unchanged from those seen on imaging that had been performed 6 years earlier. There was also diffuse thickening of the bronchial wall, layering secretions in the trachea and right main-stem bronchus, a mildly patulous esophagus, and a small hiatal hernia. There were no clinically significant findings on imaging of the abdomen or pelvis.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies of the Chest.\nDr. Alba: A test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal, as was the IgG level.\nThree months before the current admission, the patient had fevers and a cough productive of green sputum. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air. Thrush was present in the oropharynx. Auscultation of the chest revealed crackles and wheezing in the right lung. Blood levels of electrolytes, lipase, amylase, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), First Admission (3 Mo Before Current Admission), Second Admission (1 Mo Before Current Admission), Third Admission (8 Days Before Current Admission), Current Admission\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 15.4, 14.7, 12.4, 13.6\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 44.5, 46.2, 40.9, 42.8\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 20,300, 15,480, 18,120, 21,180\n\nDifferential count (%):\nNeutrophils (%), 40\u201370, 80.9, 77.5, 90.6, 83.9\nLymphocytes (%), 22\u201344, 12.3, 17.1, 5.8, 11.6\nMonocytes (%), 4\u201311, 4.8, 4.1, 3.1, 3.7\nEosinophils (%), 0\u20138, 0.4, 0.8, 0, 0.3\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 255,000, 199,000, 480,000, 406,000\nLactate (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.2, 2.8, \u2014, 2.6, 1.8\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201313, 16, \u2014, 54, \u2014\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), <8, 126.6, \u2014, 149.7, \u2014\n1,3-\u03b2-D-glucan (pg/ml), <60, 488, \u2014, 420, >500\n\nVenous blood gases:\nFraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.4\npH, 7.30\u20137.40, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 7.36\nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 38\u201350, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 64\nPartial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 35\u201350, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 26\n\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 1C) showed patchy and confluent opacities predominantly in the right mid and lower lung.\nDr. Alba: The patient was admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin was administered. A blood test for cryptococcal antigen and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and Candida albicans; a test for Pneumocystis jirovecii was negative. During the next several days, fever resolved and the oxygen saturation and white-cell count normalized. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home to complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin. After he completed the course of levofloxacin, his cough and constitutional symptoms abated partially but did not return to baseline. His primary care physician prescribed inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol and as-needed inhaled albuterol.\nSix weeks after the patient was discharged from this hospital (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission), his wife began to have a nonproductive cough and rhinorrhea; several days later, the patient had similar symptoms, along with increased production of brown sputum. He sought medical attention after awakening with coughing and dyspnea. The temperature was 38.4\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 1D) obtained 1 month before the current admission showed patchy opacities in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes.\nDr. Alba: Electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin; oral prednisone; and inhaled albuterol and ipratropium was administered. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. After two days, the patient was discharged home to complete a 7-day course of levofloxacin.\nOver the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient had malaise, productive cough, fever, and sweats. He stopped smoking cigarettes.\nEight days before the current admission, the patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. There were crackles in both lung bases and in the right middle lung field, with no wheezes. Blood levels of electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2A) showed multifocal reticulonodular and patchy opacities, which were confluent in the right lower lobe. CT of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal clustered, centrilobular nodules and opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern with scattered areas of focal consolidation that were present predominantly in the right middle and lower lobes. There was associated mild mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy that had not been present on the previous chest CT examination.\nFIGURE 2\n\nSubsequent Imaging Studies of the Chest.\nDr. Alba: The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and additional testing was performed. Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies were negative, and blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal. A urine test for legionella antigen was negative.\nOn the third hospital day, a bronchoscopy and a transbronchial biopsy were performed. The bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from the right middle lobe was cloudy; analysis of the fluid revealed 888 nucleated cells per microliter (of which 48% were neutrophils and 2% were lymphocytes, with no eosinophils). Gram\u2019s staining of the BAL fluid revealed neutrophils and sparse growth of gram-positive cocci. Staining for acid-fast organisms was negative; culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. Tests of the BAL fluid for influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, P. jirovecii, histoplasma antigen, and blastomyces antigen were negative, as were cultures for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for M. tuberculosis was also negative. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day, with follow-up scheduled in the pulmonary clinic for 3 weeks later.\nFour days after the patient was discharged, a BAL test for galactomannan returned a positive result (antigen index, \u22653.750; negative test, <0.5), and the patient was readmitted to this hospital. He reported ongoing dyspnea, cough with thick white sputum, and persistent fever with a temperature of up to 39.3\u00b0C. A review of systems was notable for diffuse chronic arthralgias, a bitter taste in the mouth, and intermittent dysphagia. There was no chest pain, edema, orthopnea, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, or rash, and he had no known current sick contacts. The weight was 5 kg lower than that recorded 1 year earlier.\nMedical history was notable for polyarteritis nodosa, deep venous thrombosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pancreatitis in the context of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, osteopenia, and chronic neuropathic pain. Medications included aspirin, prednisone, methotrexate, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, folate supplementation, metformin, atenolol, simvastatin, pregabalin, and as-needed oxycodone, as well as inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol and albuterol as needed. Lisinopril had reportedly caused pancreatic inflammation; there were no other known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was of White European ancestry. He lived in New England with his wife and was retired from an office position. Three decades earlier, he had worked in a machine shop where solvents, fuels, and sulfur compounds were used but had had no known exposure to these agents. There was no history of exposure to mold, pets, or asbestos. He had received influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. He and his wife had traveled within the United States and to the Caribbean. He had smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit in the weeks before the current admission. He had previously smoked marijuana, rarely consumed alcohol, and never used other substances. There was no family history of autoimmune or pulmonary disease; his father had died from colorectal cancer, and his mother had had esophageal cancer and had died after a stroke. His three adult children were healthy.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/69 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. He had a slightly cushingoid appearance and was tachypneic, although he was able to speak in full sentences. Auscultation of the chest revealed rales at the right lung base, rhonchi during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases that were more pronounced in the right lung than in the left lung, and intermittent inspiratory wheezing in the right lung. The rest of the examination was normal.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2D) showed progression of the diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities, with additional patchy opacities in the right lung and left lower lobe, as compared with the image obtained 1 week earlier.\nDr. Alba: Blood levels of electrolytes, amylase, lipase, N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney and liver function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal, and a urine test for legionella antigen was negative.\nThe BAL-fluid culture obtained during the previous admission grew enterococcus species, C. albicans, and C. glabrata; no mycobacteria grew in any of three induced sputum samples obtained during the previous admission. Empirical treatment with intravenous voriconazole was initiated, and ongoing treatment with methotrexate was interrupted.\nCytologic analysis of the BAL fluid and the transbronchial-biopsy specimen obtained during the previous admission revealed evidence of acute inflammation, bronchial columnar cells, and pulmonary macrophages. There were no malignant cells. Evaluation of the bronchial mucosa revealed no abnormalities.\nOn the second hospital day, the temperature was 37.9\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: Repeat CT of the chest (Figure 2E and 2F) was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary embolism protocol. This imaging study revealed extensive centrilobular pulmonary nodules, opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern, and patchy ground-glass opacities. There was bronchial wall thickening with mucus plugging, predominantly affecting the lower lobes. There were additional areas of nodular consolidation that were more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung. These findings indicated a progression of disease as compared with the chest CT performed 1 week before the current admission. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.\nDr. Alba: Additional induced sputum samples were obtained for culture; Gram\u2019s staining revealed abundant neutrophils and abundant mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.\nOn the third hospital day, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute.\nDiagnostic tests were performed.",
