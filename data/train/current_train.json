    "user_input": "Dr. Ethan Borre (Medicine): A 36-year-old man was evaluated in the infectious diseases clinic of this hospital because of fevers. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 18 days before the current presentation\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "when he began to have a sensation of swelling in his throat. Three days later\\, the temporal temperature measured at home was 38.4\u00b0C. A home test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen was negative. The patient was evaluated in a local urgent care clinic\\, where he was told that there were white spots on his tonsils. Treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid was started for a presumptive diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. A throat culture was reportedly negative\\, but treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid was continued. During the next 4 days\\, fevers persisted. A repeat home test for SARS-CoV-2 antigen was negative. Eleven days before the current presentation\\, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. In addition to fevers\\, the patient reported headaches. Two weeks before the onset of symptoms\\, he had traveled with his wife to the southwestern United States for 1 week. During the trip\\, his wife had begun to have fever and sore throat; her symptoms had resolved after several days\\, and she did not seek medical evaluation. The patient reported that he did not have throat pain\\, but rather that the lower part of his neck felt swollen and that moving his neck caused discomfort. He had no dysphagia\\, odynophagia\\, rhinorrhea\\, or rash. His medical history included seasonal allergies. Two years earlier\\, a routine screening test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had been negative. In addition to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid\\, medications included ibuprofen as needed for headaches and acetaminophen as needed for fevers. The patient had no known drug allergies. He lived in Massachusetts and worked in an office setting. He had moved to the United States from Asia 7 years before the current presentation. He drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. He occasionally smoked tobacco. His father had hypertension\\, and his paternal grandmother had cancer of unclear primary origin. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 127/69 mm Hg\\, the pulse 90 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The tonsils appeared normal\\, without exudates or enlargement. There was mild tenderness on palpation over the anterior portion of the neck that was thought to correspond to enlarged lymph nodes in the anterior cervical region. The remainder of the examination was normal. A complete blood count with differential count and blood levels of electrolytes\\, glucose\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, alkaline phosphatase\\, and bilirubin were normal\\, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was 65.8 mg per liter (reference value\\, <8.0). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) antibodies was negative. Urinalysis was normal. A specimen of blood was obtained for culture. The results of chest radiography were normal. A diagnosis of viral pharyngitis was considered\\, but treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid for possible streptococcal pharyngitis was continued. TABLE 1  Laboratory Data. Variable\\, Reference Range\\, 11 Days before the Current Presentation  Hematocrit (%)\\, 41.0\u201353.0\\, 43.8 Hemoglobin (g/dl)\\, 13.5\u201317.5\\, 14.6 White-cell count (per \u00b5l)\\, 4500\u201311\\,000\\, 7320  Differential count (per pl): Neutrophils (per \u00b5l)\\, 1800\u20137700\\, 5100 Lymphocytes (per \u00b5l)\\, 1000\u20134800\\, 1430 Monocytes (per \u00b5l)\\, 200\u20131200\\, 610 Eosinophils (per \u00b5l)\\, 0\u2013900\\, 130 Basophils (per \u00b5l)\\, 0\u2013300\\, 30 Immature granulocytes (per \u00b5l)\\, 0\u2013100\\, 20  Platelet count (per \u00b5l)\\, 150\\,000\u2013400\\,000\\, 375\\,000  During the next 6 days\\, daily fevers and headaches continued\\, and fatigue developed. The patient reported his symptoms during a telephone call with his primary care physician. Blood cultures that had been obtained during the previous evaluation were without growth\\, and additional testing was performed. The blood level of CRP was 138.9 mg per liter\\, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 81 mm per hour (reference range\\, 0 to 14). A test for Lyme disease was nonreactive. The result of an interferon-\u03b3 release assay to detect previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis was invalid because of a test control failure. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Shambo Guha Roy: Computed tomography (CT) of the neck (Figure 1)\\, chest\\, and abdomen was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. A calcified lung nodule that was observed in the left lower lobe was consistent with previous granulomatous disease\\, and mild degenerative changes were noted in the thoracic spine. Evaluation of the thyroid gland was suboptimal owing to a streak artifact from the arms; however\\, a possible hypoattenuating nodule was observed in the right lobe. FIGURE 1  CT of the Neck. Dr. Borre: During the next 4 days\\, fevers continued\\, and the patient was referred to the infectious diseases clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. In the infectious diseases clinic\\, additional history was obtained. The patient reported that fevers were most prominent in the evening; the highest recorded temperature was 39.5\u00b0C. He had had two episodes of chills associated with fever\\, as well as occasional night sweats. He had no pets or animal exposures. He did not consume unpasteurized cheeses or uncooked meats. He was sexually active with his wife. A dental extraction had been performed 2 months before the onset of fevers. He had no known exposures to persons with tuberculosis. The temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 144/98 mm Hg\\, the pulse 130 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was noted to cough occasionally during the examination but was breathing comfortably with normal lung sounds. The oropharynx appeared normal\\, without tonsillar exudates. There was no supraclavicular\\, submandibular\\, cervical\\, axillary\\, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Firm\\, nontender thyroid tissue was palpable in the anterior portion of the neck. No rashes or skin lesions were present\\, including on the palms or soles. The heart was tachycardic with a regular rhythm and no murmurs. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. A diagnostic test was performed.,Subacute thyroiditis."

    "ground_truth_output": "progressive renal insufficiency\\, and leukopenia. Seven months before this admission\\, the patient was admitted to another hospital after routine laboratory testing had identified abnormalities\\, including a creatinine level of 3.2 mg per deciliter (283 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 0.50 to 1.40 mg per deciliter [44 to 124 mmol per liter])\\, a blood urea nitrogen level of 54 mg per deciliter (19 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 7 to 30 mg per deciliter [2.5 to 11 mmol per liter])\\, and a calcium level of 12.1 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 8.8 to 10.6 mg per deciliter [2.2 to 2.6 mmol per liter]). Twelve months earlier\\, the creatinine level had been 1.7 mg per deciliter (150 mmol per liter). On admission to the other hospital\\, he reported unintentional weight loss of 14 kg over the preceding 12 months\\, malaise\\, waking every 2 hours to empty his bladder\\, and new mild exertional dyspnea. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 92 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 117/74 mm Hg\\, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 68 kg and the body-mass index (BMI\\, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 23.5. Examination was notable for cachexia and hepatosplenomegaly (with the liver and spleen palpable 6 cm below the costal margin) without lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. Blood levels of magnesium\\, bilirubin\\, globulin\\, creatine kinase\\, uric acid\\, and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Shepard: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, reportedly revealed focal nodular soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch\\, descending thoracic aorta\\, and abdominal aorta. Splenomegaly and left paraaortic adenopathy were present. Small pulmonary nodules and patchy consolidation were observed\\, along with a small left pleural effusion. Dr. Matza: After treatment with intravenous normal saline and furosemide\\, the calcium level normalized and the creatinine level decreased to 2.3 mg per deciliter (203 mmol per liter). The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day. Dr. Rory K. Crotty: A bone marrow biopsy performed 2 weeks later at the first hospital revealed hypercellular marrow and multiple nonnecrotizing granulomas. Staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungi was negative. No cultures were obtained. Dr. Matza: The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 89 U per liter (reference range\\, 9 to 67). A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered\\, and therapy with high-dose oral prednisone was started. One month later\\, the ACE level decreased to 41 U per liter\\, and the patient\u2019s energy level and appetite improved. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone were unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea. Three months later\\, the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the first hospital for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was initiated for prophylaxis against pneumocystis while the patient continued to receive high-dose prednisone. Tests of pulmonary function showed mild obstruction\\, with a clinically significant response after the use of a bronchodilator\\, and moderate restriction\\, with moderately reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. A second attempt to taper the dose of prednisone was unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea. During the next 2 months\\, intermittent confusion\\, progressive weakness in the legs\\, right foot drop\\, and increasing unsteadiness and gait instability developed; the patient began to use a walker to ambulate. He also had at least two falls. He required help from his wife to perform activities of daily living\\, including bathing and dressing. The patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at the first hospital. Complement levels were normal\\, as was the level of rheumatoid factor. Tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA)\\, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)\\, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Weekly treatment with oral methotrexate and folic acid was started for presumed sarcoidosis. Eleven days later\\, the patient presented to a second hospital with a new facial droop on the left side\\, slurred speech\\, and confusion. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 102 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 141/86 mm Hg\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 63 kg and the BMI 21.9. The patient was oriented to person\\, place\\, and time; neurologic examination was notable for a mild facial droop on the left side\\, mildly increased muscle tone\\, right foot drop\\, and symmetric mild weakness in the arms and upper legs. Cachexia\\, tachycardia\\, and splenomegaly were noted. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a 12-mm right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm\\, a right cerebellar cavernous malformation\\, and numerous punctate foci (in the pons\\, left cerebellum\\, right occipital lobe\\, and left thalamus) characterized by hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging and restricted diffusion. Dr. Matza: Clopidogrel and levetiracetam were initiated. Echocardiography did not show intracardiac thrombus or shunting; carotid ultrasonography did not show stenosis. Electromyography revealed evidence of mild L5\u2013S1 radiculopathy and right ulnar and median neuropathy\\, but there was no evidence of myopathy or upper motor neuron disease. Owing to progressive leukopenia (white-cell count\\, 1390 per microliter) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count\\, 51\\,000 per microliter)\\, methotrexate\\, clopidogrel\\, levetiracetam\\, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole were discontinued; cyanocobalamin was started. On the fourth hospital day\\, a fever with a temperature of 38.3\u00b0C developed; specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture\\, and intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were initiated. The C-reactive protein level was 101.8 mg per liter. Blood tests for ANA\\, ANCA\\, rheumatoid factor\\, influenza type A and B antigens\\, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen\\, antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2\\, hepatitis B virus surface antigen\\, hepatitis B virus core antibodies\\, cytomegalovirus DNA\\, Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA\\, and parvovirus IgM were negative\\, as were urine tests for legionella antigen and histoplasma antigen. A rapid plasma reagin test was negative\\, and an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was reported as indeterminate. Dr. Shepard: CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed scattered ground-glass opacities in the lungs\\, nodular and consolidative opacities in the lungs\\, mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes\\, small pleural effusions\\, and splenomegaly (with the spleen measuring 16 cm in the cephalocaudad dimension; normal length\\, <13 cm). Focal soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta and prominence of the soft tissue surrounding the infrarenal abdominal aorta were also noted. The next day\\, magnetic resonance angiography was performed. A T2-weighted fat-saturated image (Figure 1A) showed signal hyperintensity in the soft tissue around the infrarenal aorta and in the adjacent left paraaortic lymph nodes that was indicative of adenopathy\\, with a focal abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm seen on time-of-flight imaging (Figure 1B). FIGURE 1  Initial Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Chest. Dr. Matza: On the eighth hospital day\\, a bone marrow biopsy was performed. On the ninth day\\, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On the patient\u2019s arrival\\, a review of systems was limited owing to delirium\\, and history was obtained in part from the patient\u2019s family. The review was notable for months of fatigue\\, malaise\\, leg weakness\\, right foot drop\\, waxing and waning confusion\\, exertional dyspnea\\, and an inability to walk and perform activities of daily living. Palpitations\\, dry cough\\, easy bruising\\, and irritable bladder were present\\, but he had no chills\\, anorexia\\, joint pain\\, erythema\\, rashes\\, nodules\\, myalgia\\, chest pain\\, dizziness\\, productive cough\\, hemoptysis\\, orthopnea\\, wheezing\\, gastrointestinal symptoms\\, dysuria\\, hematuria\\, ocular or nasal symptoms\\, skin or nail changes\\, or headache. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for hypothyroidism\\, hypertension\\, hypercholesterolemia\\, progressive kidney disease\\, degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine\\, scoliosis\\, tubular adenoma\\, and leukopenia. Eight years before this admission\\, a mass in the bladder that measured 4.5 cm by 4.0 cm was noted on ultrasonography\\, which had been performed for evaluation of hematuria. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed at another hospital\\, but the resection was reportedly incomplete. Histologic examination revealed non\u2013muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma. Repeat cystoscopy and transurethral resection\\, performed 3\\, 8\\, and 16 months after the initial procedures\\, each revealed fragments of non\u2013muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma\\, and intravesical bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) was administered. Cystoscopy\\, performed 1 year before this admission for the management of bladder stones\\, identified a recurrent polypoid bladder tumor\\, which was treated with transurethral resection. Outpatient medications included prednisone\\, methotrexate\\, folic acid\\, aspirin\\, levothyroxine\\, simvastatin\\, tamsulosin\\, cholecalciferol\\, sodium bicarbonate\\, calcium carbonate\\, omeprazole\\, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole\\, fluticasone\u2013salmeterol\\, and as-needed inhaled albuterol. Penicillin had caused an unknown reaction. The patient was a retired pharmacist and lived with his wife. He had a remote history of smoking a half pack of cigarettes daily for 2 years and drank alcohol infrequently. He had not traveled recently and had had no environmental\\, animal\\, or toxic exposures. There was no family history of autoimmune\\, neurologic\\, infectious\\, or pulmonary disorders. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 100 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 122/76 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 54 kg and the BMI 18.8. He was anxious\\, cachectic\\, and appeared chronically ill. He correctly reported his name\\, location\\, and the time and date; however\\, he was unable to follow simple two-step commands. The cranial-nerve examination revealed a subtle facial droop on the left side. There were tremors in the arms and legs at rest and with motion\\, as well as right foot drop and diffusely increased tone. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing showed dysmetria. Bibasilar crackles (greater in the left lung than in the right) were heard on lung auscultation. Hepatosplenomegaly was present. There were diffuse ecchymoses on the trunk\\, arms\\, and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. The international normalized ratio and blood levels of ammonia\\, bilirubin\\, creatine kinase\\, folic acid\\, globulin\\, haptoglobin\\, lactate dehydrogenase\\, lactic acid\\, and magnesium were normal. The ACE level was 36 U per liter (reference range\\, 8 to 53). Serum protein electrophoresis showed no bands\\, but a mild\\, diffuse decrease in globulin was noted. The urine free kappa light-chain level was 134.2 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 0.4 to 15.1)\\, and the urine free lambda light-chain level was 35.6 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 0.8 to 10.1)\\, with a normal ratio (3.77; reference range\\, 0.50 to 4.00). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of blood\\, urine\\, and sputum were obtained. During the first 3 days of this admission\\, the patient became lethargic; when he was awakened\\, his speech was incoherent and dysarthric. Dr. Schaefer: On the third hospital day\\, MRI of the head (Figure 2) with magnetic resonance angiography revealed a stable right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm\\, as well as a stable right cerebellar cavernous malformation. There were punctate and patchy foci characterized by hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging and restricted diffusion in the midbrain\\, pons\\, medulla\\, left cerebellum\\, right occipital lobe\\, and left thalamus; the foci had increased in size and extent from the previous study. FIGURE 2  MRI of the Head. Dr. Shepard: Positron-emission tomography (PET)\u2013CT (Figure 1D through 1F) revealed multiple foci of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in periaortic soft tissue and paraaortic lymph nodes\\, in the axial skeleton (cervical vertebral body\\, ribs\\, manubrium\\, and sacrum)\\, and in the left testis. Dr. Matza: Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein\\, 1\\,3-\u03b2-d-glucan\\, coxiella antibodies\\, cytomegalovirus IgM and IgG\\, cryptococcal antigen\\, human chorionic gonadotropin\\, and Treponema pallidum antibodies were negative\\, as was a urine test for histoplasma antigen. Electroencephalographic monitoring showed frequent sharp\\, irregular delta and theta discharges; treatment with levetiracetam was started. On the fourth hospital day\\, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C. Ultrasound images showed testes of normal size and echotexture without focal lesions\\, but the epididymides were enlarged and heterogeneous. The kidneys were normal in size\\, with diffusely echogenic parenchyma\\, and a 19-mm bladder stone was present. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function\\, no evidence of clinically significant valvular disease\\, and a mildly dilated aorta. Flow cytometry showed a markedly reduced CD4+ T-cell count (11 per microliter; reference range\\, 348 to 1456). Antibody tests for bartonella and brucella were negative. Somnolence progressed\\, and on the fifth hospital day\\, the right pupil was noted to be slightly larger than the left and the patient had increased tremor. Fosphenytoin therapy was initiated\\, and he was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit. The oxygen saturation declined to 90% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute\\, and a Cheyne\u2013Stokes pattern of respiration was observed. The trachea was intubated\\, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. A diagnosis was made.,Disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection."

The patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission\\, when projectile vomiting began to occur once every few days\\, typically after eating solid foods. The vomiting did not seem to bother the patient\\, and he immediately returned to his normal activity after each episode. During the subsequent 12 days\\, the vomiting became more frequent\\, occurring daily\\, and had begun to occur after drinking liquids as well. Two days before this admission\\, the patient was evaluated in the pediatric primary care clinic of this hospital. On examination\\, the weight was 7.36 kg (0.4th percentile for his age) (Figure 1). The patient appeared alert\\, attentive\\, and comfortable but thin. The abdomen was soft\\, without distention or tenderness\\, and there was no evidence of organomegaly or masses on palpation. The skin was diffusely dry with excoriations. Treatment with omeprazole was started. FIGURE 1  Growth Curves. Over the course of the next 2 days\\, the patient lost interest in eating solid food and preferred milk and water. He gagged at the sight of food. The frequency of the vomiting had increased\\, occurring after the patient ate or drank anything. On the day of this admission\\, the patient refused to take any food by mouth. His parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival\\, his parents reported that in the previous 2 weeks\\, he had had normal activity\\, wet diapers\\, and daily soft stools. They also noted that he always seemed thirsty\\, and when given liquid\\, he would drink a lot. At times\\, he would even suck the water out of the washcloths that were used to bathe him. The patient had been born after induction of labor at 38 weeks\u2019 gestation owing to maternal gestational hypertension. He had received routine newborn care and met normal developmental milestones. He maintained normal growth for his age until an evaluation at 9 months of age\\, when the weight was 7.44 kg (1.6th percentile)\\, and the body length was 68.2 cm (6.5th percentile) (Figure 1). At a routine evaluation when he was 6 months of age\\, the weight was 7.39 kg (27.1st percentile)\\, and the length was 66.7 cm (43.1st percentile). The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and eczema. Medications included omeprazole; he was not receiving any vitamins or supplements. He had no known drug allergies\\, and immunizations were up to date. The patient lived with his mother and father in a suburban area of New England. His father had GERD and melanoma\\, and cardiomyopathy had led to heart transplantation 9 years earlier. His mother was well. The patient\u2019s paternal grandmother had the Lynch syndrome and hyperparathyroidism. His maternal grandmother had diabetes and coronary artery disease\\, his maternal grandfather had hypertension and eczema\\, and his maternal uncle had the DiGeorge syndrome. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 102/78 mm Hg\\, the pulse 140 beats per minute\\, and the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute. The patient was alert and appropriately interactive. He appeared thin. The abdomen was soft\\, and there was no distension or tenderness. The muscle tone was normal. The blood calcium level was 13.2 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiographs of the wrists and knees were normal. The dose of omeprazole was increased.

    "ground_truth_output": "when she stood up to speak during a meeting for her condominium association. Bilateral\\, frontal\\, pulsatile headache developed suddenly and reached maximal intensity within seconds. The patient rated the pain at 10 (on a scale of 0 to 10\\, with 10 indicating the most severe pain) and noted that it was the worst headache pain that she had ever had. The pain was so severe that she could not complete her sentence. She sat down\\, feeling as though she might faint because of the severity of the pain. She repeatedly told her husband\\, \u201cSomething is really wrong.\u201d Nausea developed without emesis. When the symptoms did not abate after 30 minutes\\, emergency medical services were called\\, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On arrival at the emergency department\\, the patient reported ongoing headache and nausea. Medical history included hypertension and cervical disk disease with chronic neck pain. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide and oral conjugated estrogens\\, which the patient took every 3 days for symptoms of menopause. She had no known allergies. She was a lifelong nonsmoker\\, drank alcohol occasionally\\, and did not use illicit drugs. She lived with her husband and worked as an administrative assistant. Her mother had diabetes. There was no family history of venous thromboembolism. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 157/77 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 77 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The neck was supple. She was oriented to time\\, place\\, and person. Her speech was fluent with intact naming\\, repetition\\, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. The visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The visualized portions of the retina were normal in both eyes with normal-appearing optic disks. Tests of motor strength and sensation showed normal results\\, as did tests of reflexes and cerebellar function. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal\\, as were the complete blood count with differential count and the results of tests of kidney function and coagulation. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Javier M. Romero: Two hours after the onset of headache\\, computed tomography (CT) of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1)\\, revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left superior parietal lobule and paramedian parietal sulci.

    "ground_truth_output": "Critical Care\\, and Pain Medicine): A 59-year-old woman had hypotension and electrocardiographic (ECG) ST-segment abnormalities after the administration of anesthetic agents while she was in the operating room of this hospital. Eighteen weeks before the current presentation\\, features of acromegaly were observed on routine physical examination by the patient\u2019s primary care provider at another hospital. The blood level of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) was 595 ng per milliliter (reference range\\, 50 to 317) and the growth hormone level 9.1 ng per milliliter (reference range\\, 0.0 to 7.1). The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Eleven weeks before the current presentation\\, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic. She reported that her shoe size\\, which had been stable since young adulthood\\, had recently increased by two sizes. She also reported a deepening of her voice\\, fatigue\\, headaches\\, arthralgias\\, oily skin\\, skin tags\\, and acne on her face and back. She had had an intentional weight loss of 12.7 kg during the previous 9 months. The facial features were coarse\\, and there was no frontal bossing. Visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The tongue was thick and obscured the soft palate; the lower jaw was enlarged\\, with increased spacing between the teeth. The hands and feet were large and fleshy. Scattered skin tags were present on the neck. Auscultation of the heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a normal-sized pituitary gland with a well-circumscribed area of hypoenhancement that measured 9 mm by 7 mm by 10 mm. The patient was referred to the neurosurgery clinic of this hospital\\, and an elective microscopic transsphenoidal hypophysectomy was subsequently recommended. Seven weeks before the current presentation\\, an extensive preoperative evaluation was performed\\, given the patient\u2019s diagnosis of acromegaly. As part of the preoperative evaluation\\, additional history was obtained. The patient\u2019s medical history included hypertension\\, prediabetes\\, obesity\\, obstructive sleep apnea\\, polycystic ovary syndrome\\, rheumatoid arthritis\\, osteoarthritis\\, and scoliosis. Physical activity was limited by pain in the knees; she could climb a flight of stairs but did so very slowly because of knee pain. She had no chest pain or dyspnea. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide\\, olmesartan\\, and ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed for joint pain. Hydroxychloroquine had caused leukopenia\\, and meperidine had caused gastrointestinal upset. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her husband and worked in an office. She did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; she drank alcohol rarely. Multiple maternal and paternal family members had cardiovascular disease. ECG revealed sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities\\, including a T-wave inversion in lead III. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular volume and systolic function\\, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%\\, and there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal; the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 28 mm Hg. Mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation were present. A pharmacologic stress test\\, with myocardial perfusion imaging performed after the administration of regadenoson\\, revealed no evidence of ischemia. Three weeks before the current presentation\\, the patient was taken to the operating room for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. The preoperative temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 72 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 131/69 mm Hg\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 35.7. Midazolam was administered\\, and anesthesia was induced with fentanyl\\, propofol\\, lidocaine\\, and rocuronium. Tracheal intubation was moderately challenging because of the presence of redundant tissue in the supraglottic region. During intubation\\, the oxygen saturation decreased to 79% but normalized in less than 1 minute. Inhaled sevoflurane (an anesthetic) and dexamethasone and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam were administered\\, remifentanil and phenylephrine infusions were started\\, and the patient was placed in a level\\, supine position for the procedure. After the induction of anesthesia\\, before the surgical procedure was initiated\\, the blood pressure gradually decreased (Figure 1A). Sixteen minutes after induction began\\, the blood pressure was 96/48 mm Hg and the heart rate 75 beats per minute; 29 minutes after induction began\\, the blood pressure had decreased to 67/36 mm Hg and the heart rate to 71 beats per minute. Telemetric monitoring (Figure 2A) showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads and ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads. Aspirin was administered rectally\\, the rate of the phenylephrine infusion was increased\\, and multiple boluses of phenylephrine and an ephedrine bolus were administered. The blood pressure increased to 110/54 mm Hg and the heart rate to 111 beats per minute. Telemetric monitoring showed resolution of the ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Findings on ECG and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) performed in the operating room were consistent with those of the preoperative ECG and TTE. The procedure was aborted\\, the patient was weaned from the vasopressor therapies\\, and the trachea was extubated. She was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit. FIGURE 1  Intraoperative Vital Signs. FIGURE 2  Intraoperative Telemetric Monitoring. On admission to the cardiac intensive care unit\\, the blood level of troponin T was 10 ng per liter (reference range\\, 0 to 9); 1 hour later\\, the level had decreased to 8 ng per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography was normal. Computed tomographic angiography of the coronary arteries revealed moderate stenosis of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery. The intraoperative ST-segment elevations were attributed to coronary vasospasm. Treatment with amlodipine and isosorbide mononitrate was initiated for coronary vasospasm\\, and treatment with atorvastatin was started for nonobstructive coronary artery disease. After discussion among the cardiology\\, neurosurgery\\, and anesthesia teams\\, it was determined that the patient remained a candidate for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy\\, particularly because the surgery could offer a cure for her acromegaly; the procedure was rescheduled. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day. TABLE 1  Laboratory Data.

The preoperative blood pressure\\, as measured through an arterial catheter\\, was 118/67 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. Sedation with fentanyl and midazolam was started\\, topical lidocaine was used to anesthetize the airways\\, and fiberoptic tracheal intubation was performed while the patient was awake. Anesthesia was then induced with propofol\\, rocuronium\\, and sevoflurane. A phenylephrine infusion was started\\, and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered. The blood pressure decreased abruptly to 54/29 mm Hg (Figure 1B). Telemetric monitoring (Figure 2B) showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads and ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads.

    "ground_truth_output": "when abdominal pain\\, diarrhea\\, and ascites developed. A pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with metastases to the liver and spleen was ultimately diagnosed\\, and treatment with octreotide and everolimus was initiated. Three years before this presentation\\, treatment with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy was initiated; four cycles were completed over the course of the next 2 years. Eight months before this presentation\\, the patient decided to stop taking everolimus because of fatigue. Seven months before this presentation\\, the patient was evaluated at another hospital because of weight gain\\, hyperglycemia\\, and changes in mood. She was found to have elevated blood levels of corticotropin and elevated salivary and urinary levels of cortisol. Dr. Adina Haramati: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a pituitary lesion measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. A specimen of blood obtained from the inferior petrosal sinus identified a pituitary source of corticotropin secretion. Dr. Pak: Treatment with octreotide was discontinued\\, and 3 months before this presentation\\, transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary lesion was performed. After the surgery\\, the cortisol and corticotropin levels remained elevated. Repeat MRI of the head revealed a residual pituitary lesion. Transsphenoidal resection of the residual lesion was performed 2 months before this presentation. After the second surgery\\, the cortisol and corticotropin levels decreased but did not normalize. Pathological evaluation of a resected pituitary specimen revealed normal anterior pituitary architecture that was not consistent with a corticotroph adenoma. At a follow-up appointment in the endocrinology clinic after the patient was discharged\\, the 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was again elevated\\, and treatment with pasireotide was initiated. Ten days before this presentation\\, the patient began to have confusion\\, urinary incontinence\\, and recurrent falls. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. Her husband noted atypical impulsive behaviors\\, such as online shopping and excessive eating. Dr. Haramati: MRI of the head revealed a small focus of decreased enhancement within the left inferior aspect of the sella turcica\\, a finding that was consistent with postsurgical changes or residual adenoma. Dr. Pak: A morning blood level of cortisol was 80 \u03bcg per deciliter (2207 nmol per liter; reference range\\, 4 to 23 \u03bcg per deciliter [110 to 635 nmol per liter])\\, and the blood level of corticotropin was 519 pg per milliliter (114 pmol per liter; reference range\\, 7.2 to 63 pg per milliliter [1.6 to 14 pmol per liter]). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 9450 \u03bcg (26\\,069 nmol per liter; reference range\\, 3.5 to 45 \u03bcg [10 to 124 nmol per liter]). Dr. Haramati: MRI of the abdomen revealed an exophytic mass on the pancreatic tail that broadly abutted the left adrenal gland\\, thickening of both adrenal glands\\, retroperitoneal metastases on the left side\\, and extensive hepatic metastases with chronic cavernous transformation of the portal vein. Dr. Pak: Treatment with pasireotide was discontinued\\, and treatment with ketoconazole was initiated\\, in addition to potassium supplementation and spironolactone for hypokalemia. On the tenth day at the other hospital\\, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. On evaluation at this hospital\\, the patient reported fatigue but no fever\\, chills\\, night sweats\\, or weight loss. She had no cough\\, hemoptysis\\, or chest pain; no rheumatologic symptoms; and no history of dysphagia or gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her medical history included asthma and portal-vein thrombosis complicated by ascites\\, as well as hypothyroidism and central diabetes insipidus after she had undergone transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary lesions. Medications included atovaquone\\, cholecalciferol\\, desmopressin\\, ketoconazole\\, levothyroxine\\, metformin\\, pantoprazole\\, spironolactone\\, and potassium chloride. She had no known drug allergies. She did not drink alcohol or use tobacco or vaping products; she smoked marijuana occasionally. She lived with her husband in Vermont and had previously worked in a health care facility. The patient reported that she had had several skin tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis owing to her work in the health care setting\\, and none had been positive. Before her illness\\, she had frequently gardened and hiked locally. She had traveled to Canada but otherwise had not traveled outside New England. A paternal aunt had had ovarian cancer. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 152/87 mm Hg\\, the pulse 77 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.0. The patient was alert and oriented and answered questions appropriately. Her face was rounded\\, and acne and hair thinning were present. The abdomen had increased adiposity and palpable striae. There were several bruises on her arms and legs. A chest radiograph obtained on admission to this hospital showed an implanted venous access device and a patchy opacity in the right upper lung zone. Treatment with octreotide was reinitiated\\, and treatment with the other medications that the patient had been receiving was continued. The hypercortisolism was thought to be due to secretion of corticotropin from the metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Bilateral adrenalectomy was planned\\, but on the second hospital day\\, the patient became withdrawn and would not speak\\, take any oral medications\\, or consume any food. She was transferred to the intensive care unit\\, and an etomidate infusion was initiated; the dose was adjusted to attain a blood level of cortisol between 10 and 20 \u03bcg per deciliter. Subsequent treatment with intravenous lorazepam resulted in marked improvement in the patient\u2019s mental status such that she was following commands and responding appropriately to questions. On the sixth hospital day\\, bilateral adrenalectomy was performed. Treatment with intravenous hydrocortisone was initiated postoperatively\\, and on the seventh hospital day\\, the patient was transferred to the medicine unit of this hospital for further care. Dr. Haramati: On the eighth hospital day\\, sinus tachycardia developed. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material according to a pulmonary embolism protocol (Figure 1)\\, revealed a patchy consolidation in the right upper lobe with areas of cavitation and adjacent tree-in-bud opacities\\, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Although previous imaging was not available for review\\, clinical notes indicated that positron-emission tomography\u2013CT performed at another hospital 8 months before this presentation had revealed a new cavitary nodule in the right upper lobe that measured 7 mm in diameter. FIGURE 1  CT of the Chest. Dr. Pak: A sputum culture showed few squamous epithelial cells\\, rare polymorphonuclear leukocytes\\, and few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with no specific type predominating; no acid-fast bacilli were observed on a mycobacterial smear of an induced sputum sample. Urine tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens were negative\\, as was a blood test for cryptococcal antigen.

    "user_input": "Dr. Rebecca Leval (Psychiatry): A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the psychiatry clinic of this hospital 4 weeks after the birth of her first child because of anxiety and intrusive thoughts. The patient (gravida 1\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "para 1) had had gestational hypertension\\, for which she had not received medication; otherwise\\, her pregnancy had been uncomplicated. Four weeks before the current evaluation\\, she went into labor at 39 weeks 1 day\u2019s gestation and gave birth to a healthy male infant by spontaneous vaginal delivery in the labor and delivery unit of this hospital. Skin-to-skin contact\\, in which the infant is placed on the bare chest of the mother\\, was started immediately after the baby was born. During the next 2 days\\, the patient was engaged and inquisitive during postpartum counseling and education. She was able to initiate breast-feeding and appeared to be bonding appropriately with the infant. On the fourth hospital day\\, she was discharged home. At home\\, the patient breast-fed the infant but noticed that he had a poor latch. One day after discharge\\, the patient called the obstetrics clinic of this hospital to request lactation advice. She also described having difficulty sleeping and feeling anxious and nervous since giving birth. The patient was advised to start pumping breast milk in addition to breast-feeding. Treatment with sertraline was initiated. Three weeks before the current evaluation\\, the patient called the obstetrics clinic again for advice regarding the use of the breast pump. She was also concerned that the difficulties with breast-feeding were interfering with bonding with the infant\\, and she noted that her blood pressure\\, which she had measured with an ambulatory monitor at home\\, was 164/101 mm Hg. The patient was advised to seek evaluation in the labor and delivery unit of this hospital. On evaluation\\, the patient described insomnia\\, anxiety\\, painful nipples\\, decreased appetite\\, and mild headache. She reported no blurred vision or abdominal pain. The blood pressure was 140/84 mm Hg and the pulse 107 beats per minute. The patient appeared worried and anxious. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes were normal\\, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of kidney and liver function. The urinalysis was normal. Treatment with nifedipine was initiated for hypertension\\, along with lorazepam as needed for anxiety. Sertraline therapy was continued. The patient was discharged home. The next day\\, the patient awoke and told her husband\\, \u201cI can\u2019t go on like this. I can\u2019t do this anymore. I can\u2019t wake up feeling like this again.\u201d He called the obstetrics clinic and was instructed to bring her to the labor and delivery unit. On evaluation\\, the patient stated that she had stopped breast-feeding because of bleeding of the nipples and had started feeding with formula. She felt exhausted and \u201cemotionally numb\\,\u201d and she sometimes could not remember whether she had fed the baby. She described feeling lonely\\, isolated\\, distressed\\, and unable to engage in most child care duties. The patient\u2019s mother had been visiting her and her husband to assist them with child care. The patient reported that\\, during the pregnancy\\, she had been excited and had felt \u201cready and prepared\\,\u201d although somewhat nervous in anticipation of the delivery. She had not felt traumatized after the pregnancy or delivery\\, but when she had returned home\\, she felt \u201chit by a ton of trains.\u201d She would awaken frequently during the night when the infant made noises. When the infant was quiet\\, the patient was unable to sleep because of racing thoughts and feeling overwhelmed. She said\\, \u201cThe idea of being this baby\u2019s mother for the rest of my life is too much for me to handle. I don\u2019t want to do this now or for the rest of my life.\u201d She added\\, \u201cI wish I were dead sometimes\u201d but reported no active suicidal or homicidal ideation or plan. The patient had a history of intermittent insomnia and migraines. She had had dysthymic symptoms as a teenager when she had moved to the United States from Central America\\, and she had had mild generalized anxiety and anxiety with public speaking during college\\, for which she had taken propranolol. She had had no previous suicidal or homicidal ideation or history of self-harm behaviors\\, and she had never had a psychiatric admission or intensive psychiatric treatment. The patient took prenatal vitamins\\, nifedipine\\, and sertraline. She also took lorazepam as needed for anxiety\\, acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for headaches\\, and docusate for constipation. There were no known drug allergies. She was on maternity leave from her work as an administrator\\, and she lived in suburban New England with her infant and husband. She felt safe and supported in the home. The patient drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Her mother had migraines\\, her father hypertension and anxiety\\, her brother anxiety\\, her maternal grandmother hematologic cancer\\, and her paternal grandmother hypertension. Her maternal grandfather had died of lung cancer and her paternal grandfather of a stroke. On the day of the current evaluation\\, the patient presented to this hospital to establish care with a psychiatrist. On evaluation\\, the patient repeatedly said\\, \u201cThe baby is a good baby\u201d and stated that she did not want to hurt the infant or other people; however\\, she described intrusive thoughts of stabbing the infant and had visual hallucinations of herself holding a knife. She noted that the thoughts had started after delivery and had become increasingly vivid and frequent. They caused distress and anxiety and led to episodes of intense crying\\, rapid breathing\\, and feeling shaky. She avoided the kitchen because knives were present\\, and she had stopped cooking \u2014 an activity that she had previously enjoyed. The patient did not feel comfortable holding or feeding the infant because of the unwanted\\, intrusive thoughts and thus avoided physical contact with him. However\\, she checked on him every few minutes to make sure that he was alive and breathing and frequently asked her husband whether the infant was OK. The patient repeatedly searched on the internet looking for reassurance that she would not act on these thoughts. She contacted other mothers online and talked to her husband and mother to seek reassurance that she was not \u201ca bad mother.\u201d However\\, she had not told them or her clinicians about the intrusive thoughts because she was terrified that the infant would be taken away from her. On examination\\, the blood pressure was 138/83 mm Hg and the pulse 68 beats per minute. The patient was tearful and appeared exhausted. Her mood was anxious and dysphoric\\, and her affect was restricted and congruent with her mood. She did not have disorganized thinking\\, delusional content\\, or perceptual disturbances. A diagnosis was made.,Postpartum obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder."

Packed red cells were transfused\\, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Treatment with glucocorticoids was initiated for a working diagnosis of Coombs\u2019-negative autoimmune hemolytic anemia. On the third hospital day\\, anemia persisted\\, and additional units of packed red cells were transfused. The blood pressure had increased from 118/62 mm Hg on admission to 150/60 mm Hg. Treatment with glucocorticoids was stopped\\, and treatment with captopril was initiated for a working diagnosis of scleroderma renal crisis. Blood testing for the level of ADAMTS13 activity was performed\\, and on the sixth hospital day\\, treatment with plasmapheresis was started for the possible diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient underwent a total of six sessions of plasmapheresis during the first 2 weeks of the hospitalization. During the second week of the hospitalization\\, treatment with eculizumab was initiated. The patient received packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days for ongoing hemolytic anemia. The results of the blood test for activity of ADAMTS13 returned; the activity level was 65% (reference value\\, >67%)\\, and treatment with plasmapheresis was stopped. During the third week of the hospitalization\\, treatment with eculizumab was continued\\, and treatment with rituximab was initiated; however\\, the patient still received packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days. During the fourth week of the hospitalization\\, weekly treatment with both eculizumab and rituximab was continued\\, and a 3-day course of intravenous immune globulin was administered. Despite this treatment\\, there was no reduction in hemolysis. During the fifth week of the hospitalization\\, the patient continued to receive packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days\\, and thrombocytopenia developed. Treatment with glucocorticoids was resumed\\, and treatment with twice-weekly injections of epoetin alfa was initiated. A biopsy specimen of the bone marrow reportedly showed hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and erythroid predominance. During the sixth week of the hospitalization\\, the need for red-cell transfusion persisted\\, treatment with cyclophosphamide was initiated\\, and the dose of captopril was increased. During the seventh week of the hospitalization\\, acute kidney injury (AKI) developed\\, and treatment with captopril and glucocorticoids was stopped. On the 50th hospital day\\, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. On evaluation at this hospital\\, the patient reported nausea\\, poor appetite\\, and weight loss of 9 kg during the past 2 months. She also reported that her urine had appeared pink or cola-colored after each transfusion of packed red cells. Twenty-one years earlier\\, localized clinical stage T1cpN1aM0 (according to the tumor\u2013node\u2013metastasis classification system)\\, estrogen receptor (ER)\u2013positive\\, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\u2013negative invasive lobular breast cancer of the left breast was diagnosed. She had been treated initially with lumpectomy\\, radiation\\, and adjuvant chemotherapy\\, as well as with tamoxifen for 5 years and letrozole for 2 years. Three years before the current admission\\, there was a locoregional recurrence of ER-positive breast cancer in her left axilla; a lymph-node biopsy was negative. Staging studies reportedly revealed mildly prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and several indeterminate hepatic and renal lesions. Biopsy of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes was reportedly negative. The patient declined recommended chemotherapeutic treatment options for recurrent breast cancer and instead opted for surveillance imaging. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging\\, ultrasonography\\, and mammography of the breasts\\, which had been performed 6 months before the current admission\\, were reportedly unchanged from previous imaging. She had not palpated any new breast lumps on self-examination. Three years before the current admission\\, systemic sclerosis associated with antibodies against RNA polymerase III was diagnosed. Sclerosis was limited to the skin\\, and the patient had not received any specific treatment. Other medical history included Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome\\, gastroesophageal reflux disease\\, latent tuberculosis that had been diagnosed 30 years earlier and treated with isoniazid for 9 months\\, dyslipidemia\\, and osteoporosis. Medications included exemestane\\, goserelin\\, calcium\\, cholecalciferol\\, pantoprazole\\, and rosuvastatin. The patient took no over-the-counter remedies or supplements. She was allergic to trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole\\, which had caused fever and hives. She drank alcohol rarely and did not use any other substances. She had smoked tobacco for 3 years but had quit 50 years before the current admission. The patient was married and lived with her husband in New England. She was retired from work in health care. Three of her sisters had had breast cancer in their seventh decades of life; there was no family history of hemolysis. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 162/98 mm Hg\\, the pulse 105 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 17. The patient was alert and oriented. There was jaundice and scleral icterus. She had a well-healed lumpectomy scar on the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There was no cervical\\, supraclavicular\\, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Mild skin thickening was present on the hands and feet\\, with subtly reduced skin mobility of the forearms and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of creatinine was 2.87 mg per deciliter (254 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range\\, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter])\\, and the blood urea nitrogen level was 62 mg per deciliter (22 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [3 to 9 mmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 3+ blood and 2+ protein\\, without bilirubin\\, urobilinogen\\, glucose\\, ketones\\, leukocyte esterase\\, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed 10 to 20 red cells per high-power field (reference range\\, 0 to 2) and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field (reference value\\, <10)\\, and there were muddy-brown casts without dysmorphic red cells. The total protein:creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample was 6.41 (reference value\\, <0.15). A peripheral-blood smear was obtained. Dr. Robert Ta: The peripheral-blood smear (Figure 1) showed anisopoikilocytosis\\, 10 to 15 schistocytes per high-power field\\, teardrop cells\\, nucleated red cells\\, reticulocytes\\, and mature and left-shifted myeloid cells.

His daughter\\, a health care worker\\, called emergency medical services when she noticed that he had facial redness and flushing and learned of the swelling of his neck and arms. On evaluation at the other hospital\\, the temperature was 35.6\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 78 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 121/57 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The face was flushed\\, and the neck was swollen. Breath sounds were absent in the right lung fields. The blood levels of troponin I and amylase were normal\\, as were the results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1  Laboratory Data.

There was evidence of mass effect on the right main pulmonary artery and right main-stem and right upper-lobe bronchi\\, encasement of the right bronchus intermedius\\, occlusion of the superior vena cava (SVC) and narrowing of the right superior pulmonary vein\\, pulmonary emboli in the pulmonary artery of the left lower lobe\\, consolidation and atelectasis in the right upper lobe\\, chest-wall edema and extensive venous collateral vessels\\, and bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions. The patient was admitted to the other hospital\\, and intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam and heparin were administered. The next day\\, thoracentesis was performed\\, and 500 ml of cloudy yellow fluid was removed. On analysis of the pleural fluid\\, the fluid glucose level was 98 mg per deciliter (5.4 mmol per liter)\\, the protein level 3.4 g per deciliter\\, the lactate dehydrogenase level 74 U per liter\\, and the pH 7.5. Gram\u2019s staining of the pleural fluid revealed no organisms\\, and no malignant cells were identified on cytologic analysis. Ultrasonography of the legs showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis. CT of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, reportedly showed no hemorrhage or stroke\\, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis reportedly revealed subcentimeter lucent areas in the iliac bones. The next day\\, the patient was transferred to the oncology unit of this hospital for further evaluation and care. On admission to this hospital\\, the patient reported that\\, during the past 3 days\\, he had had progressive swelling of both upper arms\\, as well as pain in the right shoulder and arm. He noted weight loss of approximately 10 kg in the past 6 months\\, anorexia\\, hoarse voice\\, dizziness with changes in position (including bending forward)\\, and dyspnea on exertion. A review of systems was negative for hemoptysis\\, chest pain\\, palpitations\\, nausea\\, changes in bowel habits\\, vomiting\\, abdominal pain\\, night sweats\\, headache\\, and diplopia. Medical history included surgery on the shoulder and leg. The patient took no medications\\, and there were no known adverse reactions to medications. He was self-employed and had worked in plumbing and engineering. He had smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 40 years and smoked marijuana occasionally. He drank five beers per day two times per week. His family history was notable for pancreatic cancer in his mother. The temperature was 37.1\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 110 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 114/66 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 90 kg\\, the height 172 cm\\, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 30.6. There was neck swelling and erythema\\, with no stridor. Jugular venous distention was present. On auscultation\\, the heart sounds were tachycardic but distant\\, and the lung sounds were markedly decreased on the right side. There was edema of the arms\\, with more pronounced swelling in the right arm than in the left arm\\, as well as erythema on the chest and evidence of engorged veins in the chest wall. The blood level of glucose was normal\\, as were the results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia with premature atrial beats\\, borderline-low precordial lead voltage\\, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. Dr. Subba R. Digumarthy: Chest CT\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a persistent large central mass in the right upper lobe with occlusion of the right upper-lobe bronchus and collapse of the right upper lobe. There were multiple enlarged right mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes (Figure 1A). The brachiocephalic veins and the SVC showed no opacification\\, and the presence of extensive collateral veins in the right chest wall was consistent with venous occlusion and SVC syndrome (Figure 1B and 1C). An incidental cyst was noted in the upper pole of the left kidney. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion. There was no other evidence of cancer in the abdomen. The diagnostic possibilities included non\u2013small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\\, small-cell lung cancer\\, metastasis from extrathoracic cancer\\, and lymphoma. Granulomatous infection and fibrosing mediastinitis were less likely in this case\\, given the imaging findings. FIGURE 1  CT of the Chest. Angiography performed the next day confirmed that there was no opacification of the subclavian and brachiocephalic veins or the SVC and that extensive collateral veins were present in the arms. After removal of some of the clots\\, multiple overlapping stents were placed in the internal jugular veins\\, the brachiocephalic veins\\, and the SVC (Figure 1D and 1E and Video 1\\, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Dr. Colleen M. Keyes: On the fourth hospital day\\, rigid bronchoscopy revealed diffusely friable mucosa and dynamic airway narrowing of the right main-stem bronchus. Much of the airway narrowing appeared to be due to extrinsic compression (Figure 2). Balloon dilation of the airway was performed but did not result in resolution of the airway narrowing; therefore\\, an endobronchial stent was not placed. Endobronchial ultrasonography revealed a 1.5-cm mass near the carina\\, and transbronchial needle aspiration was subsequently performed. FIGURE 2  Photograph Obtained during Bronchoscopy. Dr. Daniel Shepherd: During fine-needle aspiration of the subcarinal mass\\, a rapid on-site evaluation of the specimen was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (Figure 3A and 3B) showed clusters of large epithelioid cells with anisonucleosis\\, irregularly contoured nuclei\\, prominent nucleoli\\, and occasional binucleated forms. There was a moderate amount of thin\\, delicate eosinophilic cytoplasm with occasional intracytoplasmic mucin. These findings are consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. No morphologic features of small-cell carcinoma were seen\\, and immunohistochemical staining for neuroendocrine markers and for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was negative.

He had reduced range of motion of the neck due to pain with flexion\\, extension\\, and rotation\\, but there was no spinal tenderness. There were small ulcers on the lower lip and gingivae. Cyclobenzaprine and acyclovir were prescribed. Five weeks before the current admission\\, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician in a clinic at this hospital. He reported that neck pain on the right side and oral ulcers had persisted and that several new oral ulcers had developed. He had no rash\\, eye pain\\, joint pain or swelling\\, dysuria or genital lesions\\, abdominal pain\\, or diarrhea. The examination was notable for several large ulcers on the lips and tongue (Figure 1A). Treatment with acyclovir was continued.

Four weeks before the current admission\\, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital. Erythema and watering of the left eye had developed\\, as had new skin lesions on the trunk and upper face. The examination revealed multiple ulcers on the lips and tongue (Figure 1B) and two pink crusted papules with hemorrhage on the right temple. There were scattered pustules on the lower back and right flank. An ophthalmologic examination revealed a pinguecula on the nasal side of the right eye with mild surrounding inflammation but was otherwise normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal\\, as were results of kidney- and liver-function tests. HLA typing was positive for the HLA-B51 allele; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology and dermatology services. The decision was made to pursue a skin biopsy before an oral biopsy. A biopsy of a pustule on the patient\u2019s back was performed\\, and examination of the specimen revealed mild spongiosis\\, neutrophilic granulomatous inflammation\\, and a superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils and occasional eosinophils. Colchicine was prescribed\\, along with oxycodone and lidocaine oral solution\\, for the treatment of a working diagnosis of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. Outpatient follow-up with the rheumatology service was arranged. Three days after discharge from the emergency department\\, the patient reported that the oral ulcers had not abated. Treatment with prednisone was started\\, and colchicine was continued. Two weeks before the current admission\\, the patient was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. Prednisone treatment had led to only transient healing of the oral ulcers. The patient had pain with eating and speaking and had lost 10 kg of body weight in 3 weeks. The neck pain\\, the eye watering\\, and several skin lesions had resolved. The examination revealed extensive ulceration of the upper and lower labial mucosa and of the ventrolateral surface of the tongue on both sides\\, as well as two focal ulcerations\\, measuring 0.5 cm in diameter\\, involving the soft palate on the left side (Figure 1C and 1D). There were multiple purple-red\\, scaly papules involving the skin of the arms and lower legs. There was no evidence of a joint abnormality. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Prednisone was switched to oral methylprednisolone\\, and treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was started for possible bowel-associated dermatosis\u2013arthritis syndrome. Omeprazole\\, which the patient had taken for many years\\, was stopped because of peripheral eosinophilia. An evaluation in the oral medicine clinic at an affiliated hospital was arranged\\, with plans for oral and skin biopsies. One week before the current admission\\, a biopsy of lower labial mucosa revealed squamous mucosa and parenchyma of the minor salivary glands\\, with mild nonspecific chronic inflammation. A skin biopsy was notable for epidermal ulceration with impetiginization and associated folliculitis. Dexamethasone oral rinses were prescribed\\, as was trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci infection. During the next 7 days\\, the ulcers worsened and the patient had ongoing pain that was unresponsive to oxycodone. He was unable to eat and was admitted to this hospital for pain control and further evaluation. The patient\u2019s medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included methylprednisolone\\, colchicine\\, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate\\, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole\\, lorazepam\\, and oxycodone\\, as well as dexamethasone oral rinses. The patient was allergic to clarithromycin\\, which had caused a rash. He had quit smoking 30 years earlier\\, and he consumed 10 alcoholic drinks per week. There was no illicit drug use. The patient lived with his wife in a suburban area of New England. He had traveled to Western Europe\\, Mexico\\, and the Caribbean. He was employed part-time as a contractor. His family history included prostate cancer in his father and type 2 diabetes mellitus in his mother. On examination\\, the temperature was 35.8\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 134/56 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 70 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.4. The patient looked uncomfortable\\, with an edematous tongue and multiple oral ulcers. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy or joint abnormality. Skin examination revealed a slightly raised pustule\\, measuring 2 mm in diameter\\, on the anterior aspect of the thigh. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Markus Y. Wu: Computed tomography (CT) of chest and abdomen\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed subtle centrilobular ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of the lungs\\, as well as prominent right hilar and left supraclavicular lymph nodes\\, each measuring 1 cm in diameter (Figure 2).

Surgical history included tooth extraction for a painful dental abscess 6 weeks before admission to the other hospital\\, appendectomy\\, arthroplasty of the left hip after a fall 3 years earlier\\, and repair of a meniscus tear in the left knee. Medications included oxacillin administered intravenously every 4 hours and oral furosemide\\, sotalol\\, rivaroxaban\\, levothyroxine\\, and tamsulosin. He had had no known adverse drug reactions. The patient was retired and lived with his spouse. He reported that\\, before his admission to the other hospital\\, he had been riding a bicycle a few miles several times per week. He had previously smoked cigarettes but had quit 30 years earlier; he consumed one beer weekly and used no other substances. His family history was notable for atrial fibrillation. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 83 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg\\, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued. The jugular venous pressure was elevated\\, at 15 cm of water. The cardiac impulse was discrete and was not displaced. Auscultation of the chest revealed an irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm\\, with a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex that did not change with respiration\\, and bibasilar crackles. There was 2+ pitting edema in the legs. A peripherally inserted central catheter was present in the right arm. The blood levels of calcium\\, magnesium\\, albumin\\, lipase\\, glycated hemoglobin\\, alkaline phosphatase\\, and bilirubin were normal\\, and a screening test for human immunodeficiency virus antigen and antibodies was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of blood were obtained. An electrocardiogram (Figure 1B) showed atrial fibrillation\\, multifocal ventricular premature beats\\, and right bundle-branch block. TABLE 1  Laboratory and Hemodynamic Data.

The tip of a peripherally inserted central catheter was appropriately positioned in the lower superior vena cava. Dr. Dudzinski: Treatment with intravenous oxacillin and furosemide was continued. TEE (Figure 1D) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a normal-sized left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 61%\\, dilatation of the right ventricle with normal function\\, dilatation of both atria\\, mitral-valve perforation and thickening\\, severe mitral regurgitation due to mitral-valve perforation\\, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with a right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg (also see Videos 1 and 2\\, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Coronary angiography revealed 70% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and 90% stenosis in the middle right coronary artery. On hospital day 11\\, cardiac surgery was performed. The patient underwent bioprosthetic mitral-valve replacement\\, along with two-vessel coronary-artery bypass grafting and amputation of the left atrial appendage. TEE performed after the surgical procedure revealed a well-seated mitral prosthesis with trace central regurgitation\\, as well as mild biventricular systolic dysfunction. Subsequently\\, on transfer to the intensive care unit\\, the blood pressure was 108/52 mm Hg and the cardiac index 3.0 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area while the patient was receiving epinephrine (at a rate of 2 \u03bcg per minute)\\, norepinephrine (10 \u03bcg per minute)\\, and vasopressin (0.04 U per minute). An electrocardiogram (Figure 1E) showed atrial fibrillation\\, right bundle-branch block\\, and ventricular premature beats. During postoperative day 1\\, the patient had increased ventricular ectopy and a 25-beat run of ventricular tachycardia. Laboratory and hemodynamic data are shown in Table 1. Dr. Stib: An anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure 1F) showed left atrial enlargement\\, bilateral pulmonary edema\\, and basilar atelectasis\\, along with sternotomy wires\\, an endotracheal tube\\, a catheter in the right main pulmonary artery\\, bilateral chest tubes\\, and a mediastinal drain. Dr. Dudzinski: Treatment with intravenous amiodarone was started\\, and the epinephrine infusion was discontinued. On postoperative day 2\\, the trachea was extubated\\, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued. The cardiac index had decreased to less than 2.0 liters per minute per square meter\\, and intravenous milrinone was initiated. The next day\\, a 35-beat run of ventricular tachycardia occurred. On postoperative day 4\\, given that the cardiac index was less than 1.9 liters per minute per square meter\\, intravenous dopamine was started. On postoperative day 5\\, deep-vein thrombosis was identified in the right lower leg\\, and treatment with warfarin was started. A truncal macular rash was noted. TTE revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 32%\\, right ventricular dysfunction\\, atrial dilatation\\, trace central prosthetic mitral regurgitation with a mean transmitral gradient of 5 mm Hg measured at 70 beats per minute\\, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (see Video 3). There was also worsening renal function. Milrinone was stopped and epinephrine initiated. On postoperative day 8\\, microbiologic cultures obtained during the surgical procedure showed no growth; the patient\u2019s oxacillin treatment was switched to cefazolin. During the next few days\\, the rash became more confluent and extended to the face\\, back\\, arms\\, and neck in addition to the trunk\\, but there was no mucosal involvement. Examination of the joints was normal\\, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. The arms and legs were cool\\, and urine output had decreased\\, despite continued therapy with intravenous epinephrine\\, norepinephrine\\, and dopamine. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Repeat TTE on postoperative day 13 revealed borderline left ventricular dilatation with an ejection fraction of 37%\\, right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction\\, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation. Additional diagnostic tests were performed\\, and management decisions were made.,Eosinophilic myocarditis and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)."

Ten years before this evaluation\\, the patient was seen by her primary care physician because of several weeks of nonproductive cough\\, nasal congestion\\, and intermittent wheezing; she received prescriptions for oral loratadine and inhaled pirbuterol\\, to be taken as needed. Eight years before this evaluation\\, she was referred to an allergist. She was considered to have a cough in response to angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme inhibitors. Six years 3 months before this evaluation\\, she consulted with another allergist. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. The blood IgE level was 1532 kU per liter (reference range at other institution\\, <127)\\, with positive titers in response to cat dander\\, dog dander\\, and dust mites. Inhaled fluticasone was prescribed. Three months later\\, she had mild dyspnea on exertion and occasional wheezing. Pulmonary-function tests showed minimal change (Table 1); inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol was prescribed. Five years 9 months before this evaluation\\, the patient was referred for pulmonary consultation. She reported intermittent wheezing\\, mild exertional dyspnea after climbing two flights of stairs or carrying groceries\\, occasional gastroesophageal reflux\\, and snoring. The heart rate was 72 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 95% while she was breathing ambient air at rest. Examination revealed upper-airway wheezing and was otherwise normal. After the patient climbed four flights of stairs\\, the heart rate was 102 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 91% while she was breathing ambient air. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Blood levels of electrolytes\\, urea nitrogen\\, creatinine\\, and hemoglobin were normal\\, as was the platelet count; the white-cell count was 11\\,900 per microliter (reference range\\, 4500 to 11\\,000) and the eosinophil count was 390 per microliter (reference range\\, <600)\\, with a relative eosinophil count of 3.2% (reference range\\, 0 to 3). Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels were undetectable. Dr. Amita Sharma: Chest CT\\, performed without the administration of contrast material\\, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation\\, as well as several lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis. Dr. Medoff: The patient was seen by an otolaryngologist. External and fiberoptic examinations\\, including examination of the vocal cords\\, were normal. A sleep study revealed mild sleep apnea\\, with an apnea\u2013hypopnea index of 7.2 events per hour (reference range\\, <5). The patient was unable to receive supplemental oxygen at night and positive-pressure ventilation owing to side effects. Five years before this evaluation\\, the patient underwent cardiac evaluation because of ongoing dyspnea on exertion. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Results of an exercise stress test (treadmill test) were submaximal\\, with a maximum heart rate at 74% of the age-predicted value but without abnormal findings on electrocardiography. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Three months later\\, the patient attended follow-up with her pulmonologist; inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol was substituted for inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol\\, and weight loss was advised. Dr. Sharma: Four years before this evaluation\\, repeat chest CT\\, performed without the administration of contrast material\\, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. All the findings were stable from the previous CT scan. Dr. Medoff: The patient was seen by a second pulmonologist\\, and inhaled budesonide was substituted for inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol for the treatment of mild intermittent asthma. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 4 years before this evaluation are shown in Table 1. Subsequently\\, the patient was evaluated annually by her first pulmonologist\\, but after 3 years\\, she consulted with a third pulmonologist regarding recurrent dyspnea on exertion. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 7 months before this evaluation are shown in Table 1. Dr. Sharma: At that time\\, chest CT\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and a nodule measuring 6 mm in diameter in the posterior right upper lobe\\, along with other\\, diffuse lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. Dr. Medoff: The blood hemoglobin level\\, platelet count\\, and white-cell count were normal; the eosinophil count was 437 per microliter\\, with a relative eosinophil count of 4.9%. The ANA titer was 1:1280\\, with a homogeneous staining pattern. The IgE level was 2685 kU per liter (reference range at other institution\\, <114)\\, with positive titers in response to cat dander\\, dog dander\\, dust mites\\, and Cladosporium herbarum. Treatment with oral montelukast and inhaled fluticasone\u2013umeclidinium\u2013vilanterol was started\\, along with supplemental oxygen to be used at night and with exertion. After 1 month\\, the patient\u2019s symptoms had not abated\\, and subcutaneous benralizumab was prescribed. Three months before this evaluation\\, the patient\u2019s symptoms remained unchanged. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. One month later\\, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography and CT revealed no areas of abnormal FDG avidity in the lungs. Eight weeks later\\, the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. The patient reported intermittent wheezing and progressive mild exertional dyspnea after climbing one to two flights of stairs. She had stopped playing a team aerobic sport because of difficulty breathing. The symptoms did not abate with use of the inhaler or benralizumab; they never occurred at rest. She occasionally had a nonproductive cough without hemoptysis\\, and she had a \u201craspy\u201d voice that had become worse in recent months. Coryza\\, nasal congestion\\, and watery eyes were not present. She had gained 15 kg during the previous 5 years. The patient\u2019s medical history included eczema\\, hypothyroidism\\, obesity\\, dyslipidemia\\, hypertension\\, borderline diabetes\\, calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis\\, glaucoma\\, and colonic polyps. She had undergone tonsillectomy and multiple procedures for the treatment of nephrolithiasis\\, including shock-wave lithotripsy and ureteroscopy. Medications included oral aspirin\\, amlodipine\\, atenolol\\, atorvastatin\\, atovaquone\\, levothyroxine\\, loratadine\\, losartan\\, and montelukast\\, along with a multivitamin; inhaled fluticasone\u2013umeclidinium\u2013vilanterol; and subcutaneous benralizumab. Sulfa drugs had caused anaphylaxis\\, lisinopril had caused a cough\\, and macrolides had caused diarrhea. The patient worked as an educator. She had no known exposure to asbestos\\, mold\\, solvents\\, or chemicals. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not have secondhand exposure to tobacco; she drank one glass of wine per week and did not use illicit drugs. She had traveled to coastal areas of Florida and Massachusetts\\, as well as other areas of New England\\, but she had not traveled to other areas of the United States or outside the country. The patient was married and lived in Massachusetts with her spouse. There had been no pets in her home for approximately 10 years. There were no damp areas in her home; she used a vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter and allergen-proof bedsheets. The patient\u2019s family history was notable for coronary artery and peripheral artery disease in her father\\, a sister\\, and her brother; skin cancer in her mother; breast cancer in a sister; and hypertension and diabetes in multiple relatives. She had two healthy adult children. There was no history of allergic\\, immunologic\\, pulmonary\\, or rheumatologic disease. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 67 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 142/91 mm Hg\\, and the oxygen saturation 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air. After she climbed two flights of stairs\\, the oxygen saturation was 87% while she was breathing ambient air. She had a cushingoid appearance. The nasal and oral mucosa appeared normal. There was no tracheal deviation or stridor. Lung auscultation revealed normal breath sounds. There was no clubbing or edema. Mild scattered eczematous plaques were present on the forearms and shins. There were mild Heberden\u2019s nodes but no other joint\\, skin\\, or nail abnormalities. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood hemoglobin level\\, white-cell count\\, differential count (with 0% eosinophils)\\, platelet count\\, erythrocyte sedimentation rate\\, and creatine kinase level were normal. The IgE level was 1307 IU per milliliter (reference range at this hospital\\, 0 to 100)\\, and a hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel was negative. The thyrotropin level was 8.07 \u03bcIU per milliliter (reference range\\, 0.40 to 5.00)\\, and the aldolase level 9.3 U per liter (reference range\\, <7.7). The ANA titer was 1:5120\\, with a homogeneous and speckled staining pattern; the anticytoplasmic antibody titer was 1:1280\\, with a filamentous and granular staining pattern; and ANCA testing was negative. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Ten weeks after evaluation\\, at follow-up in the pulmonary clinic\\, a myositis antibody panel was negative\\, except for a weakly positive titer in response to anti-Ku antibodies. Tests were negative for ANCA\\, anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide\\, rheumatoid factor\\, and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA\\, anti-Ro\\, anti-La\\, anti-Smith\\, antiribonucleoprotein\\, antitopoisomerase I (anti\u2013Scl-70)\\, antimitochondrial\\, antithyroperoxidase\\, and anti\u2013histidyl\u2013transfer RNA synthase (anti\u2013Jo-1) antibodies. Dr. Sharma: Chest CT (Figure 1A and 1B)\\, performed without the administration of contrast material\\, revealed diffuse bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules\\, including a 6-mm nodule in the right upper lobe. There was no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis\\, bronchiectasis\\, or lymphadenopathy. FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies of the Chest. Dr. Medoff: Five days later\\, the patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at this hospital. A tapering course of oral prednisone was prescribed for the treatment of possible interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features. Ten weeks after the visit with the rheumatologist\\, the eczematous rash had improved but dyspnea on exertion persisted during long walks. An examination in the pulmonary clinic was notable for clear lung fields and an oxygen saturation of 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Dr. Sharma: Chest CT\\, performed without the administration of contrast material\\, again showed extensive bilateral mosaic attenuation and numerous bilateral solid lung nodules\\, with the largest nodule\\, measuring 6 mm in diameter\\, located in the right upper lobe. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis or reticulation. Expiratory CT (Figure 1C and 1D) confirmed the presence of air trapping. Diagnostic tests were performed.,Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia."

The patient was no longer able to drive or play golf\\, and he intermittently used a walker because of unsteadiness. He had frequent falls\\, including one that led to fractures in six ribs. His speech changes worsened\\, such that he could no longer sing. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for evaluation. In the neurology clinic\\, the patient reported frequent bowel movements\\, approximately 10 per day. He had no vertigo\\, lightheadedness\\, hearing loss\\, tremor\\, erectile dysfunction\\, disturbance of sleep\\, or urinary incontinence. He reported a sense of visual disorientation with head movement and with changes in the direction of gaze. He had a history of hyperlipidemia. Medications included atorvastatin\\, cetirizine\\, and a multivitamin; there were no known drug allergies. The patient had recently moved from an urban area in the southeastern United States to a suburban area of New England. He drank one glass of wine nightly; additional alcohol use caused worsening of ataxia and dysarthria. He had previously smoked five cigarettes daily but had quit smoking 30 years before this evaluation; he did not use illicit drugs. The patient\u2019s mother had died of heart failure at an elderly age\\, and his father had died after a stroke and myocardial infarction at 70 years of age. The patient had two adult children\\, who were healthy. His two brothers and one of his sisters had celiac disease; the sister also reportedly had a shuffling gait. The sister\u2019s daughter had received a diagnosis of Turner\u2019s syndrome and had been seen by a neurologist for a balance disturbance. A brother\u2019s grandson also had celiac disease and a gait disturbance (Figure 1). FIGURE 1  Family History. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg\\, and the pulse 72 beats per minute. The patient was alert\\, oriented\\, and attentive and provided a detailed history. He had moderate dysarthria\\, with impairment in the rate\\, rhythm\\, and clarity of speech. An oculomotor examination revealed complete and conjugate gaze in all directions; he had intact smooth pursuit movements but had slow\\, dysmetric saccades. Results of a head impulse test were abnormal\\, with corrective saccades noted bilaterally. Normal tone and full strength were present in all major muscle groups of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric at the knees but absent at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Rapid tapping of the index fingers on the thumbs was dysrhythmic and uncoordinated. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing revealed mild intention tremor. Heel-to-shin testing revealed symmetric jerking movements with lateral movements across the shins. Vibration and joint-position senses in the legs were profoundly decreased: the patient was unable to sense vibration at the toes\\, had a decreased ability to sense vibration at the knees\\, and had difficulty discerning the position of his big toe with his eyes closed. There was sway in his stance\\, regardless of whether his eyes were open\\, and he could not stand with the feet together. The patient walked without support. He had a wide-based gait with considerable staggering and jerky\\, stiff movements of the legs. He was unable to maintain balance in a tandem stance or to walk with a tandem gait. The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes were normal\\, as were test results for kidney\\, liver\\, and thyroid function; antibodies to thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin were not detected. Blood levels of cyanocobalamin\\, methylmalonic acid\\, vitamin E\\, and glycated hemoglobin were normal; anti\u2013glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were not detected. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Genetic testing revealed no mutations in genes associated with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1\\, 2\\, 3\\, 6\\, and 8. Clinical testing of otolith function revealed abnormal vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials on the left side. Nerve-conduction studies revealed absent or barely detectable responses in the bilateral sural nerves\\, left superficial peroneal nerve\\, left median nerve\\, left ulnar nerve\\, and right radial nerve. Results of motor nerve-conduction studies were normal\\, as were results of a modified barium-swallow evaluation. A previous workup at another hospital for chronic diarrhea had reportedly been normal\\, with no evidence of malabsorption. Dr. McKinley Glover: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2)\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss and prominent cerebellar volume loss\\, most notably involving the vermis and superior cerebellar hemispheres. There was mild flattening of the superior margin of the midbrain\\, and the ratio of midbrain to ventral pons was mildly reduced at 0.51 (reference range\\, >0.52).1 The anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain was 8.90 mm (reference range\\, >9.35).1 There was no abnormal signal in the pons\\, and the middle cerebellar peduncles were normal. There was a chronic lacunar infarct of the right thalamus. FIGURE 2  MRI of the Head. Dr. de Gusmao: Additional history was obtained\\, and a diagnosis was made.,Cerebellar ataxia\\, neuropathy\\, and vestibular areflexia syndrome due to a biallelic expansion in RFC1."

    "user_input": "Dr. Javier A. Suarez (Neurology): A 32-year-old man was admitted to this hospital after 2 weeks of confusion and headache and 2 days of fever. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 month before admission\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "when his wife noted that he began to have behavior suggestive of anxiety. Two weeks before admission\\, his wife noted that he began to have confusion; for example\\, he was unable to recall the ages of his children or to correctly identify the date. At that time\\, headache and neck stiffness developed. Two days before admission\\, fever developed. On the day of admission\\, the patient had worsening confusion and somnolence\\, and his wife brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On presentation\\, the patient was not able to provide any history but was accompanied by his wife\\, who described his recent symptoms. His medical record showed a 10-year history of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\\, which had initially been complicated by oral and genital ulcers and intermittent fever. During the following decade\\, flares of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had been associated with various manifestations: pulmonary embolism\\, iliac artery aneurysm and dissection\\, bilateral renal vein thrombosis\\, erythema nodosum\\, deep venous thrombosis\\, uveitis\\, an inferior vena cava clot complicated by superior vena cava syndrome that led to thrombectomy\\, and renal infarction. The flares of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had usually included oral ulcers\\, genital ulcers\\, uveitis\\, or fever. Past treatment for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had included azathioprine\\, cyclosporine\\, and prednisone. Two years before this presentation\\, treatment with azathioprine and cyclosporine was discontinued and adalimumab initiated. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone resulted in flares of genital and oral ulcers. The frequency of adalimumab administration was increased to weekly\\, but genital and oral ulcers persisted. Thirteen months before this presentation\\, treatment with adalimumab was stopped and infliximab initiated. Diffuse arthralgias developed that were attributed to infliximab. Twelve months before this presentation\\, treatment with infliximab was stopped and golimumab initiated. Other medical history included an episode of lymphocyte-predominant meningitis\\, which had been diagnosed during an evaluation for headache\\, fever\\, and neck pain 17 months before this presentation. During the episode\\, there was a 72-hour delay in performing lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis because the patient had been taking apixaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. While he was awaiting lumbar puncture\\, broad-spectrum antibiotic agents were administered\\, and the headache\\, fever\\, and neck pain resolved. CSF analysis revealed normal levels of glucose and total protein\\, no red cells\\, and a nucleated-cell count of 88 per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 5)\\, with 97% lymphocytes and 3% monocytes. Nucleic acid amplification testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was negative\\, and Gram\u2019s staining revealed no organisms. Antimicrobial therapy was discontinued\\, and the patient was discharged home. There was also a history of coronavirus disease 2019\\, which had been diagnosed 16 months before this presentation. Current medications included golimumab\\, apixaban\\, prednisone\\, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. There were no known allergies. The patient lived with his wife and four children. He had previously worked in construction; he had been released from prison 3 months before this presentation and was not currently working. He had a remote history of smoking tobacco; he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His grandmother had hypertension. On examination in the emergency department\\, the patient was somnolent but arose in response to verbal stimuli. His level of alertness fluctuated\\, he was only intermittently able to answer simple questions\\, and he could not provide a coherent history of his illness. The temperature was 39.5\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 122/71 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 81 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.7. He was oriented to person and place but not to time. There was no neck stiffness. Mild injection in the left eye was present\\, but there were no oral or skin lesions. The patient was not able to participate fully in a neurologic examination\\, but he was able to move his arms and legs; no focal neurologic findings were noted on observation. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal\\, as were results of liver-function\\, kidney-function\\, and coagulation tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The blood acetaminophen level was less than 5.0 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range\\, 0.0 to 25.0); blood testing for ethanol was negative. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for respiratory viral pathogens was positive for human rhinovirus or enterovirus. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. Imaging studies were obtained.

CT angiography of the head and neck\\, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed normal arterial and venous vasculature. Dr. Suarez: Treatment with vancomycin\\, ceftriaxone\\, ampicillin\\, and acyclovir was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with apixaban was stopped and heparin administered intravenously in anticipation of performing a lumbar puncture. Fever and headache abated\\, but the patient\u2019s mental status did not improve. Blood cultures showed no growth. On the fourth hospital day\\, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was not obtained. CSF analysis revealed a normal total protein level\\, a glucose level of 40 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter])\\, a red-cell count of 2 per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 5)\\, and a nucleated-cell count of 284 per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 5)\\, with 72% lymphocytes\\, 13% neutrophils\\, 11% monocytes\\, and 4% unclassified cells. Nucleic acid amplification testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was negative\\, and Gram\u2019s staining revealed no organisms. No acid-fast bacilli were observed on a mycobacterial smear\\, and no fungi were seen on examination of a fungal wet preparation. Testing of the CSF for cryptococcal antigen and enterovirus RNA was negative. Additional diagnostic testing was performed\\, and a diagnosis was made.,Encephalitis due to Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease."

Diarrhea had initially developed in the patient during infancy. When the patient was 2 months of age\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "he had poor growth and frequent bowel movements with loose stools. When he began to eat solid foods\\, diarrhea continued\\, and a hydrolyzed-protein diet was started. His parents were instructed to remove dairy\\, soy\\, and gluten from his diet\\, but diarrhea did not abate. Allergy skin-prick testing with cow\u2019s milk and soy antigens was negative. When the patient was 10 months of age\\, failure to thrive and diarrhea persisted\\, and generalized edema and nephrotic syndrome developed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed\\, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy\\, crypt hyperplasia\\, and diffuse inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy reportedly showed mild degenerative changes of the surface epithelium and mild focal microvillous atrophy; there were no immune deposits\\, and the basement membrane was normal. Renal biopsy was also performed\\, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen revealed glomeruli with diffuse thickening of the basement membrane; there was no proliferation of cells or mesangial matrix. Transmission electron microscopy showed total effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes and an irregularly thickened glomerular basement membrane with numerous subepithelial and intramembranous electron-dense deposits. The patient received a working diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome due to membranous glomerulonephritis\\, and treatment with prednisone was started. Diarrhea abated\\, proteinuria and generalized edema resolved\\, and growth resumed. However\\, during the next 2 years\\, intermittent relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome occurred when the dose of prednisone was decreased. When the patient was 3 years of age\\, treatment with chlorambucil was started for recurrent membranous glomerulonephritis\\, and there were no relapses for 1 year. When the patient was 4 years of age\\, there was a recurrence of diarrhea associated with fever and hemolytic anemia. Stool culture\\, stool testing for Clostridioides difficile toxin\\, and examination of the stool for ova and parasites were all negative. EGD was performed\\, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy\\, crypt hyperplasia\\, and active enteritis. The blood IgE level was 501 IU per milliliter (reference range\\, 0 to 100). The blood level of endomysial antibodies was not elevated\\, but anti\u2013epithelial cell antibodies were detected. The patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy\\, and treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was begun. After several months\\, treatment with glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was stopped\\, and tacrolimus was begun. Tacrolimus was stopped after several years\\, when the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved. From 5 to 13 years of age\\, he had no enteropathy\\, anemia\\, or nephropathy. Beginning at 13 years of age\\, the patient was hospitalized for recurrences of diarrhea and nephropathy every 2 to 4 years during the 20 years before this evaluation. Six years before this evaluation\\, EGD and colonoscopy were performed\\, and the duodenal and colonic mucosa appeared diffusely edematous. Biopsy specimens were obtained. Dr. Stuti G. Shroff: Examination of a duodenal biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed marked villous blunting\\, an increase in lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria (known as lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria)\\, and a patchy increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. Examination of a colonic biopsy specimen revealed mild focal active colitis that spared the rectum. FIGURE 1  Small-Intestinal Biopsy Specimens. Dr. Hatipoglu: Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was begun\\, and diarrhea abated. For the next 2 years\\, relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone in combination with cyclosporine\\, tacrolimus\\, and mycophenolate mofetil. Four years before this evaluation\\, antibodies against the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor were not detected. Renal biopsy was performed\\, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen again revealed evidence of membranous glomerulonephritis. Treatment was changed to prednisone\\, budesonide\\, and abatacept\\, and symptoms abated. After 2 years\\, the patient stopped taking abatacept. After another 2 years\\, diarrhea recurred\\, and the patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. In the gastroenterology clinic\\, additional history was obtained. There was a history of hypertension\\, gallstones\\, and rosacea. Eczema had developed when the patient was 10 months of age and had occurred intermittently into adulthood; it had abated with the administration of immunosuppressive agents. Anaphylactic shock had occurred when the patient was 2 years of age after he had been exposed to uncooked egg. At that time\\, allergy testing was performed\\, and the patient\u2019s parents were instructed to remove eggs\\, tree nuts\\, peanuts\\, fish\\, and shellfish from his diet\\, in addition to removing dairy\\, soy\\, and gluten. Current medications included prednisone\\, budesonide\\, and losartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a Mid-Atlantic state and worked as a salesperson. He did not smoke tobacco and drank beer rarely. His family history included ovarian cancer in his mother and skin cancer in his father; his brother was healthy. On examination\\, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 131/94 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 106 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.1. The patient had short stature and diffuse erythema of the face and neck. There was mild tenderness in the left lower abdomen. The results of a lactulose breath test were normal\\, as was the fecal calprotectin level. Testing for antibodies to tissue transglutaminase was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. EGD and colonoscopy were performed\\, and the findings were consistent with duodenitis\\, gastritis\\, and atrophy of the colon. Biopsy specimens were obtained. TABLE 1  Laboratory Data.

During the second admission to this hospital\\, 19 months before this admission\\, empirical doxycycline therapy was stopped\\, and empirical prednisone therapy was started\\, along with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Dr. Cochran: During the third admission\\, 18 months before this admission\\, CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis revealed worsening splenomegaly\\, with the spleen measuring 14.2 cm in length\\, and hepatic lesions that had increased in size and number. A percutaneous drain was placed in the largest hepatic lesion (Figure 1D)\\, which measured 4.0 cm in diameter. Dr. Andrews: Bacterial\\, mycobacterial\\, and fungal cultures of the drained fluid did not grow organisms; however\\, culture of the blood showed growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy\\, which revealed gastritis\\, esophagitis\\, and diverticulosis. Treatment with prednisone and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was stopped\\, intravenous ceftriaxone was started\\, and he was discharged home. The patient\u2019s fourth and fifth admissions occurred at the other hospital 17 months and 16 months before this admission\\, respectively. During the fourth admission\\, another percutaneous drain was placed in a dominant hepatic lesion\\, and cultures reportedly resulted in no growth. The patient received a course of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. During the fifth admission\\, cultures again reportedly showed no growth. The patient received another course of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and was discharged home with instructions to restart empirical doxycycline therapy. Dr. Cochran: The sixth admission also occurred at the other hospital\\, 1 month before this admission. CT of the abdomen revealed numerous new and enlarged hypodense hepatic lesions with new scattered subcentimeter splenic hypodensities (Figure 1E). Dr. Abahneh: Another liver biopsy was performed\\, which revealed liver parenchyma with abscess\\, acute inflammation and debris\\, and histiocytic and stromal reaction with histiocytic aggregates. Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver staining showed few bacteria\\, and a culture grew Escherichia coli; no acid-fast bacilli or fungal forms were detected. Dr. Andrews: Treatment with doxycycline was stopped\\, intravenous ceftriaxone was started\\, and the patient was discharged home with instructions to start taking ciprofloxacin. During the subsequent month\\, fever did not abate. The patient returned to this hospital for a seventh admission. Dr. Cochran: CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis showed stable scattered solid pulmonary nodules\\, new interstitial pulmonary edema\\, and increased splenomegaly\\, with the spleen measuring 15.0 cm in length. There was also an increase in the size and number of the hepatic and splenic hypodensities (Figure 1F). Dr. Andrews: The patient underwent EGD\\, which showed portal hypertensive gastropathy. TTE showed no vegetations. Aspiration of a hepatic lesion was performed\\, and a culture grew Enterococcus faecalis. Treatment with amoxicillin was started. A diagnostic test was performed.,Common variable immunodeficiency."

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 8 months before the current evaluation\\, when she fell and injured her right leg while hiking in a rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Before this injury\\, she had been traveling throughout the DRC for 1 month. She had hiked\\, walked barefoot\\, and gone swimming in freshwater lakes and rivers. Approximately 55 hours after the fall\\, the patient was transported to the trauma center of a regional hospital. Imaging studies revealed fractures of the right tibia with associated hemorrhage. Packed red cells were transfused\\, and an external fixation device was placed. Once the patient\u2019s condition was stable\\, she was transferred to a hospital in the United States.

One month before the current evaluation\\, the patient\u2019s weight had increased by 8.6 kg since the leg injury\\, and she took a 1-hour nap every afternoon because of fatigue. In addition\\, she had new abdominal bloating that did not abate with the use of probiotics. The patient sought evaluation at a clinic associated with the second hospital. On evaluation\\, the results of blood tests for thyroid\\, kidney\\, and liver function were normal\\, as were blood levels of electrolytes. A test for Lyme disease was negative. The results of testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)\u2013specific antibodies and other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Two weeks before the current evaluation\\, the patient moved to New England and established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. She continued to receive physical therapy for rehabilitation of the right leg. She reported that the weight gain\\, fatigue\\, and abdominal bloating had worsened at a rapid rate; her weight had increased by 13.6 kg since the leg injury. The patient was referred to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital. The patient had a history of chronic migraines and hyperlipidemia. Review of systems was notable for mild cough and swelling of the right knee that began after the surgery. She had no fever\\, hot flashes\\, night sweats\\, headache\\, shortness of breath\\, chest pain\\, abdominal pain\\, diarrhea\\, nausea\\, vomiting\\, myalgias\\, arthralgias\\, or rash. Current medications included levothyroxine and probiotics. There were no known allergies.

She currently lived in a suburban area of New England with her husband and cats in a house that had mold. She did not smoke tobacco\\, drink alcohol\\, or use illicit drugs. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 98/66 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 73 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.9. She appeared well. The lungs were clear on auscultation\\, and the abdomen was soft and nontender; there was no hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The right knee and leg had healed surgical scars. The skin examination was normal. The eosinophil count was 1760 per microliter. Tests for syphilis\\, human immunodeficiency virus infection\\, and strongyloidiasis were negative. The urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Vincent V. Dinculescu: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Figure 1)\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed calcified\\, nonenlarged subcarinal lymph nodes\\, along with calcified lesions in the right lung\\, liver\\, and spleen\\, findings suggestive of granulomatous disease. There was also a low-attenuation hepatic lesion measuring 1.6 cm in diameter\\, which was probably a cyst. FIGURE 1  CT of the Chest and Abdomen.

Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal\\, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed cholelithiasis and splenomegaly\\, with the spleen measuring 17 cm in the craniocaudal dimension (normal value\\, \u226412 cm). Two and a half months before admission\\, the patient was evaluated in a hematology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She reported persistent nausea and fatigue\\, poor appetite with reduced oral intake\\, and 2 weeks of dyspnea on exertion. There was no orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The weight was 83.2 kg\\, and the spleen tip was palpable four fingerbreadths below the costal margin; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A bone marrow biopsy was performed\\, and examination of the bone marrow specimen revealed mildly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and mild dyserythropoiesis. Treatment with prednisone and folic acid was begun. Ocrelizumab infusions for multiple sclerosis were stopped. Nausea and fatigue persisted\\, and fevers and sweats developed. After 3 weeks of treatment with prednisone\\, the anemia had not abated and the patient had temperatures as high as 39.0\u00b0C. Testing for influenza A and B viruses was negative. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The course of prednisone was tapered off over the next 18 days\\, and the patient was referred to a hematologist affiliated with this hospital. In the hematology clinic\\, the patient reported that the fevers had resolved but the fatigue\\, weakness\\, and poor appetite had worsened. She felt too fatigued to walk\\, and she had recently had a fall without loss of consciousness. The weight was 82.4 kg; splenomegaly was present\\, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. In addition to relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis\\, there was a history of trigeminal neuralgia\\, restless legs syndrome\\, vasovagal syncope when blood samples were obtained\\, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level for 1 year without a clear cause. Medications included oxcarbazepine\\, gabapentin\\, ropinirole\\, folic acid\\, and cholecalciferol. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had quit smoking 20 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her adult son and pet cat and dog. Her backyard adjoined a large wooded area where deer were often seen. She worked in health care administration. Her family history included diabetes in her mother\\, lung cancer in her father\\, and multiple sclerosis in her sister. On examination\\, the patient appeared pale but not unwell. The temperature was 38.3\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 90/54 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 93 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 93% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.2. The conjunctivae were pale. The heart rate was regular\\, with normal first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) and a soft systolic murmur. There was edema in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of homocysteine\\, methylmalonic acid\\, arsenic\\, cadmium\\, lead\\, and mercury were normal\\, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis and coagulation tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Two units of packed red cells were transfused\\, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was administered. Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered daily for 3 days\\, and the patient reported a decrease in weakness and fatigue. Dr. Dexter P. Mendoza: On hospital day 4\\, CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis (Figure 1A) revealed splenomegaly\\, with the spleen measuring 19 cm in the craniocaudal dimension. Concurrent positron-emission tomography with injection of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (Figure 1B) revealed intense uptake in the spleen and diffuse uptake in the bone marrow throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton. FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies. Dr. Miller: On hospital day 5\\, the patient reported a recurrence of severe fatigue and generalized weakness. The temperature was 39.0\u00b0C and the heart rate 130 beats per minute. The results of physical examination were otherwise unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

    "ground_truth_output": "arms\\, and legs. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 9 weeks before the current presentation\\, when she presented to another hospital because of intermittent slurred speech and dizziness that had lasted for 1 day. The score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was obtained; the NIHSS is an 11-component tool that assesses the severity of stroke\\, with scores ranging from 0 to 42 and higher scores indicating more severe neurologic deficits. Her NIHSS score was 1 owing to the presence of mild-to-moderate dysarthria\\, and she was not considered to be a candidate for treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, reportedly revealed a punctate focus of restricted diffusion associated with mild signal hyperintensity involving the deep white matter of the left frontal lobe on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. This finding was consistent with an acute ischemic infarct without hemorrhage or mass effect. There were also findings that had been observed on previous imaging\\, including foci of encephalomalacia in the right inferior frontal lobe and left occipital lobe that were related to previous trauma\\, a punctate old lacunar infarct in the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere\\, and superimposed patchy foci of T2-weighted and FLAIR white-matter hyperintensity most consistent with small-vessel disease. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed no intracranial or cervical occlusion\\, high-grade stenosis\\, or aneurysm. The patient was admitted to the hospital. The patient had been taking apixaban daily because of a history of two deep venous thromboses\\, and the treatment was continued. She had also been taking atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia\\, and the dose was increased. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no patent foramen ovale. Continuous telemetric monitoring showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation. Mobile cardiac telemetry was planned for the 30-day period after discharge. On the second hospital day\\, frequent irregular movements of the right leg developed\\, occurring every few seconds in a nonrhythmic pattern. The next day\\, similar movements of the right arm developed. The patient described the movements as involuntary and reported no uncontrollable urges or compulsions to move the arm or leg. Computed tomography (CT) of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, was reportedly negative for any new findings. Electroencephalography (EEG) was reportedly normal in the waking\\, drowsy\\, and light-sleep states. The dysarthria resolved\\, but the involuntary movements persisted. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day. During the next 6 weeks\\, involuntary movements involving the arms\\, legs\\, and tongue occurred with increasing frequency. The patient began using a walker. Nine days before the current presentation\\, the patient was again admitted to the other hospital after multiple falls at home\\, which she attributed to uncontrolled movements of her arms and legs. On examination\\, she had nearly constant writhing\\, nonrhythmic\\, dancelike movements of the arms\\, legs\\, and trunk\\, as well as rolling movements of the tongue. She could stand up from a chair while holding onto a walker. Scattered bruises were present on the lower legs. Imaging studies were obtained. CT of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, reportedly showed mild scattered parenchymal hypodensities without hemorrhage or evidence of an acute infarct. A presumptive diagnosis of vascular chorea was made\\, and the patient was treated with oral levetiracetam. On the third hospital day\\, MRI of the head was attempted but was limited by motion artifacts due to involuntary movements. There were small foci of restricted diffusion in the right frontal and parietal periventricular white matter within the right corona radiata and centrum semiovale\\, findings consistent with new small acute-to-subacute infarcts without hemorrhage or mass effect. On the fourth hospital day\\, the dose of levetiracetam was increased. EEG reportedly showed excessive irregular background slow-wave activity without focal\\, lateralizing\\, or epileptiform features; there were no findings that correlated to the movements of the head and body. On the fifth hospital day\\, the irregular movements had not abated\\, and treatment with levetiracetam was stopped. Treatment with low-dose clonazepam at bedtime was started to help with sleep. On the sixth hospital day\\, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. Three days after discharge\\, a family member observed that the patient was confused and unable to maintain a conversation. The family member brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department\\, the patient was not able to provide additional information. Other medical history\\, obtained from the family member\\, included hypothyroidism\\, hypertension\\, diabetes mellitus\\, hyperlipidemia\\, pulmonary hypertension\\, and vitiligo. Medications included ambrisentan\\, apixaban\\, atorvastatin\\, cholecalciferol\\, glipizide\\, levothyroxine\\, metformin\\, omeprazole\\, and sitagliptin. Clonazepam had not been administered at the rehabilitation facility. The patient had taken warfarin for many years for her history of two deep venous thromboses; 10 months before the current presentation\\, treatment had been switched from warfarin to apixaban. Acetylsalicylic acid had caused hives; there were no other known allergies. Before being discharged to the rehabilitation facility\\, the patient had lived alone in a suburban area and had worked in a school. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol rarely. Her father and brother had diabetes mellitus; there was no family history of abnormal movements or stroke. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg\\, the pulse 79 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.6. The patient was sleepy but arousable with verbal stimuli. She was oriented to self but not to time or place. She could follow simple commands with repeated instructions but could not follow complex commands. She had irregular spontaneous movements of the face\\, mouth\\, and tongue; she also had irregular spontaneous writhing movements of the arms and legs that were partially suppressible. When she was asked to hold her arms outstretched with the palms facing upward while keeping her eyes closed\\, her right arm drifted downward\\, and the palm pronated toward the floor. Strength was 4 out of 5 on right shoulder abduction\\, elbow flexion\\, elbow extension\\, wrist flexion\\, and wrist extension; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, and alkaline phosphatase were normal\\, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Urinalysis showed trace ketones and 1+ leukocyte esterase (reference value\\, negative); the urine sediment showed 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field (reference value\\, <10). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 44 mm per hour (reference range for women in the patient\u2019s age group\\, 0 to 40). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

MRI of the head (Figure 1)\\, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, showed multiple foci of restricted diffusion associated with T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperintensity\\, findings consistent with acute-to-early subacute infarcts. Foci were scattered throughout the cortex and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. The most prominent foci were located along the left temporo-occipital junction. Numerous foci involved the cortex of the frontal and parietal lobes along the precentral and postcentral gyri. There was a small punctate focus of restricted diffusion associated with T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperintensity in the right superior cerebellar hemisphere\\, a finding consistent with an additional small infarct. There was no associated hemorrhage or mass effect. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, showed no intracranial occlusion\\, high-grade stenosis\\, or aneurysm.

During the subsequent 3 days at home\\, fever again developed\\, with chills and a decreased appetite. The day before the current admission\\, the patient cried through the night. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The parents reported that the patient was fussy and had poor sleep and generalized weakness; there was no diarrhea or new rash. The parents did not think that the patient was in pain. Additional history was obtained from the parents. The patient had met developmental milestones until 1 month earlier\\, when he had stopped crawling. He had previously been able to pull his body into a standing position\\, but he no longer attempted this maneuver. If he was placed in a standing position\\, he collapsed; if he was placed in a sitting position\\, he was able to stay upright. He had previously passed objects from hand to hand\\, but he had a new preference of holding objects with the left hand. Two days before this evaluation\\, the parents had noticed that the patient no longer walked with support; he seemed to dislike having his hands held. The patient had cornea plana and a history of Hirschsprung\u2019s disease\\, for which he had undergone laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and an anal pull-through procedure at 2 months of age. Four months before the current evaluation\\, an intermittent diffuse rash on the trunk\\, arms\\, and legs had developed. The rash was characterized by purplish and pinkish plaques that appeared and varied in intensity of color throughout the day; it did not seem to be itchy or painful and usually resolved within 24 hours without treatment. Immunizations were up to date. Medications included metronidazole\\, acetaminophen\\, ibuprofen\\, and cetirizine\\, as well as carboxymethylcellulose eye drops; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient lived with his mother\\, father\\, and pet dog in a small town in New England\\, and he attended day care 5 days per week. His mother was healthy\\, and his father had irritable bowel syndrome and Poland syndrome (congenital aplasia of unilateral chest-wall muscles). His paternal grandmother had hypothyroidism\\, his maternal great-grandfather had had pancreatic cancer\\, his paternal great-grandfather had had breast cancer\\, a maternal second cousin had autism\\, and multiple maternal family members had Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. On examination\\, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 113/52 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 166 beats per minute (normal range for age\\, 80 to 160)\\, and the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute (normal range for age\\, 30 to 60). The patient was diaphoretic and irritable\\, and he cried during the examination. He had rhinorrhea. The abdomen was not distended or tender. There was limited extension of the wrists and knees\\, as well as limited inversion and eversion of the feet. The ankles were mildly stiff\\, and the feet were mildly swollen. There were erythematous plaques on the abdomen\\, back\\, arms\\, and legs (Figure 1). FIGURE 1  Clinical Photographs. The ferritin and d-dimer levels remained elevated\\, and the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 75 mm per hour\\, the white-cell count 26\\,820 per microliter (reference range\\, 6000 to 17\\,500)\\, and the platelet count 682\\,000 per microliter (reference range\\, 150\\,000 to 400\\,000). Blood cultures and urinalysis were normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Randheer Shailam: A radiograph of the chest and abdomen was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed cholelithiasis and prominent lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed a small amount of joint fluid in the hips and knees (Figure 2); the amount of fluid appeared to be within the normal range. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder\\, without gallbladder distention. There were a few prominent lymph nodes in the paraaortic\\, iliac\\, and inguinal regions (Figure 2). Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal coronary arteries. FIGURE 2  Imaging Studies. Dr. Materne: The empirical administration of intravenous vancomycin\\, cefepime\\, and metronidazole was begun.

The right radial pulse was normal\\, and sensation was intact in the arm and hand. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the right arm showed a mild transcondylar fracture of the right distal humerus. A splint was placed\\, and the patient was advised not to bear weight with the right arm. She was discharged to a skilled nursing facility for increased support with daily activities while she was recovering. Two weeks before the current admission\\, while the patient was staying in the skilled nursing facility\\, edema developed in both legs\\, and her weight increased by 5 kg. She attributed the weight gain to increased salt intake. Nine days before the current admission\\, oral metolazone was added to her diuretic regimen\\, and the leg edema resolved. At the time of the current admission\\, the patient reported nausea and abdominal cramps. She reported no fever\\, chills\\, cough\\, dyspnea\\, dysuria\\, flank pain\\, or vomiting. She had no known sick contacts.

One year before this presentation\\, the patient was evaluated in a neurology clinic affiliated with another hospital. He reported left foot drop\\, as well as occasional falls that he attributed to poor balance. Examination reportedly revealed wasting in the muscles below the left knee\\, weakness with attempts at dorsiflexion and eversion of the left ankle\\, loss of pinprick sensation to the midshins in both legs\\, and decreased vibratory sensation in the toes of both feet. The blood levels of cobalamin\\, folate\\, thyrotropin\\, and glycated hemoglobin and the results of serum protein electrophoresis were reportedly normal. Tests for syphilis and antinuclear antibodies were negative\\, as were blood tests for antibodies to sulfate-3-glucuronyl paragloboside and myelin-associated glycoprotein and a serum paraneoplastic autoantibody panel. The blood creatine kinase level was 456 IU per liter (reference range\\, 30 to 194) and the aldolase level 5.8 U per liter (reference value\\, <8.1). Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was reportedly normal. MRI of the lumbar spine reportedly revealed diffuse disk bulging with facet hypertrophy at multiple levels\\, which was contributing to mild spinal stenosis. Needle electromyography (EMG) of the left leg reportedly showed changes consistent with moderate-to-severe\\, subacute-to-chronic radiculopathy at L5 and S1 on the left side. The patient declined further workup at that time. One year later\\, his symptoms had not resolved\\, and he presented to the neurology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. On the current evaluation\\, the patient reported stable left foot drop and mild low-back pain without radiating symptoms. He had no bowel or bladder changes\\, no double vision or hearing changes\\, and no difficulty with breathing\\, chewing\\, or swallowing. His medical history included hypertension\\, dyslipidemia\\, and adenocarcinoma of the prostate\\, which had been treated with local radiation therapy 4 years before this presentation. Medications included aspirin\\, hydrochlorothiazide\\, lisinopril\\, metoprolol\\, and simvastatin. The patient was married\\, resided in New England\\, and was retired from work in the insurance industry. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit smoking 30 years before this presentation. He drank four alcoholic drinks per day. His sister had breast cancer\\, and his father had died in his 70s from esophageal cancer. On examination\\, the blood pressure was 140/60 mm Hg\\, the pulse 72 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.1. He had a steppage gait pattern with prominent left foot drop. He could not walk on his left heel\\, but he was able to walk on his left toes and to walk with a tandem gait. There was mild facial weakness\\, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side\\, with an asymmetric smile and weak eye closure and cheek puffing. The optic disks had sharp margins. The pupils were round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were full. There was no weakness or atrophy of the jaw\\, palate\\, or tongue. Hearing was grossly intact. Shoulder shrug was asymmetric\\, with less rise on the right side. A motor examination revealed wasting of the shoulder girdle\\, which was more prominent on the right side\\, and wasting of the calves. Tone was mildly decreased throughout\\, and there were no fasciculations. There was severe scapular winging\\, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side. There was no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. Strength was assessed according to the Medical Research Council scale\\, which ranges from 0 (no visible muscle contraction) to 5 (normal strength). On the right and left sides\\, strength was 4 and 4+\\, respectively\\, on shoulder abduction; 5 and 3 on ankle dorsiflexion; 4+ and 4 on big-toe extension; 5 and 4+ on ankle inversion; and 5 and 4\u2212 on ankle eversion. On both sides\\, strength was 4+ on hip flexion and was normal on neck flexion and extension\\, elbow flexion and extension\\, wrist flexion and extension\\, finger extension and abduction\\, thumb abduction\\, hip abduction\\, knee flexion and extension\\, and plantar flexion. Deep-tendon reflexes were 1+ at the biceps\\, 1+ at the triceps\\, trace at the brachioradialis\\, 2+ at the knees\\, and not elicited at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor. There was loss of pinprick and temperature sensations to the midshins in both legs\\, as well as decreased vibratory sensation to the ankles. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Karen A. Buch: MRI of the lumbar spine (Figure 1) revealed a large\\, leftward\\, eccentric disk herniation at L5 and S1 that impinged on the exiting L5 nerve roots\\, with greater impingement on the left side than on the right side. There was narrowing of the left subarticular zone and left lateral recess that encroached on the descending left S1 nerve root. Facet hypertrophy and ligamentous infolding at multiple levels were contributing to mild central spinal stenosis. FIGURE 1  MRI of the Lumbar Spine.

    "user_input": "Dr. Kathy M. Tran (Medicine): A 21-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of fatigue\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "weight gain\\, and abdominal pain. The patient had been well until 4 months before the current evaluation\\, when an episode of dull\\, aching pain in the right lower quadrant occurred. The pain lasted for a few hours before resolving spontaneously. During the next 4 months\\, episodes of abdominal pain continued to occur and increased in duration\\, frequency\\, and severity. The patient sought evaluation in the gynecology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation\\, the patient described the pain as variable\\, rating it between 3 and 8 on a scale of 0 to 10\\, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The episodes of pain occurred daily and lasted for up to 20 hours. The pain decreased with sitting or lying down and did not increase with movement; it was not associated with her menstrual period. The patient also reported fatigue\\, irritability\\, and weight gain of 4.5 kg in the previous 4 months despite increased exercise and decreased food intake. There was a history of hypothyroidism\\, anxiety\\, irritable bowel syndrome\\, and migraines. The patient had never been pregnant and had no known history of sexually transmitted infections or abnormal results on screening tests for cervical cancer. She had previously been sexually active with male partners\\, but she reported no current sexual activity. She had taken oral contraceptives for 2 years but had stopped taking them 6 months before this evaluation\\, when a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) was placed. Other medications included levothyroxine\\, citalopram\\, and multivitamins; there were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with roommates in an urban area of New England. She was a former athlete and worked as a research scientist. She did not smoke cigarettes\\, drink alcohol\\, or use illicit drugs. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her mother\\, coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia in her father\\, breast cancer and diabetes in her paternal grandmother\\, and lung cancer in her paternal grandfather. On examination\\, the blood pressure was 119/73 mm Hg and the heart rate 62 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The thyroid was firm on palpation\\, with a small nodule noted on the right side. The abdomen was nondistended\\, soft\\, and nontender. A small hernia with a thrill was noted at the right inguinal ring. A speculum examination of the vagina and cervix was normal; IUD strings were visible at the cervical os. The complete blood count was normal\\, as were blood levels of electrolytes and glucose and results of tests for kidney\\, liver\\, and thyroid function. Screening tests for gonorrhea\\, chlamydia\\, human immunodeficiency virus\\, and syphilis were negative. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Madeleine Sertic: Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass (measuring 4.8 cm by 5.0 cm by 3.9 cm) along the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe (Figure 1A). The uterus\\, ovaries\\, and adnexa were normal. There was no free fluid in the pelvis\\, and the IUD was in an appropriate position. FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a right adrenal mass (measuring 4.5 cm by 4.7 cm by 4.0 cm) that was T2 isointense (Figure 1B) and T1 hypointense. The mass had diffusion restriction (Figure 1C)\\, as well as early enhancement with washout\\, which refers to the temporal reduction in the enhancement of a lesion. The features were indeterminate and were not definitively diagnostic of adrenal adenoma or another adrenal lesion\\, such as pheochromocytoma or adrenocortical carcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis again revealed a right adrenal mass\\, which had a density of 33 Hounsfield units (HU) before the administration of contrast material (Figure 1D)\\, 74 HU during the portal-venous phase (Figure 1E)\\, and 45 HU during the 15-minute delayed phase (Figure 1F). The absolute washout was calculated as 71%. The absolute washout is calculated by dividing the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the delayed-phase density by the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the unenhanced density and then converting the result to a percentage: [(HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU delayed phase) / (HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU unenhanced)] \u00d7 100. Adrenal adenomas tend to wash out faster than other adrenal lesions\\, and an absolute washout of more than 60% is highly suggestive of an adrenal adenoma. However\\, lesions larger than 4 cm are likely to be malignant\\, regardless of the washout characteristics.1 There was also a thin-walled cyst (measuring 3.3 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the left lung. Dr. Tran: The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Additional laboratory tests were performed to further evaluate the adrenal mass. Blood levels of renin and aldosterone were normal\\, as were urinary levels of catecholamines and metanephrines. An overnight\\, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed. The baseline blood corticotropin level was 3 pg per milliliter (0.7 pmol per liter; reference range\\, 6 to 76 pg per milliliter [1.3 to 16.7 pmol per liter]). At 11 p.m.\\, dexamethasone (1 mg) was administered; at 8 a.m.\\, the blood cortisol level was 9.1 \u03bcg per deciliter (251 nmol per liter; reference value\\, <1.8 \u03bcg per deciliter [50 nmol per liter])\\, and the concurrent blood dexamethasone level was 631 ng per deciliter (reference range\\, 140 to 295). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 31.0 \u03bcg (reference range\\, 3.5 to 45.0); the blood levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were normal. Management decisions were made.,Adrenocortical carcinoma."

The patient had had limited medical care since she was 34 years of age. Three weeks before the current evaluation\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "she presented to another hospital with fever\\, confusion\\, and word-finding difficulties. At the time of that presentation\\, the patient was inattentive and disoriented\\, and mild expressive aphasia without motor deficits was present. She had a large\\, bleeding exophytic mass in the right breast. Dr. Janice N. Thai: Computed tomography (CT) of the head\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, reportedly revealed a wedge-shaped area of low density in the left temporoparietal region. This finding is consistent with acute infarction. Dr. Shahamatdar: A screening test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was positive. Laboratory studies\\, including a complete blood count\\, were notable for a hemoglobin level of 4.3 g per deciliter (reference range\\, 11.0 to 15.0)\\, a mean corpuscular volume of 69.7 fl (reference range\\, 80.0 to 100.0)\\, and a platelet count of 922\\,000 per microliter (reference range\\, 130\\,000 to 400\\,000). Dr. Thai: CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a large cystic and solid mass in the right breast\\, measuring 14.9 cm by 16.2 cm by 20.0 cm (Figure 1A and 1B). Associated prominence of the intramammary\\, internal mammary\\, subpectoral\\, and axillary lymph nodes was observed. Heterogeneous lesions of the ribs and pulmonary nodules that could indicate metastatic disease were also noted (Figure 1C). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head\\, performed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium\\, provided additional evidence of ischemic stroke and showed no evidence of intracranial metastases (Figure 1D and 1E). FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies. Dr. Shahamatdar: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Packed red cells were transfused\\, and a compressive bandage was applied to the breast lesion. By hospital day 2\\, the patient\u2019s confusion and inattention had resolved\\, but mild expressive aphasia persisted. Consent was obtained from the patient\\, and she underwent incisional biopsy of the breast lesion while under local anesthesia. The patient\u2019s hospitalization was complicated by cellulitis in the right arm at the site where a peripheral intravenous catheter had been placed\\, for which she was treated with intravenous antibiotic agents. She was discharged on hospital day 11 with pathological results pending\\, and follow-up was planned with the breast oncology clinic of this hospital. Four days after discharge\\, the patient had a sudden onset of profuse bleeding from the breast lesion\\, which led to hypotension\\, and she was again admitted to the other hospital. She received a total of 5 units of packed red cells\\, and bleeding was managed conservatively with sterile gauze and compressive bandaging. No further episodes of bleeding occurred. On hospital day 4\\, she was discharged home with plans to attend a multidisciplinary oncology evaluation at this hospital 2 days later. In the breast oncology clinic\\, the patient reported worsening discomfort\\, bleeding\\, and drainage from the breast mass and the associated wound. She noted that progressive fatigue had developed in recent weeks but reported no fever or chills. She had first noted a palpable lesion in the right breast when she was 32 years of age\\, approximately 27 years before the current presentation. The patient had pursued an evaluation with breast imaging at that time\\, and she recollected that the lesion had been characterized as a benign finding. A biopsy had not been performed. During the intervening years\\, she had not pursued routine medical care\\, including breast imaging. She attributed the lack of medical follow-up to ongoing demands related to caring for her young child and stressors in her personal and work life. She reported that slow but steady growth of the breast lesion had occurred during those years. Approximately 2 years before the current presentation\\, the patient had noted more rapid growth of the lesion with progressive skin breakdown\\, discomfort\\, and drainage that she thought was related to chronic infection. Menarche had occurred when the patient was 10 years of age and menopause at 50 years of age. The patient had had one pregnancy\\, and she had used hormonal contraception for a total of 15 years during her lifetime. She had not received any hormone-replacement therapy. At the time of the current presentation\\, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score was 1 (assessed on a scale of 0 to 5\\, with higher scores indicating greater disability). Medications included amlodipine\\, atorvastatin\\, ferrous sulfate\\, and polyethylene glycol. Her family history included breast cancer in her maternal aunt. She lived in New England with her adult son and was a small-business owner. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke cigarettes. On physical examination\\, the oral temperature was 36.5\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 136/81 mm Hg\\, the pulse 116 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A large\\, fungating breast mass was present\\, which had foci of necrosis and areas of dried blood without palpable ipsilateral lymphadenopathy. Auscultation of the heart was notable for tachycardia without murmur. A neurologic examination did not reveal motor deficits\\, and the previously reported expressive aphasia had resolved. The patient was attentive and oriented to person\\, place\\, time\\, and situation. The affect and mood were appropriate\\, and she did not report hallucinations\\, suicidal ideation\\, or symptoms of depression. She had normal insight and capacity with regard to the nature of her diagnosis and recent clinical course. Management decisions were made.,Metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma\\, originating in the breast."

    "ground_truth_output": "daytime sleepiness\\, and apnea detected on a home sleep study. Three years before the current evaluation\\, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that the patient had vocalizations\\, including talking and yelling\\, while sleeping. He also had thrashing movements while sleeping; he fell out of bed more than once and inadvertently hit his wife during these movements. Two years before the current evaluation\\, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that the patient had prolonged episodes of daytime sleepiness. During the episodes\\, he appeared to fall asleep while sitting up and was unresponsive to shaking and loud voices; several hours later\\, he returned to normal interaction without any intervention. The daytime sleepiness was intermittent and fluctuated in severity. Four months before the current evaluation\\, the patient fell asleep while washing dishes. This resulted in a fall and unstable C1 spinal fracture\\, which required urgent surgical repair. After the surgical repair\\, melatonin and trazodone were prescribed for insomnia\\, and abnormal movements during sleep abated. However\\, vocalizations during sleep \u2014 including singing\\, talking\\, and expression of fear and anger in the context of upsetting dreams \u2014 continued and were most prominent in the early morning hours. The patient also had a motor neurologic syndrome that had started before the onset of sleep symptoms\\, approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation. Symptoms included progressive gait imbalance with falls\\, hand clumsiness\\, hoarse voice\\, and dysphagia. Serial neurologic examinations\\, performed over a 3-year period by multiple neuromuscular specialists\\, revealed slow progression of generalized fasciculations and the development of bulbar hyperreflexia\\, postural instability\\, and hypophonia\\, although strength in the arms and legs remained intact. Serial electromyography revealed progressive and widespread involvement of muscles showing chronic reinnervation changes\\, including eventual involvement of craniobulbar muscles (tongue and masseter muscles). Dr. Brian Zhao: One year before the current evaluation\\, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine revealed moderate neural foraminal narrowing at the level of C3\u2013C4 bilaterally and no central canal stenosis. Four months before the current evaluation\\, MRI of the head revealed a punctate subacute infarct in the left posterior centrum semiovale\\, chronic infarcts in the left middle frontal gyrus and right cerebellum\\, and nonspecific moderate-to-severe white-matter changes (Figure 1). FIGURE 1  MRI of the Head. Dr. Babu: Blood tests for paraneoplastic\\, nutritional\\, and paraproteinemic causes of the patient\u2019s neurologic syndrome were unrevealing. A diagnosis of slowly progressive motor neuron disease was made\\, and therapy with riluzole was begun. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study revealed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with laryngeal penetration and silent aspiration; a gastrostomy tube was placed\\, and tube feeding was initiated. The patient underwent a home sleep-apnea test\\, which showed sleep-disordered breathing with an apnea\u2013hypopnea index of 20 events per hour; hypoxemia was present at rest while he was breathing ambient air. Severe oxygen desaturation occurred with frequent respiratory events while he was asleep in the supine position. The patient was then referred to the sleep clinic for an initial evaluation. On evaluation in the sleep clinic\\, the patient reported that obstructive sleep apnea had been diagnosed on the basis of a home sleep study performed 1 year earlier. Multiple attempts at treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) had been unsuccessful; there had been difficulty in finding a mask that fit comfortably. In addition to the sleep and motor neurologic syndrome described previously\\, the patient\u2019s symptoms included snoring\\, difficulty with sleep initiation\\, forgetfulness\\, poor judgment regarding his ability to safely complete physical tasks\\, urinary urgency and frequency\\, and night sweats. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus\\, which was well controlled with insulin and had been complicated by mild\\, stable\\, length-dependent sensory polyneuropathy; other history included hyperlipidemia\\, a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation\\, depression\\, orthostatic hypotension\\, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included alprazolam\\, bupropion\\, fenofibrate\\, insulin\\, melatonin\\, metformin\\, riluzole\\, sertraline\\, and trazodone; there were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in New England with his wife. He was a retired engineer. He drank two alcoholic beverages per day. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had died from an unknown cause at an elderly age; his father had died from trauma. One of his brothers had cerebrovascular disease\\, and another had schizophrenia. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 112/60 mm Hg\\, the pulse 83 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.2. The patient was awake\\, alert\\, and oriented\\, although his attention was somewhat diminished. He could recall two words out of three. Naming and repetition were intact. The pupils were equally reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements were intact\\, and visual fields were full. Facial sensation and strength were normal. Speech was hypophonic and mildly slurred. Elevation of the palate was symmetric\\, and movement of the tongue was normal. Shoulder shrug was symmetric. Strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups. Deep-tendon reflexes were brisk in the arms\\, with mild spasticity in the legs. Plantar responses were normal. Vibratory sensation in the legs was mildly diminished. Results of finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing were normal. There were mild myoclonic movements in both hands. Alternating movements were mildly clumsy. Tone was slightly increased in the legs. The gait was on a narrow base and was unsteady; the patient was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg test showed truncal titubation. A sleep study to determine the appropriate positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy was performed. In CPAP mode\\, there was good control of respiratory events. Electromyographic signals revealed elevated muscle tone during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep\\, but there were no abnormal behaviors. Two weeks later\\, during a follow-up visit in the neuromuscular clinic\\, the patient became unresponsive to sternal rub; the vital signs and blood glucose level were normal. He was transported to the emergency department\\, where he returned to a normal level of consciousness without intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed frequent intermittent diffuse polymorphic delta slowing of the background\\, often with bifrontal predominance\\, but showed no epileptiform abnormalities. The patient was fitted with a mask for CPAP\\, and treatment was initiated. Several weeks after the initiation of treatment\\, download of CPAP data revealed good effectiveness and adherence. However\\, episodes of unresponsiveness increased in frequency and lasted up to 3 hours at a time. During the episodes\\, the patient\u2019s wife was unable to arouse him despite performing a sternal rub. Modafinil was prescribed\\, but the episodes did not abate. The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for long-term monitoring and EEG. During the admission\\, two episodes of unresponsiveness occurred\\, during which the patient had a normal blood pressure\\, heart rate\\, and glucose level and EEG revealed findings consistent with sleep. A diagnostic test was performed.,Anti-IgLON5 IgG\u2013associated neurologic disorder."

She did not report fever\\, chills\\, abdominal pain\\, hematemesis\\, hemoptysis\\, epistaxis\\, rash\\, bruising\\, hematuria\\, or menorrhagia. The patient was congenitally deaf. She had received a diagnosis of kidney disease 12 years earlier\\, when proteinuria and hypertension developed during pregnancy and did not resolve postpartum. Pathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen had reportedly revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The patient was presumed to have Alport\u2019s syndrome; no genetic testing had been performed. Ten years before the current evaluation\\, the patient had discontinued all prescribed medications\\, including prednisone and labetalol\\, without talking to her doctors; 3 years later\\, she presented to this hospital with dyspnea on exertion and end-stage renal failure. Hemodialysis was started and continued until a deceased-donor renal transplantation was performed 6 months before the current evaluation. Routine pretransplantation serologic testing of the patient revealed IgG antibodies to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and no antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV). Serologic testing of the donor also revealed IgG antibodies to EBV and no antibodies to CMV. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin\\, belatacept\\, prednisone\\, and everolimus was initiated; famciclovir was administered for 3 months after transplantation. Treatment with prednisone was stopped 2 months after transplantation\\, when diabetes developed.

The patient lived with her male partner and young son in an urban area of New England. She had not traveled recently. She had previously worked part-time as a teacher. There had been no exposure to animals other than two pet dogs. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol. Her sister was deaf and had a history of renal failure that had led to renal transplantation. Her father had a history of diabetes and renal failure that required hemodialysis. On examination\\, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 85/46 mm Hg\\, the pulse 130 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared pale and unwell. There was no jaundice or lymphadenopathy. There were palatal petechiae and sublingual ecchymoses\\, but there was no bleeding from the gums or nose. There was a healed surgical incision in the right lower abdomen and no tenderness over the renal allograft. A rectal examination revealed tenderness and dark blood with clots. The hemoglobin level was 6.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 0 per microliter. A peripheral-blood smear showed red cells that were generally normal in size and morphology\\, with few hypochromic cells and rare pencil cells; there were no schistocytes or platelets. A direct antiglobulin test was negative. Blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Onofrio A. Catalano: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed no bowel-wall thickening or distention. The spleen and liver were normal in size. The renal allograft was visible in the right lower quadrant (Figure 1). The transplanted kidney was enlarged and surrounded by extensive perinephric fat stranding. A small amount of free fluid was also present. There was moderate hydroureteronephrosis that extended up to the ureterovesical anastomosis. The renal collecting system\\, pelvis\\, and ureter contained spontaneously hyperdense material that was suggestive of blood breakdown products. No obstructing calculi were seen. FIGURE 1  CT of the Renal Allograft. Dr. Roberts: Intravenous fluids were administered\\, and the blood pressure increased to 97/53 mm Hg. The patient was admitted to the hospital\\, and treatment with everolimus and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was stopped. During the next 24 hours\\, 4 units of packed red cells and 5 units of pooled platelets were transfused. On the second hospital day\\, the hemoglobin level was 11.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 4 per microliter. A diagnostic test was performed.,Cytomegalovirus-induced immune thrombocytopenia."

Three weeks before the current admission\\, the patient noticed waxing and waning \u201cthrobbing\u201d pain in the right upper abdomen\\, which she rated at 9 (on a scale of 0 to 10\\, with 10 indicating the most severe pain) at its maximal intensity. The pain was associated with nausea and fever with a temperature of up to 39.0\u00b0C. Pain worsened after food consumption and was relieved with acetaminophen. During the 3 weeks before the current admission\\, edema developed in both legs; it had started at the ankles and gradually progressed upward to the hips. When the edema began to affect her ambulation\\, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems that was obtained from the patient and her family was notable for intermittent fever\\, abdominal bloating\\, anorexia\\, and fatigue that had progressed during the previous 3 weeks. The patient reported new orthopnea and nonproductive cough. Approximately 4 weeks earlier\\, she had had diarrhea for several days. During the 6 weeks before the current admission\\, the patient had lost 9 kg unintentionally; she also had had pain in the wrists and hands\\, 3 days of burning and dryness of the eyes\\, and diffuse myalgias. She had not had night sweats\\, dry mouth\\, jaw claudication\\, vision changes\\, urinary symptoms\\, or oral\\, nasal\\, or genital ulcers. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for multiple myeloma (for which treatment with thalidomide and melphalan had been initiated 2 years earlier and was stopped approximately 1 year before the current admission); hypothyroidism; chikungunya virus infection (diagnosed 7 years earlier); seropositive erosive rheumatoid arthritis affecting the hands\\, wrists\\, elbows\\, and shoulders (diagnosed 3 years earlier); vitiligo; and osteoarthritis of the right hip\\, for which she had undergone arthroplasty. Evidence of gastritis was reportedly seen on endoscopy that had been performed 6 months earlier. Medications included daily treatment with levothyroxine and acetaminophen and pipazethate hydrochloride as needed for cough. The patient consumed chamomile and horsetail herbal teas. She had no known allergies to medications\\, but she had been advised not to take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs after her diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Approximately 5 months before the current admission\\, the patient had emigrated from Central America. She lived with her daughter and grandchildren in an urban area of New England. She had previously worked in health care. She had no history of alcohol\\, tobacco\\, or other substance use. There was no family history of cancer or autoimmune\\, renal\\, gastrointestinal\\, pulmonary\\, or cardiac disease.

She had a frail appearance and bitemporal cachexia. The weight was 41 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 15.2. Her dentition was poor; most of the teeth were missing\\, caries were present in the remaining teeth\\, and the mucous membranes were dry. She had abdominal tenderness on the right side and mild abdominal distention\\, without organomegaly or guarding. Bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy was palpable. Infrequent inspiratory wheezing was noted. The patient had swan-neck deformity\\, boutonni\u00e8re deformity\\, ulnar deviation\\, and distal hyperextensibility of the thumbs (Fig. 1). Subcutaneous nodules were observed on the proximal interphalangeal joints of the second and third fingers of the right hand and on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger of the left hand. Synovial thickening of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the second fingers was noted. There was mild swelling and tenderness of the wrists. She had pain with flexion of the shoulders and right hip\\, and there was subtle swelling of the shoulders and right knee. Pitting edema (3+) and vitiligo were noted on the legs. No sclerodactyly\\, digital pitting\\, telangiectasias\\, appreciable calcinosis\\, nodules\\, nail changes (including pitting)\\, or tophi were present. The remainder of the examination was normal. FIGURE 1  Photograph of the Hands. The blood levels of glucose\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, bilirubin\\, globulin\\, lactate\\, lipase\\, magnesium\\, and phosphorus were normal\\, as were the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 3+ protein and 3+ blood\\, and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field and granular casts. Urine and blood were obtained for culture.

Frontal and lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine (Figure 1B) showed superior and inferior end-plate depressions at multiple vertebral levels and diffuse bony sclerosis\\, findings consistent with bony changes from sickle cell disease. An anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis (Figure 1C) showed evidence of total hip arthroplasty; the findings had not changed from those observed on recently obtained radiographs. FIGURE 1  Radiographs of the Chest\\, Spine\\, and Pelvis Obtained 7 Days before the Current Admission. Dr. Sallah: A diagnosis of a painful vaso-occlusive event was made\\, and treatment included intravenous fluids\\, ketorolac\\, and hydromorphone. Musculoskeletal strain was considered to be a contributing factor for the pain\\, given the recent strenuous activity. The pain slowly abated\\, and on hospital day 5\\, the patient was discharged home. One day after discharge\\, and 2 days before the current presentation\\, pain in the right hip developed while the patient was at rest. Despite treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen\\, the hip pain worsened\\, and the patient was unable to walk. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department\\, the patient reported pain in the right hip that felt different in quality from the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. He also reported pleuritic chest pain that felt similar in quality to the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. The tympanic temperature measured at home was 37.8\u00b0C. During the 6 months before the current presentation\\, vaso-occlusive events had increased in frequency and severity. There had been three hospital admissions with a duration of 4 to 8 days\\, including one admission for acute chest syndrome. The pain associated with vaso-occlusive events typically involved the chest\\, arms\\, or thighs. There was a history of automated red-cell exchange\\, which had been performed before total hip arthroplasty; there was also a history of four blood transfusions. Other history included tinnitus\\, symmetric high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in both ears\\, and cholelithiasis. Medications included voxelotor and folic acid\\, as well as acetaminophen\\, ibuprofen\\, and hydromorphone as needed for pain. The patient had no known allergies. He lived in a suburb of Boston and worked as an engineer. He had traveled to West Africa 1 year before the current presentation and to South Asia 3 weeks before the current presentation. He drank alcohol occasionally\\, had never smoked tobacco\\, and did not use illicit drugs. Both of his parents and his brother had sickle cell trait. The temporal temperature was 35.7\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 121/56 mm Hg\\, the pulse 67 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. He had mild tenderness on palpation of the right hip but no obvious deformity; there was a well-healed incision without overlying erythema. He was able to fully extend and flex the right hip\\, but such movement caused mild discomfort. There was moderate discomfort with the log-roll test (rolling the thigh internally and externally with the patient in the supine position). The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal\\, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 15\\,680 per microliter (reference range\\, 4500 to 11\\,000)\\, the hemoglobin level 7.5 g per deciliter (reference range\\, 13.5 to 17.5)\\, and the platelet count 581\\,000 per microliter (reference range\\, 150\\,000 to 400\\,000).

A controlled ankle motion walking boot and crutches were recommended for ambulation. Dr. Selen: During the next 3 months\\, the pain in the right foot persisted\\, and new pain developed in the left foot. The patient was seen in the pain medicine and podiatry clinics affiliated with the other hospital. Diagnoses of plantar fasciitis\\, Achilles\u2019 tendinitis\\, and sinus tarsi syndrome were considered. Treatment with methylprednisolone and celecoxib was initiated\\, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation in the rheumatology clinic\\, the patient reported bilateral foot and ankle pain and swelling that was greater in the right foot and ankle than in the left\\, as well as stiffness and warmth in the ankles. There was lower back pain and bilateral hip pain\\, which was greater on the right side than on the left side. The patient reported that the back and hip pain had been present since she was a teenager but had gradually increased in severity during the previous year. Fatigue and generalized weakness had developed and worsened during the previous month. There was no fever\\, weight loss\\, or change in diet. Menarche had occurred when the patient was 11 years of age\\, and menstrual cycles had been regular since then. There was a history of fractures of the left wrist in childhood. Other medical history included obesity\\, hyperlipidemia\\, anxiety\\, nephrolithiasis\\, biliary dyskinesia (which had led to cholecystectomy 1 year before this admission)\\, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosed on the basis of a liver biopsy. Medications included celecoxib\\, ergocalciferol\\, citalopram\\, and lorazepam; she had no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England and had previously worked as a nurse; however\\, she was unable to work during the previous 8 months because of pain and difficulty with ambulation. She did not smoke cigarettes\\, drink alcohol\\, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had osteopenia; her mother\\, father\\, and sister had psoriasis; her father had psoriatic arthritis; and her brother had the Williams syndrome\\, a rare genetic and developmental disorder. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 121/78\\, and the heart rate 94 beats per minute. Dentition was normal\\, and the gait was antalgic. Proximal muscle strength was intact in both arms (5/5) and slightly reduced in the legs (4/5). There was tenderness over the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints that was more pronounced on the right side than on the left side. The FABER test \u2014 in which the leg is flexed and the thigh is abducted and externally rotated \u2014 elicited pain in both hips. There was tenderness over the right midfoot and warmth and swelling of the ankles. No musculoskeletal deformities\\, bowing of the legs\\, lymphadenopathy\\, skin lesions\\, or rashes were noted. The blood level of phosphorus was 1.0 mg per deciliter (0.3 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter]); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was instructed to go to the emergency department of this hospital. Intravenous sodium phosphate and oral potassium phosphate were administered. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Balza: Radiography of the lumbar spine\\, pelvis\\, hips\\, and ankles revealed anterolisthesis of L4 and L5 with a defect in the pars interarticularis; there were no fractures. On radiography of the right foot\\, a fracture in the third metatarsal was initially identified 8 months before admission (Figure 1A)\\, followed by the development of fractures in the fourth and fifth metatarsals 1 month later (Figure 1B). Subsequently\\, T2-weighted MRI of the sacrum with fat suppression performed on admission (Figure 1E and 1F) revealed vertically oriented hypointense bands in the bilateral sacral alae and a horizontally oriented hypointense band in S2\\, as well as bone marrow edema adjacent to the fracture lines; the combination of these findings was consistent with an H-shaped sacral insufficiency fracture.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of oral contrast material\\, reportedly revealed ground-glass opacities in the lungs\\, pulmonary nodules\\, esophageal dilatation\\, and diffuse osteopenia\\, along with ascites\\, hepatic steatosis\\, diffuse bowel-wall thickening\\, dilated loops of small bowel\\, and horseshoe kidney. A heterogeneous mass\\, measuring 11 cm by 8 cm by 7 cm\\, with internal necrosis was identified near the pancreatic tail. Abdominal ultrasonography reportedly showed a cirrhotic-appearing liver and ascites. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was reportedly notable for severe esophagitis but showed no source of acute bleeding. During the first 7 hospital days\\, diarrhea continued\\, with an output of up to 2 liters of green liquid stool daily. Examination of a stool specimen was reportedly positive for leukocytes and negative for Clostridioides difficile and Shiga toxin\\, as well as campylobacter\\, giardia\\, and cryptosporidium antigens. On hospital day 7\\, anuria occurred\\, and the bladder pressure was 23 mm Hg. Paracentesis was performed for the treatment of abdominal distention\\, and 3.7 liters of ascitic fluid was removed. Testing of the ascitic fluid revealed 14\\,000 erythrocytes per microliter and 91 neutrophils per microliter. The albumin level in ascitic fluid was 0.3 g per deciliter; the concurrent serum albumin level was 3.2 g per deciliter. No organisms were detected on Gram\u2019s staining of the ascitic fluid. Norepinephrine and albumin were administered intravenously. The next day\\, there was an output of copious black stool. The hemoglobin level decreased from 8.1 g per deciliter to 5.1 g per deciliter; additional norepinephrine was administered intravenously\\, along with 4 units of packed red cells\\, cryoprecipitate\\, vitamin K\\, and fresh-frozen plasma. Intubation of the trachea was performed for repeat EGD\\, which reportedly revealed a pulsatile vascular lesion in the distal esophagus; blood was detected around the lesion. Octreotide and pantoprazole were administered intravenously\\, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to the ICU of this hospital. Because the patient had undergone intubation\\, the medical history was initially obtained from her husband and was limited. Celiac disease had been diagnosed in her late 30s\\, but she did not follow a gluten-free diet. Her one pregnancy had been complicated by severe gestational hypertension\\, with delivery by cesarean section performed at 33 weeks\u2019 gestation. Menopause had occurred in her mid-40s. Recurrent otitis media had led to tympanic membrane perforation and resultant chronic hearing loss. In the past year\\, she had lost 7 kg of weight unintentionally. In the 2 weeks before she was admitted to the other hospital\\, after the onset of diarrhea\\, she had had a decreased appetite and had eaten only candy and cereal\\, with 2 kg of weight loss. The patient attended college and worked as a technical consultant. She lived with her husband. She had no history of nicotine\\, alcohol\\, or illicit substance use. She took no medications or supplements\\, and there were no known adverse reactions to medications. Her family history included stroke in her father\\, colon cancer in her paternal grandfather\\, and pancreatic cancer in a paternal great-grandfather and a paternal aunt. She had an adult child\\, who was healthy. On examination in the ICU\\, the patient appeared chronically ill. The temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 91 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 102/67 mm Hg\\, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute.

The patient had a history of impulsivity and frequent episodes of self-injury\\, such as head-butting and cutting\\, which sometimes occurred while he was in treatment settings. Twelve months before the current presentation\\, he began to have suicidal ideation\\, with occasional suicidal planning and a suicide attempt. During the next year\\, the patient had 10 evaluations in the emergency department and six inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations. One day before the current presentation\\, the patient was discharged from an inpatient psychiatric hospital\\, where he had been admitted and treated for 3 weeks because of urges to hurt himself. On the day of the current presentation\\, the patient visited his middle school and participated in therapy at home. Throughout the day\\, he noticed worsening depression and had recurrent thoughts of self-injury and suicide. He asked his parents to call emergency medical services because he felt unsafe in his home. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival\\, the patient was in an agitated and combative state\\, reporting that he had changed his mind and no longer wanted to be in the hospital. Attempts at verbal deescalation were not effective. Treatment with intramuscular olanzapine was administered\\, and physical restraints were placed on his arms and legs. During the next 6 hours\\, the agitation decreased\\, and the physical restraints were removed. Additional history was obtained but was limited because the patient shrugged his shoulders in response to most questions. He described the school visit as difficult and uncomfortable. He did not indicate why he felt unsafe in his home; he reported that he had picked at scabs on his arms and legs in order to hurt himself and had ongoing suicidal ideation. The patient also reported difficulty sleeping and concentrating\\, as well as loss of interest and motivation\\, although he still enjoyed playing sports. He had no homicidal ideation\\, paranoid thoughts\\, or delusions. Medications included extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not smoke cigarettes\\, drink alcohol\\, or use illicit drugs. He lived in an urban area of New Hampshire with his mother\\, father\\, and sister. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 133/78 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 76 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared disheveled. There were scattered cuts and wounds in varying stages of healing on both arms. The patient was in a disengaged and agitated state. He had a depressed mood\\, a guarded affect\\, and difficulty concentrating. His speech was slow and soft\\, with reduced prosody. His thought process was logical and linear; the thought content was notable for suicidal ideation. He had no loosening of associations\\, delusions\\, or hallucinations. Insight and judgment were poor. The patient was deemed to be at high risk for harm and was transferred to the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department. Transfer to an inpatient psychiatric hospital was requested\\, but no beds were available at any facility in the region. During the next 6 weeks\\, while the patient was awaiting admission to an inpatient psychiatric hospital\\, treatment with extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone was continued\\, and treatment with sertraline\\, diphenhydramine\\, and melatonin was initiated. He had frequent episodes of agitation\\, which led to the administration of oral clonidine or oral or intramuscular olanzapine as needed. He also had several episodes of self-injury; surveillance was heightened\\, with well-being checks performed every 15 minutes. On day 41 in the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department\\, agitation developed\\, and a dose of oral olanzapine was administered in addition to scheduled medications. One hour later\\, agitation continued\\, and a dose of intramuscular olanzapine was administered. After the administration of intramuscular olanzapine\\, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 119/65 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 73 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The next morning\\, the blood pressure was 146/87 mm Hg and the heart rate 52 beats per minute. There were no new symptoms; the examination was unchanged. Twelve hours later\\, the blood pressure was 69/39 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. The patient reported malaise and lightheadedness with standing\\, as well as nausea and abdominal pain. He appeared pale\\, tired\\, and lethargic. Oral rehydration was encouraged. One hour later\\, the blood pressure was 94/50 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. Three hours after the onset of hypotension\\, the blood pressure was 79/45 mm Hg and the heart rate 85 beats per minute. Blood and urine toxicologic screening was negative.

Vaginal metronidazole gel was prescribed. Two days later\\, the urine culture grew more than 100\\,000 colony-forming units (CFU) of Escherichia coli per milliliter and 10\\,000 to 100\\,000 CFU of Klebsiella pneumoniae per milliliter. A 14-day course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was prescribed. The inguinal swelling reportedly abated\\, but the flank pain and nausea persisted. Two days after the patient completed the prescribed course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole\\, fever and night sweats developed. After 3 days of fever with a temperature of up to 38.5\u00b0C\\, she began vomiting and subsequently presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department\\, the patient reported ongoing flank pain\\, malaise\\, nausea\\, and poor appetite with weight loss of 2.3 kg during the past month. There was no sore throat\\, cough\\, or diarrhea. She had a history of hypothyroidism\\, asthma\\, bipolar disorder\\, dysmenorrhea\\, and migraines. She had had multiple urinary tract infections; pyelonephritis had been diagnosed 4 years before this presentation. A copper intrauterine device had been inserted 6 months before this presentation. Medications included albuterol\\, budesonide\u2013formoterol\\, divalproex\\, levothyroxine\\, loratadine\\, and sumatriptan as needed for migraines. The patient did not smoke tobacco\\, drink alcohol\\, or use illicit drugs. She had immigrated to the United States from Brazil 1 year earlier; she had been living in New England during the past year and had been working in a laboratory. She had recently spent 3 months in Brazil visiting her husband and had returned to New England shortly before she noted inguinal swelling. While in Brazil\\, she had remained in a large city and had not visited any remote locations. In New England\\, she lived alone with one kitten and one full-grown cat. There was no family history of cancer. An aunt had died from tuberculosis\\, but the patient had had only minimal contact with her aunt. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 100/63 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 77 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 67.5 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.4. The patient appeared ill. The right side of the abdomen was tender on palpation\\, without rebound or guarding. Hepatosplenomegaly was not present. Tender bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were noted. No palpable cervical\\, supraclavicular\\, infraclavicular\\, or axillary lymphadenopathy was noted. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Blood levels of glucose\\, electrolytes\\, creatine kinase\\, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal\\, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative\\, as was an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. TABLE 1  Laboratory Data.

    "ground_truth_output": "nausea\\, and the inability to eat solid and liquid food. The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The symptoms had been well controlled with the use of daily omeprazole therapy until 11 months before this admission\\, when heartburn recurred despite treatment. At that time\\, the patient also noticed nausea after eating and early satiation. During the next 9 months\\, the heartburn and nausea slowly increased in severity. To help manage his symptoms\\, the patient adjusted his diet from solid food to soft solid food. Two months before this admission\\, the patient sought evaluation at the gastroenterology clinic of another hospital. The glycated hemoglobin level was 6.1% (reference range\\, 4.3 to 5.6). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. Although the patient had not eaten food for 24 hours before the procedure\\, the stomach could not be adequately visualized because there was a large amount of residual food; no intraluminal masses were seen. A scintigraphy study of gastric emptying was performed. During the study\\, 88% of the gastric contents were retained at 1 hour\\, 88% at 2 hours\\, 81% at 3 hours\\, and 80% at 4 hours. In a patient with normal gastric emptying\\, less than 60% of the gastric contents would be retained at 2 hours and less than 10% at 4 hours. Thus\\, the results were consistent with severely delayed gastric emptying. The patient was told that he had idiopathic gastroparesis and underwent trials of several medications. Ondansetron caused constipation\\, erythromycin caused burning while swallowing and abdominal cramping\\, and metoclopramide and scopolamine did not lead to a decrease in the patient\u2019s symptoms. During the 2 months after the evaluation in the gastroenterology clinic\\, the patient adjusted his diet from soft solid food to blended solid food. Two weeks before this admission\\, he adjusted his diet to primarily liquid food\\, such as nutritional supplement drinks\\, protein shakes\\, and ice cream. When the patient was no longer able to drink liquids\\, he sought evaluation at the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation\\, the patient described epigastric burning and nausea after eating. He had lost 13.6 kg of weight in the preceding year\\, including 5.4 kg in the past 2 weeks. He had no recent history of illness\\, night sweats\\, vomiting\\, dysphagia\\, odynophagia\\, abdominal pain\\, or diarrhea. Dr. David A. Rosman: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a patulous esophagus\\, along with wall thickening in scattered areas of the upper and lower segments of the esophagus. There was abnormal circumferential wall thickening (\u226413 mm) in the stomach\\, particularly at the antrum\\, incisura\\, and pyloric canal (Figure 1). The antrum was decompressed or nonexpansile\\, and the rest of the stomach was distended. There were multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules (\u22645 mm in diameter) and multiple hepatic hypodensities (<10 mm in diameter)\\, as well as a pancreatic cyst (5 mm in diameter) and an exophytic renal lesion (8 mm in diameter). FIGURE 1  CT Scan of the Abdomen. Dr. Badran: A nasogastric tube was inserted. Treatment with intravenous pantoprazole was started\\, and intravenous lorazepam was administered for nausea. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. During the subsequent week\\, the patient received vitamin and mineral supplements for severe malnutrition. He remained unable to drink liquids. On the 7th hospital day\\, a peripherally inserted central catheter was placed\\, and total parenteral nutrition was administered. The patient was monitored for refeeding syndrome. On the 15th hospital day\\, he was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. On transfer to this hospital\\, additional history was obtained. The patient had a history of prediabetes\\, hypertension\\, dyslipidemia\\, diverticulosis\\, glaucoma\\, and basal cell carcinoma of the ear that had been resected. Five years before this admission\\, EGD had revealed a widely patent Schatzki\u2019s ring\\, an irregular-appearing Z line\\, and a few gastric polyps; examination of an esophageal biopsy specimen had revealed no abnormalities. Colonoscopy had shown two tubular adenomas. The patient had undergone orthognathic surgery\\, but there was no history of abdominal surgery. Medications included omeprazole\\, lisinopril\\, atorvastatin\\, vitamin D supplements\\, and bimatoprost and bromonidine eye drops. Sulfa drugs had caused a rash. The patient lived with his wife in a rural area of New England. He had previously served in the military and currently worked as a biotechnologist. He had never smoked tobacco\\, and he drank alcohol rarely. His mother and paternal aunt had died of colon cancer\\, his father of lung cancer\\, his maternal grandmother of breast cancer\\, and his maternal grandfather of prostate cancer. His two children and two grandchildren were healthy. On examination\\, the temperature was 37.7\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg\\, the pulse 105 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was thin and had a nasogastric tube in place. He had normal mood\\, affect\\, and insight. The abdomen was flat\\, soft\\, and nondistended\\, with mild tenderness in the epigastrium on palpation. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Distal sensory and motor function were normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1  Laboratory Data.

Two days after discharge from the other hospital\\, and 4 days before the current presentation\\, an erosive rash developed on the skin of the groin\\, with associated pruritus and pain in the affected area of the skin. The patient had no fever or chills. Over the course of the next 3 days\\, the rash progressed to the perineum and lower abdomen. One day before the current presentation\\, the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of the other hospital. Skin breakdown and purulent drainage were reportedly present on the skin of the perineum\\, lower abdomen\\, and inframammary folds; the rash was estimated to involve 7% of the total body-surface area. Laboratory evaluation showed leukocytosis\\, lymphocytosis\\, and eosinophilia. CT of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, reportedly showed a focus of inflammation and soft-tissue thickening\\, measuring 2.4 cm in diameter\\, in the left perianal area. The left pelvic sidewall\\, right external iliac\\, and right and left inguinal lymph nodes were enlarged\\, measuring up to 2.1 cm in diameter; the spleen was normal in size. A diagnosis of the Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome was considered\\, treatment with intravenous fluids and glucocorticoids was started\\, and the patient was transferred to this hospital for further care. On arrival at this hospital\\, the patient reported that the skin was no longer pruritic or painful. No eye pain\\, dysuria\\, or vaginal pain was present. She had a history of eczema and psoriasis\\, which had been diagnosed 3 years before the current presentation. Treatment with acitretin and topical betamethasone\\, clobetasol\\, and triamcinolone had been started for psoriasis\\, and had shown some benefit. Her eczema had been treated with dupilumab but was stopped after 6 months owing to ophthalmic complications. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus\\, hypertension\\, dyslipidemia\\, anxiety\\, and genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The last flare of genital HSV had occurred 3 years before the current presentation and had been treated with valacyclovir. Other medications included amlodipine\\, doxepin\\, gabapentin\\, insulin glargine\\, insulin lispro\\, metoprolol\\, and risperidone; lorazepam was used as needed for anxiety. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was retired and had previously worked as a nursing assistant. She was Black and lived with her sister in a suburb of Boston; she had not traveled outside the United States. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Both parents had diabetes; there was no family history of recurrent infections. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 131/71 mm Hg\\, the pulse 99 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 17.2. There were multiple punched-out\\, monomorphic ulcers coalescing into ulcerative plaques on the skin of the axillae\\, inframammary folds\\, neck\\, lower abdomen\\, pubic area\\, and both medial thighs with associated purulent drainage and malodor (Figure 1). Onychodystrophy was present on the fingernails and toenails. The palmar and dorsal aspects of both hands had scaling\\, deep fissuring\\, and serous crusting. Subtle blanching erythema covered more than 90% of the body-surface area; she had not noticed this change\\, and she did not know the timing of onset. No oral or mucosal lesions were present. There was nontender axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was normal. FIGURE 1  Clinical Photographs of the Skin Obtained on Presentation to This Hospital. The blood levels of electrolytes\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, and alkaline phosphatase were normal\\, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The plasma level of lactate was 2.7 mmol per liter (24.3 mg per deciliter; reference range\\, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18.0 mg per deciliter]) and the blood level of C-reactive protein 130.9 mg per liter (reference value\\, <8.0). The complete blood count with differential count was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A sample of epidermal cells that was obtained from the base of an unroofed lesion was sent for HSV nucleic acid testing. Punch biopsies of the skin of the left axilla and the left upper arm were performed. A clinical diagnosis of Kaposi\u2019s varicelliform eruption (KVE) with superinfection was considered\\, and treatment with intravenous acyclovir\\, ceftriaxone\\, and vancomycin was started. The patient was admitted to this hospital. On the second hospital day\\, the white-cell count had increased to 17\\,270 per microliter (reference range\\, 4500 to 11\\,000)\\, and the absolute eosinophil count had increased to 6820 per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 900). The blood level of troponin was 7 ng per liter (reference range\\, 0 to 9)\\, the cobalamin level 345 pg per milliliter (255 pmol per liter; reference value\\, >231 pg per milliliter [>170 pmol per liter])\\, the tryptase level 4.5 ng per milliliter (reference value\\, <11.5)\\, and the IgE level 25\\,113 IU per milliliter (reference range\\, 0 to 100). Serum protein electrophoresis showed a normal pattern with a moderate diffuse decrease in the globulin level. Antibodies to antinuclear antigens were detected at a dilution of 1:40. Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Preliminary examination of the two skin-biopsy specimens revealed changes consistent with HSV infection in the left axilla and a psoriasiform dermatitis in the left upper arm; there was no evidence of cutaneous involvement caused by a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Cultures that were obtained from one of the groin wounds grew moderate amounts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment with ceftriaxone was stopped\\, and treatment with intravenous cefepime was started. Dr. Rory L. Cochran: CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a multilobulated mass in the superior segment of the left lower lobe that extended beyond the left major fissure (Figure 2A)\\, along with multiple additional bilateral pulmonary nodules of varying size (Figure 2B); there was marked bilateral axillary and subpectoral lymphadenopathy (Figure 2C). Abdominal and pelvic images were remarkable for mild superficial soft-tissue thickening along the intergluteal cleft immediately posterior to the anal verge (Figure 2D and 2E)\\, as well as bilateral external iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy (Figure 2F).

Examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed normocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. No evidence of a myeloproliferative neoplasm or a V617F mutation in the gene encoding Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) was detected. Five years later (2 years before the current presentation)\\, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician because of polycythemia and flank pain on the left side. A faint IgG kappa monoclonal band was reportedly seen on immunoelectrophoresis. The blood levels of IgG\\, IgA\\, IgM\\, erythropoietin\\, and lactate dehydrogenase were reportedly normal. Dr. Ambrose J. Huang: Ultrasonography performed at the first hospital reportedly revealed a complicated cyst\\, measuring 24 mm in diameter\\, in the upper pole of the left kidney with mural thickening and internal echoes. The patient also had an 18-mm parapelvic cyst in the middle portion of the left kidney\\, a 4-mm nonobstructive calculus in the left kidney\\, and mild parenchymal scarring in the right kidney. Seven weeks later\\, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of gadolinium\\, allowed for further characterization of the lesions. The lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney reportedly had homogeneous enhancement and was suggestive of renal-cell carcinoma. Approximately 17 months before the current presentation\\, the patient was evaluated at the urology clinic of a second hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of contrast material\\, reportedly showed the enhancing 24-mm mass in the upper pole of the left kidney that was suggestive of renal-cell carcinoma. There was no evidence of metastatic disease. The 18-mm mass in the middle of the left kidney appeared as poorly circumscribed and hypoattenuating. Dr. Stone: Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy was performed to remove the mass in the upper pole of the left kidney. Histopathological examination of the tissue specimen revealed mild focal global glomerulosclerosis\\, mild interstitial fibrosis\\, and mild arteriosclerosis. No tumor was seen. Dr. Huang: Four months later\\, follow-up MRI of the abdomen and pelvis performed at the first hospital showed no recurrence of a mass in the surgical bed. Three months thereafter\\, ultrasonography performed at the first hospital reportedly revealed a new 19-mm hypoechoic lesion in the lower pole of the right kidney and showed a stable 18-mm mass in the middle of the left kidney. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI performed 1 month later showed that the 19-mm lesion in the lower pole of the right kidney was exophytic and enhancing (Figure 1A). The appearance of this lesion on imaging was reportedly similar to the appearance of the 24-mm lesion that had been resected from the left kidney. FIGURE 1  Initial imaging Studies. Dr. Stone: Approximately 7 months before the current presentation\\, the patient had a consultation with a urologist at a third hospital. A percutaneous CT-guided biopsy targeting the exophytic lesion in the lower pole of the right kidney was performed (Figure 1B). On histopathological examination\\, there was no renal parenchyma; it was assumed that only retroperitoneal tissue near the kidney had been obtained. The biopsy specimen showed atypical fibrous tissue with a storiform pattern of fibrosis and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. Polytypic kappa and lambda staining within plasma cells was noted. There were more than 10 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-power field\\, but these cells made up less than 40% of the overall IgG+ cells. Flow cytometry was performed on the tissue specimen obtained during the attempted renal biopsy and showed no monotypic B-cell population.

Gadolinium-enhanced MRI performed 1 month later showed multiple enhancing marrow-replacing lesions in the left humerus (Figure 1E and 1F)\\, the left ilium\\, and both acetabula (Figure 2A and 2B). These findings were suggestive of multiple myeloma\\, metastases\\, or an infiltrative process. The lesions in the right kidney had not changed since the previous MRI. FIGURE 2  Additional Imaging Studies. Dr. Stone: Three months later\\, the patient was evaluated at the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. On review of systems\\, she reported fatigue\\, as well as pain in the left shoulder and arm that had lasted for several months. She reported no weight change\\, fever\\, chills\\, or cardiac\\, respiratory\\, gastrointestinal\\, or genitourinary symptoms. Her medical history was notable for early menopause\\, which had occurred at 40 years of age and had been attributed to primary ovarian failure\\, as well as celiac disease\\, hyperlipidemia\\, hypertension\\, hiatal hernia\\, kidney stones\\, and migraines. Medications included atorvastatin\\, spironolactone\\, topiramate\\, and a multivitamin. She reported having adverse reactions to meperidine\\, methylprednisolone\\, and nickel. The patient was self-employed and lived in a small town with her husband. She had one adult child. She had smoked one third of a pack of cigarettes per day for 10 years but had quit smoking more than 15 years before this evaluation. She had no history of alcohol or other substance use. Her mother had died in her 50s from renal-cell carcinoma. A maternal aunt had ovarian and uterine cancer\\, and another had ovarian cancer. The patient\u2019s BRCA mutation status was negative. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 63 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 134/61 mm Hg\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 90 kg\\, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 30.1. She had no proptosis\\, enlargement of the lacrimal glands\\, or enlargement of the major salivary glands (submandibular or parotid). No lymphadenopathy was present. The cardiac\\, lung\\, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. The musculoskeletal examination revealed tenderness and markedly limited abduction at the left shoulder but was otherwise unremarkable. The white-cell count\\, differential count\\, and blood levels of electrolytes\\, calcium\\, and albumin were normal\\, as were test results for liver and kidney function; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Huang: A radiograph of the left shoulder showed a lytic lesion in the greater tuberosity that corresponded to lesions that had been identified on PET-CT and MRI (Figure 2C). Three months later\\, repeat whole-body PET-CT performed at the first hospital reportedly showed FDG uptake in both humeri and both acetabula. No hypermetabolic lymph nodes or lytic bone lesions were reportedly present on CT. Dr. Stone: A CT-guided bone biopsy of the left humerus performed at the first hospital reportedly showed fragments of trabecular bone. The bone marrow contained a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with many plasma cells and fibrosis. Immunostaining showed a high background level of kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains\\, without a clonal population\\, as well as scattered IgG4+ cells. Five months after the initial presentation\\, the patient returned to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody was negative\\, as was an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Two doses of rituximab were prescribed\\, but the patient had an infusion reaction while the second dose was being administered and was unable to complete the course. Dr. Huang: Four months later\\, whole-body MRI performed at the first hospital reportedly showed multiple 2-to-3-cm lesions in the humeri and acetabula that had not changed substantially from previous imaging studies. Additional 3-cm lesions were noted in the distal femurs\\, proximal tibias\\, and proximal fibulas (Figure 2D and 2E); these findings had not been seen previously. Dr. Stone: Histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen and aspirate of a left tibial lesion was performed at the first hospital. Polytypic light-chain expression was noted\\, with more than 30 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-power field and an IgG4:IgG ratio of greater than 40%. Diagnostic tests were performed\\, and management decisions were made.,Rosai\u2013Dorfman\u2013Destombes disease."

    "ground_truth_output": "para 1) with a history of hepatitis C virus infection. Pregnancy was complicated by urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection that was treated in the second trimester\\, as well as gestational hypertension. Serial ultrasound surveys of the fetal anatomy performed between 20 weeks 1 day of gestation and 39 weeks 6 days of gestation revealed dilatation of the urinary tract on the right side. Ultrasonography of the fetal heart was normal. At 40 weeks 0 days of gestation\\, spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred\\, and the newborn\u2019s mother was admitted to this hospital. Fetal heart tracings indicated nonreassuring fetal status\\, and at 22 hours 39 minutes of labor\\, a cesarean section was performed. The uterus was incised\\, and the amniotic fluid was noted to be stained with meconium. Six minutes later\\, the newborn was delivered; she was in a breech position at delivery. The birth weight was 3575 g (62nd percentile)\\, the length 50 cm (42nd percentile)\\, and the head circumference 35.5 cm (72nd percentile). The newborn had limp tone and no respiratory effort. Ventilatory support was initiated\\, and the trachea was intubated. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed. Doses of epinephrine were administered through the endotracheal tube and an umbilical venous catheter\\, as were boluses of normal saline. After 16 minutes\\, spontaneous circulation was restored. The Apgar scores at 1\\, 5\\, 10\\, 15\\, and 20 minutes were 1\\, 0\\, 0\\, 1\\, and 3\\, respectively. The newborn was admitted to the NICU. On the patient\u2019s arrival in the NICU\\, the axillary temperature was 34.9\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 141 beats per minute\\, and the blood pressure 84/59 mm Hg. The oxygen saturation was 97% while she was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in pressure-control mode. A course of therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. Dr. Evan J. Zucker: Chest radiography (Figure 1A) revealed a small-to-moderate pneumothorax in the medial aspect of the pleural cavity on the right side. Subtle lucency in the middle-to-lower thorax was present on the left side\\, a finding attributed to a possible left pneumothorax or air trapping. FIGURE 1  Chest Radiographs. Dr. Okuducu: Needle thoracentesis was performed on the right side\\, and 20 ml of air was removed. Empirical treatment with ampicillin and ceftazidime was started. On day 2\\, increased work of breathing developed\\, and additional imaging was performed. Dr. Zucker: Repeat chest radiography (Figure 1B) showed resolution of the right pneumothorax and development of a large left pneumothorax with extensive collapse of the left lung. Needle thoracentesis was performed on the left side\\, and 27 ml of air was removed. Chest radiography performed after thoracentesis (Figure 1C) showed that the left pneumothorax had decreased in size and inflation of the left lung had increased. Dr. Angela R. Shih: Pathological examination of the placenta revealed meconium-stained membranes. There was evidence of acute chorioamnionitis with fetal vascular involvement and bacterial organisms on and in the membranes. Dr. Okuducu: During the next 2 days\\, the difference between the preductal oxygen saturation and the postductal oxygen saturation ranged from 5 to 15 percentage points\\, a finding suggestive of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. The fraction of inspired oxygen on the mechanical ventilator was increased to 1.0\\, and the administration of inhaled nitric oxide was initiated. Hypotension was treated with fluid resuscitation\\, and dopamine and milrinone infusions were started. Empirical treatment with vancomycin was also started. On transthoracic echocardiography\\, biventricular systolic function was at the low end of the normal range\\, and the right ventricle was moderately enlarged. A patent ductus arteriosus (measuring 2.9 mm in diameter)\\, a midmuscular ventricular septal defect (measuring 2.0 mm in diameter)\\, and a patent foramen ovale (measuring 2.5 mm in diameter) were present; each of these features was associated with bidirectional shunting. Tricuspid regurgitation (peak gradient\\, 58 mm Hg; arterial blood pressure\\, 66/36 mm Hg) and ventricular septal flattening were present\\, findings suggestive of elevated right ventricular pressure due to pulmonary hypertension. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder revealed severe dilatation of the urinary tract on the right side; the left kidney was normal. The patient had an episode of rhythmic myoclonic jerking of the left leg that progressed to shaking of the left leg and arm\\, and phenobarbital was administered. Electroencephalography confirmed that a seizure originating in the midline posterior region had occurred. The seizure had lasted 25 minutes and had resolved spontaneously before the administration of phenobarbital. Ultrasonography of the head was normal. On day 4\\, the patient completed the 72-hour course of therapeutic hypothermia\\, and rewarming began. The blood pressure decreased. The milrinone infusion was gradually discontinued\\, the dopamine infusion dose was increased\\, an epinephrine infusion was started\\, and hydrocortisone was administered. The newborn had episodes of agitation that were associated with labile oxygen saturation. Chest radiography showed that the left pneumothorax had continued to decrease in size; patchy opacities were seen throughout the right lung. Transthoracic echocardiography showed depressed right ventricular function. During the next week\\, the pressor dose was increased. The periods of decreased oxygen saturation became more frequent and more prolonged\\, and ventilatory support was increased. On day 11\\, the oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in pressure-control mode (peak inspiratory pressure\\, 31 cm of water; positive end-expiratory pressure\\, 9 cm of water; fraction of inspired oxygen\\, 1.0)\\, along with inhaled nitric oxide. Empirical therapy with vancomycin\\, ampicillin\\, and ceftazidime was stopped after the patient completed 10-day courses. On day 16\\, the axillary temperature increased to 38.8\u00b0C. Chest radiography showed an opacity in the left lower lobe and a small left pleural effusion\\, as well as linear opacities in both upper lobes. Empirical treatment with oxacillin and gentamicin was started. On day 19\\, ventilatory support remained elevated\\, and empirical antibiotic therapy was transitioned to vancomycin and cefepime. Dr. Zucker: On day 21\\, repeat chest radiography (Figure 1D) showed a persistent opacity in the left lower lobe. Empirical therapy with vancomycin was discontinued. Dr. Okuducu: A diagnostic test was performed.,Intralobar bronchopulmonary sequestration."

After a 1-week admission\\, the dyspnea abated\\, and the patient was discharged with instructions to complete a 2-week course of antibiotic therapy. Two weeks before this evaluation\\, generalized weakness and lethargy developed\\, along with new diffuse headache. The patient\u2019s family thought that she appeared somnolent and \u201cclumsy\u201d while walking. Four days later\\, her family took her to the other hospital for evaluation. A review of systems was notable for dyspnea\\, leg edema\\, and hematochezia and no fever\\, chills\\, chest pain\\, cough\\, dysuria\\, hematuria\\, or melena. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 74 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 176/101 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented but appeared to be confused when recalling recent events. She had jugular venous distention\\, diffuse lung rales\\, and 2+ symmetric pitting edema of the lower legs up to the knees. The blood urea nitrogen level was 83 mg per deciliter (29.6 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 6 to 20 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 7.1 mmol per liter])\\, the creatinine level 4.9 mg per deciliter (433 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range\\, 0.4 to 1.1 mg per deciliter [35 to 97 \u03bcmol per liter])\\, and the hematocrit 26% (reference range\\, 34 to 45).

Gilberto Gonzalez: Chest radiography revealed a small right pleural effusion and moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. Computed tomography (CT) of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a chronic subcortical infarct of the right frontal lobe\\, as well as diffuse involutional changes and nonspecific white-matter hypodensities. Dr. Merali: Oral labetalol\\, clonidine\\, and hydralazine and intravenous furosemide were administered to treat possible hypertensive emergency. During the next 2 days\\, the patient\u2019s headache and anemia worsened and dizziness developed. On the seventh hospital day\\, there was an acute episode of nonbloody emesis\\, followed by a generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure lasting 1 minute. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital. Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat CT of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed findings similar to those of the previous study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1)\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed two foci of restricted diffusion in the right frontal lobe and the left cerebellar hemisphere\\, each measuring 1 cm in diameter\\, with surrounding signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. In addition\\, there was diffuse ventricular enlargement\\, with surrounding smooth hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR images; this finding is suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). T2-weighted and FLAIR images also showed multiple foci of hyperintensity scattered throughout the deep white matter. FIGURE 1  MRI of the Head. Dr. Merali: Video electroencephalography revealed epileptiform discharges predominantly in the frontal lobe\\, with generalized slowing. Levetiracetam\\, vancomycin\\, and ceftazidime were administered; intermittent hemodialysis was initiated. During the next 3 days\\, the patient began to have a right gaze preference\\, left hemineglect\\, and aphasia. The temperature increased to 39.4\u00b0C\\, and chills developed. Blood specimens were obtained for microbiologic culture. Lumbar puncture was deferred\\, pending additional imaging studies to rule out a space-occupying lesion. Empirical treatment with vancomycin\\, ceftazidime\\, ampicillin\\, metronidazole\\, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. At the request of her family\\, the patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital. On arrival at this hospital\\, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family. Two years earlier\\, the patient had received a diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma\\, which was treated with fluorouracil\\, leucovorin\\, and oxaliplatin. Therapy was discontinued after three of six cycles because of ileus\\, renal injury\\, and neutropenic fever. Robotic subtotal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were then performed; histologic examination of the resected tissue revealed a nearly complete response of the adenocarcinoma. Five months before the current evaluation\\, CT with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography performed at the other hospital revealed FDG avidity in nonenlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum\\, retroperitoneum\\, porta hepatis\\, and right cervical region. Biopsy was offered\\, but the patient chose to undergo active surveillance. Additional medical history included hypertension\\, hyperlipidemia\\, type 2 diabetes mellitus\\, hypothyroidism\\, and stage 5 chronic kidney disease. Medications included torsemide\\, amlodipine\\, clonidine\\, hydralazine\\, hydrochlorothiazide\\, labetalol\\, rosuvastatin\\, insulin\\, levothyroxine\\, cholecalciferol\\, mirtazapine\\, and oxycodone. There were no known drug allergies. Four decades before the current admission\\, the patient had immigrated to the United States from an island off the west coast of Africa. She was widowed\\, had four children\\, and lived with a pet parrot in an urban area of New England. Two months before hospitalization\\, she had been independent in activities of daily living and had received minimal assistance\\, such as with buying groceries\\, from family members. The patient had traveled to her country of origin 8 years earlier and to South America and the Caribbean in the past year. She had had no sexual partners in the past three decades. She did not drink alcohol\\, smoke tobacco\\, or use illicit drugs. Her sister had received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at 60 years of age; there was no family history of rheumatologic\\, neurologic\\, cardiovascular\\, or renal disease. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 93 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 170/92 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.8. The patient was somnolent and variably oriented to self but not to situation\\, location\\, or time. She intermittently opened her eyes spontaneously but did not follow commands or reliably withdraw in response to noxious stimuli. Her face and pupils appeared symmetric; a right gaze preference and left hemineglect were present. There was no evidence of jugular venous distention\\, rales\\, or edema\\, and the abdominal examination was normal. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2 antibodies and p24 antigen was nonreactive. A test for antitreponemal antibodies was positive\\, and a rapid plasma reagin test was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat CT of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed foci of hypoattenuation in the left superior cerebellar hemisphere and the right frontal lobe that corresponded to the foci of restricted diffusion on MRI observed at the other hospital. Dr. Merali: Empirical treatment with vancomycin\\, ceftriaxone\\, ampicillin\\, metronidazole\\, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. On the second hospital day\\, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 15 cm of water. The CSF was slightly yellow\\, with a glucose level of 18 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a protein level of 173 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 5 to 55). There were 236 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 5)\\, of which 69% were neutrophils\\, 19% lymphocytes\\, and 12% monocytes. Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF showed abundant neutrophils and mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed mild left ventricular hypokinesis and aortic sclerosis. On the fourth hospital day\\, new right esophoria developed and the patient was less responsive. The trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation was initiated for airway protection. Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 2)\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed enlargement of the previously observed lesions in the right frontal lobe and left cerebellum. There were additional foci of reduced diffusivity\\, with corresponding hyperintense signal abnormalities on T2-weighted and FLAIR images\\, involving both cerebral hemispheres\\, deep gray matter\\, the brain stem\\, and the cerebellum. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed multifocal narrowing of branches of the bilateral middle and posterior cerebral arteries. CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and no other abnormalities. FIGURE 2  Additional MRI of the Head. Dr. Merali: Empirical treatment with methylprednisolone was started. The next day\\, repeat lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 16 cm of water. The CSF was slightly yellow\\, with a glucose level of 179 mg per deciliter (9.9 mmol per liter) and a protein level of 181 mg per deciliter. There were 286 nucleated cells per microliter\\, of which 83% were neutrophils\\, 9% lymphocytes\\, and 8% monocytes. Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF showed abundant neutrophils and moderate mononuclear cells; there were no organisms. A diagnostic test was performed.,Mycobacterium tuberculosis meningitis."

    "ground_truth_output": "Massachusetts Eye and Ear): A 61-year-old man was evaluated in an ophthalmology clinic affiliated with this hospital because of eyelid swelling. Eight years before the current presentation\\, the patient noticed mild puffiness of the eyelids that was worst in the morning and typically resolved by midday. Five years before the current presentation\\, the eyelid swelling began to progressively worsen and to last throughout the day. The patient had a history of glaucoma; when the eyelid swelling began to interfere with his vision\\, he asked for a consultation with the ophthalmologist who had treated his glaucoma. A diagnosis of dermatochalasis with fat prolapse was suspected\\, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery clinic affiliated with this hospital for consideration of blepharoplasty. In the clinic\\, the patient reported that eyelid puffiness was interfering with his ability to read and drive. He did not have dry eye. He had a sensation of pressure behind the eyes and intermittent double vision. There was generalized joint stiffness in the mornings that resolved after 1 hour. There was left lateral hip pain that radiated to the left buttock and thigh\\, with associated paresthesia in the left foot. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection had been diagnosed 31 years before the current presentation and was well controlled with antiretroviral therapy\\, although lipodystrophy had occurred with treatment. Other medical history included carpal tunnel syndrome\\, cataracts\\, depression\\, dyslipidemia\\, hypertension\\, allergic rhinitis\\, obstructive sleep apnea\\, and asthma\\, in addition to primary open-angle glaucoma. Surgical history included carpal tunnel release surgery (performed 2 months before the current presentation)\\, intraocular lens replacement in both eyes\\, and lipectomy for the reduction of dorsocervical lipohypertrophy due to lipodystrophy. Medications included antiretroviral therapy (elvitegravir\\, cobicistat\\, emtricitabine\\, and tenofovir alafenamide)\\, bupropion\\, fluoxetine\\, triamterene\\, amlodipine\\, atorvastatin\\, inhaled albuterol\\, and topical testosterone. The administration of iodinated contrast material had caused hives. The patient lived part time in Florida and part time in New England. He was a lifelong nonsmoker\\, drank alcohol occasionally\\, and did not use illicit substances. On examination\\, the corrected visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light. Confrontation testing revealed deficits in the outer superior temporal visual fields and the superior nasal visual fields\\, which abated with manual elevation of the eyelids. Supraduction and abduction were limited in both eyes. Soft edema of the upper and lower eyelids was present\\, along with mild erythema of the upper eyelids (Figure 1). The upper-eyelid skin was overhanging the lashes medially\\, a finding indicative of dermatochalasis. There was upper-eyelid ptosis. The globes were moderately resistant to retropulsion\\, and there was mild proptosis. The levator palpebrae superioris muscles had impaired function\\, with an eyelid elevation of 8 mm in the right eye and 11 mm in the left eye (reference range\\, 12 to 18). Slit-lamp examination revealed 1+ chemosis and trace injection in the conjunctivae; there was no evidence of superficial punctate keratopathy or cells in the anterior chambers. Funduscopic examination revealed an increased cup-to-disk ratio in the optic nerves\\, a finding consistent with the patient\u2019s known history of glaucoma. The tongue was enlarged\\, and there was dorsocervical lipohypertrophy on the posterior aspect of the neck. FIGURE 1  Clinical Photographs at Presentation. The blood levels of thyrotropin\\, free thyroxine\\, triiodothyronine\\, thyroid peroxidase antibodies\\, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins were normal. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Laura V. Romo: Computed tomography (CT) of the face and orbits (Figure 2A and 2B)\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed bilateral enlargement of the extraocular muscles and fat stranding in the orbits and elsewhere in the face. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the face and orbits (Figure 2C through 2F)\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed orbital fat stranding and mild\\, symmetric\\, diffuse extraocular-muscle enlargement. A short-tau inversion recovery sequence showed an increased signal that spared the myotendinous junctions. Diffuse thickening and stranding of the skin on the preseptal eyelids and face\\, episcleritis along the posterior margin of both globes\\, and perineuritis around the optic nerves were also noted. FIGURE 2  Imaging Studies of the Face and Orbits. Dr. Lu: The blood levels of glucose and electrolytes and the results of kidney-function tests were normal\\, as were the blood levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)\\, lysozyme\\, rheumatoid factor\\, and C-reactive protein. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 22 mm per hour (reference range\\, 0 to 20). The blood IgG level was 1980 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 767 to 1590)\\, the IgG1 level 283 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 341 to 894)\\, and the IgG2 level 1750 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 171 to 632); the blood IgG3 and IgG4 levels were normal. Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) was negative\\, including an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase. A rapid plasma reagin test was nonreactive. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infection was negative. A diagnostic procedure was performed.,Systemic immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis."

    "ground_truth_output": "chest discomfort\\, and nodules on chest imaging. Three years before the current admission\\, the patient was evaluated by an orthopedist for pain in the hips and lower back\\, and glucocorticoid injections were administered. Twenty-two months before the current admission\\, the patient presented to her primary care physician because of diarrhea; 4 months later\\, she was evaluated by her primary care physician for bloody diarrhea. Testing of a stool specimen for giardia antigen\\, cryptosporidium antigen\\, and Clostridioides difficile toxin was negative. The blood level of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase IgA was undetectable\\, and the level of IgA was normal. A stool culture grew Bacillus cereus. The patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist; colonoscopy reportedly revealed markedly erythematous mucosa in the rectum\\, ending 10 cm proximal to the anus\\, with granularity and loss of vascularity. A biopsy specimen obtained during the colonoscopy reportedly showed evidence of diffuse active chronic colitis. Treatment with mesalamine was started\\, but her symptoms did not abate; the treatment was stopped after 4 months. During the next several months\\, the patient noticed progressive dyspnea and fatigue with exercise. Eight months before the current admission\\, she reported diffuse body and joint aches\\, especially of the lower back and hips\\, which prevented her from being able to run. Seven months before the current admission\\, she reported erythema\\, swelling\\, and pruritus in the right eye. Three months before the current admission\\, there was a recurrence of bloody diarrhea\\, and colonoscopy was repeated. Examination reportedly revealed perianal skin tags; congested and erythematous mucosa in the rectum\\, which was biopsied; and two 5-mm colonic polyps\\, which were excised. Dr. T. Leif Helland: Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimens obtained during colonoscopy reportedly revealed a tubular adenoma and a sessile serrated polyp\\, as well as moderately active chronic colitis. Treatment with mesalamine was resumed. Dr. Sporn: The next month\\, while doing heavy housework\\, the patient had new dyspnea and bilateral pleuritic chest-wall pain that was greater on the left side than on the right side\\, and she had to stop doing housework. The pain persisted for several days\\, the dyspnea worsened\\, and the patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital. On evaluation\\, she had diminished breath sounds and a normal electrocardiogram. Laboratory test results were notable for a normal N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level and normal white-cell and differential counts. The troponin I level was undetectable\\, and the D-dimer level was 3150 ng per milliliter (reference value\\, <500). A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Blood cultures were obtained. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Chest radiography reportedly revealed bilateral focal\\, patchy airspace opacities (Figure 1A). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, reportedly ruled out pulmonary embolism but showed multifocal pulmonary nodules that measured up to 18 mm in diameter (Figure 1B)\\, pleural effusions\\, and a kidney stone in the left kidney. FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies of the Chest. Dr. Sporn: A 5-day course of doxycycline\\, azithromycin\\, and prednisone was prescribed. Thirteen days later\\, approximately 2 months before the current admission\\, the patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospital because of continued dyspnea on exertion. The blood cultures that had been obtained during the previous visit to the emergency department were reportedly negative. White-cell and differential counts were normal\\, and the procalcitonin level was undetectable. Dr. Shepard: Repeat chest radiography reportedly revealed persistent consolidations and increased pleural effusion. Dr. Sporn: An additional 5-day course of prednisone and as-needed inhaled albuterol were prescribed. Four weeks later (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission)\\, the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the other hospital. The patient reported pleuritic pain on the right side of the chest; her symptoms and imaging findings were thought to be related to multifocal pneumonia and parapneumonic effusions. A 3-week tapering course of prednisone was prescribed. After completion of the prednisone course\\, the patient reported dyspnea with labored breathing\\, orthopnea\\, and chest discomfort. Repeat chest CT was performed\\, and the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. Dr. Shepard: The repeat chest CT\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, showed resolution of some of the nodules in the lingula and right upper lobe but also an overall increased number of nodules (Figure 1C and 1D). Dr. Sporn: Six days after her repeat chest CT (6 days before the current admission)\\, the patient was evaluated at the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. She reported that the prednisone had reduced the pain in the right side of her chest. Her exercise capacity had decreased from being able to run 5 miles to having dyspnea after running less than half a mile. A review of systems was notable for occasional night sweats\\, weight gain of 15 kg in the past year\\, a faint rash on the abdomen\\, blurred vision with swelling of the right eyelid that had lasted for 3 weeks\\, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon\\, diffuse joint stiffness and pain\\, and swelling of the fingers that limited some movements\\, such as opening jars. She had no fevers\\, chills\\, cough\\, nose or throat symptoms\\, eye pain or visual field loss\\, wheezing\\, palpitations\\, dizziness\\, nausea\\, vomiting\\, changes in bowel habits\\, urinary symptoms\\, or neurologic symptoms. She reported no sick contacts. Medical history was notable for hypothyroidism\\, multiple kidney stones\\, and depression. Medications included mesalamine\\, levothyroxine\\, and escitalopram\\, as well as lorazepam and inhaled albuterol as needed. The patient had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 5 years but had quit approximately 20 years before the current admission. She used cannabis oil\\, but there was no other history of substance use. She previously worked as an educator but had left her job because of illness. She lived in a small town in New England with her spouse and three children. Birds and cats were kept in the home\\, and she had previously had a cat bite. She reported that she had had no other environmental or occupational exposures. There was no travel history except for a commercial vacation cruise. Family history included celiac disease in her mother and lung cancer in her maternal grandfather\\, who had been a long-term smoker. The temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 95 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 129/81 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Examination was notable for intermittent shallow breathing and faint crackles in the right lung. The right eyelid was erythematous and mildly swollen. Blood levels of creatine kinase\\, aldolase\\, and rheumatoid factor were normal. Anti-Ro\\, anti-La\\, anti-Smith\\, anti-RNP\\, anti\u2013Jo-1\\, anti\u2013Scl-70\\, anti\u2013human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2\\, anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide\\, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were not detected. Serum tests for cryptococcal antigen and 1\\,3-\u03b2-d-glucan were negative\\, as were urine tests for blastomyces\\, coccidioides\\, and histoplasma antigens. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel were also negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

One week later (5 weeks before admission)\\, severe headache developed suddenly\\, along with blurred vision\\, dizziness\\, and nausea. After the administration of ondansetron\\, the blurred vision\\, dizziness\\, and nausea resolved; after the administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs\\, the headache became less severe\\, with mild pain and intermittent episodes of more severe pain. Three weeks before admission\\, the patient was seen in a neurology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She had difficulty recalling the history of her symptoms. On examination\\, she was oriented to place and person only and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations or to spell \u201cworld\u201d backward. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The complete blood count with differential count and test results for liver and kidney function were normal\\, as were blood levels of electrolytes\\, glucose\\, thiamine\\, and cobalamin. Tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no distinct epileptiform activity. Topiramate was prescribed for a working diagnosis of complex migraine. Imaging studies were obtained. TABLE 1  Laboratory Data.

T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed diffusely scattered hyperintensities in the periventricular\\, subcortical\\, and deep white matter and leptomeningeal enhancement. In addition\\, there was evidence of frontal superficial siderosis and a few scattered microhemorrhages. Dr. Manzano: Lumbar puncture was also performed. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis\\, the white-cell count was 46 per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 5)\\, with a lymphocyte count of 99% (reference range\\, 40 to 80)\\, the red-cell count was 35 per microliter (reference value\\, 0)\\, and the protein level was 221 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 13 to 40); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of the CSF were negative. The administration of topiramate was stopped; treatment with oral doxycycline was started but then was stopped after 5 days\\, when results of a test for Borrelia burgdorferi were interpreted as negative. Over the next 3 weeks\\, intermittent headache persisted and cognitive impairment worsened. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital. She was unable to provide a history. According to the patient\u2019s husband\\, the patient had stopped working and was no longer able to effectively care for herself\\, requiring assistance with daily activities such as bathing\\, dressing\\, and eating. She had difficulty planning and was unable to put on clothes in the correct sequence or to turn on the shower. Memory impairment persisted\\, conversation was tangential\\, and visual hallucinations frequently occurred. The patient had lost 6.8 kg in the past month. There was no fever\\, rash\\, or joint pain. The patient had a history of poliomyelitis in childhood\\, with residual mild weakness in the left leg; vitamin B12 deficiency\\, which had been corrected; and hypothyroidism. Medications included atorvastatin\\, levothyroxine\\, sertraline\\, vitamin B12\\, and cholecalciferol. She had a known allergy to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate with an unknown reaction. She was a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history\\, and she had consumed four alcoholic beverages per week before the onset of the current illness. The patient worked in a health care clinic and lived with her husband in a suburban area of New England. She had not traveled outside the United States. She was an avid gardener; she had a dog but no other animal exposures. Her father had received a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease at 62 years of age. On examination\\, the patient was alert and interactive. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 105/51 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 56 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.4. The patient was oriented to time\\, place\\, and person. Her speech was fluent\\, with intact naming\\, repetition\\, and comprehension. She had impaired abstraction and mildly impaired attention. She was unable to recall three objects after a delay. Intermittently during the examination\\, she had visual hallucinations that she knew were not real. Cranial nerve examination was unremarkable. Strength was 5/5 throughout\\, except in the left leg (4/5). Reflexes were brisk throughout\\, including 3+ reflexes in the arms and the right lower leg; pectoralis reflexes and a jaw jerk were present. No ankle clonus was noted. Examinations for tone\\, sensation\\, and cerebellar function were unremarkable. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Gonzalez: MRI of the head was performed (Figure 1). FLAIR images showed slight progression of the diffuse subarachnoid hyperintensities and leptomeningeal enhancement. Susceptibility-weighted images showed frontal superficial siderosis and scattered lobar microhemorrhages. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head revealed patent cranial vessels\\, without evidence of aneurysm\\, arteriovenous malformation\\, or thrombosis. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen\\, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, was normal. FIGURE 1  MRI of the Head. Dr. Manzano: Lumbar puncture was performed. On CSF analysis\\, the nucleated-cell count was 28 per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 5)\\, the lymphocyte count 85%\\, the red-cell count 53 per microliter\\, and the protein level 280 mg per deciliter. CSF was sent for culture and cytologic studies; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An EEG was normal. The patient was admitted to this hospital\\, and intravenous ceftriaxone\\, acyclovir\\, and methylprednisolone were administered. During the first 48 hours\\, the patient was agitated and impulsive. Visual hallucinations worsened\\, and olanzapine was administered. The CSF culture was negative\\, and the CSF cytologic studies showed no malignant cells.

    "ground_truth_output": "when he began to have difficulty seeing in both eyes. His vision was decreased when he woke up in the morning\\, improved throughout the day\\, and worsened again at night. Three weeks before the current admission\\, the patient told his parents about the vision changes. They took him to an optometry clinic for evaluation. Eyeglasses were not prescribed; a routine annual follow-up evaluation was scheduled. During the next 3 weeks\\, the patient noticed that the decrease in vision worsened. He typically walked on his toes and held onto his parents as he walked; however\\, 4 days before this admission\\, his parents noticed that he leaned on them heavily while walking. Two days before the current admission\\, they observed him walking into doors and walls and bumping into objects. On the day of this admission\\, the patient woke up screaming and panicked because he could not see. His parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation\\, the patient reported that his vision had improved slightly throughout the day. He described darkening of his vision that was worse in the left eye than in the right eye. He was having difficulty identifying movement and details of objects\\, although he was able to see shapes and colors. The parents reported that the patient had been having puffiness and crusting of the eyes for 2 days\\, with no eye redness or pain. Review of systems was notable for 3 days of diarrhea and nausea. He had no fever\\, headache\\, rashes\\, mouth sores\\, joint pain\\, or weakness. The patient was born prematurely\\, at 7 months\u2019 gestation. Labor and delivery had taken place outside the hospital setting\\, and perinatal hypoxia had occurred. The patient had been taken urgently to another hospital\\, where he was resuscitated and then hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit for 2 months. The patient had autism and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He had developmental delays in speech\\, language\\, cognition\\, and fine motor skills. He had received all routine childhood vaccinations and was taking risperidone; there were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his parents and older sister\\, all of whom were healthy. Ten months before this admission\\, they had moved from an urban area to a rural area in New England. The patient was in sixth grade and was enrolled in special education classes at school. He had been an avid player of video and virtual reality games\\, but his parents had removed the gaming systems from their home 2 months before the patient\u2019s vision changes had begun. He continued to watch videos on the computer and television; his parents noted that he did not sit close to the devices and sometimes looked at the wall instead of the screen. The patient\u2019s parents described him as a \u201cpicky eater.\u201d His diet consisted almost exclusively of hamburgers\\, french fries\\, ranch dressing\\, glazed doughnuts\\, and juice boxes. The patient avoided trying new foods and did not take vitamin pills or gummies because he disliked the taste or texture. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 104/71 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 94 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 156 cm (70th percentile)\\, the weight 40.3 kg (38th percentile)\\, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 16.6. The patient was pale\\, alert\\, interactive\\, and wary of the physical examination. Dr. Ryan A. Gise: Mild periorbital swelling was present. The visual acuity in both eyes was limited to hand motion. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light\\, and the extraocular movements were full. Color-vision testing\\, automated perimetry\\, fundus photography\\, and optical coherence tomography could not be performed because the patient had poor vision and was unable to cooperate. A slit-lamp examination was notable only for keratinization of the conjunctiva in both eyes. A funduscopic examination revealed pallor of the optic disk in both eyes. Examination of the peripheral retina was limited because the patient was unable to cooperate. Dr. Armstrong-Javors: Strength\\, sensation\\, reflexes\\, and coordination were normal. A gait examination revealed toe walking; the patient asked for assistance when walking. The abdomen was nontender. Horizontal ridges were present on the toenails (Figure 1)\\, and there were scattered bruises on the arms and legs. No ulcers or rashes were seen. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Over the next 2 days\\, chills\\, vomiting\\, neck pain\\, and headache with sonophobia developed. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital\\, where an evaluation reportedly showed dry mucous membranes but no signs of meningitis. The white-cell count was 12\\,300 per microliter (reference range\\, 4800 to 10\\,800)\\, and the platelet count was 95\\,000 per microliter (reference range\\, 150\\,000 to 450\\,000). Intravenous normal saline and morphine were administered\\, and the patient was discharged with supportive care for a presumed viral syndrome. During the next week\\, the patient had worsening headache and new photophobia\\, as well as malaise\\, anorexia\\, nonproductive cough\\, and dyspnea with minimal exertion. Two days before the current presentation\\, the patient\u2019s mother noticed episodes of confusion with nonsensical speech and excessive sleepiness\\, and she took the patient back to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation\\, the patient reported ongoing severe headaches and dyspnea. The temporal temperature was 38.0\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 106 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 100/55 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient had photophobia\\, but the neurologic examination was reportedly otherwise normal. She had mild throat erythema and diffuse abdominal tenderness with intermittent guarding. A urine test for beta human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Table 1  Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, reportedly showed subarachnoid hemorrhage and diffuse ischemic changes in the parietal and temporal lobes. Lumbar puncture was deferred because of thrombocytopenia. CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, reportedly showed diffuse interstitial lung markings\\, multiple opacities and nodules in the peripheral lung\\, two hypodensities in the peripheral spleen\\, and subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin\\, ceftriaxone\\, metronidazole\\, and doxycycline was administered. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital. The next morning\\, screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus\\, Epstein\u2013Barr virus\\, hepatitis B virus\\, and hepatitis C virus were negative\\, as was a blood-smear examination for parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Platelets were transfused\\, and intravenous normal saline was administered. The respiratory rate increased to 45 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation was 93% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 8 liters per minute; ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure was attempted\\, and intravenous furosemide was administered. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole were discontinued\\, and empirical treatment with intravenous meropenem and clindamycin was administered. The patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital. On arrival at this hospital\\, the patient had confusion and tachypnea and thus provided a limited history\\, but family members provided additional information. The patient had a history of depression\\, for which she received citalopram. She had no known drug allergies. She worked in health care. She drank wine socially\\, used electronic cigarettes\\, and occasionally smoked marijuana but did not smoke tobacco. Her most recent travel had been to the Caribbean more than 1 year before the current presentation. She had no exposure to wooded or rural areas. Her family had dogs\\, but she had no bites or scratches; she had no other animal or insect exposures. There were no recent sexual contacts. Her mother had cutaneous lupus erythematosus\\, and her maternal grandmother had Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 37.6\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 97 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 103/56 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 49 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 8 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22. The patient appeared to be in respiratory distress\\, with accessory muscles used for breathing. She was oriented only after prompting. She had meningismus and concomitant rigidity of the shoulders with passive range of motion\\, but she had no focal cranial-nerve\\, strength\\, or sensory deficits. Auscultation of the lungs and heart revealed diffuse rales and rhonchi\\, as well as a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur that was loudest at the apex and left axilla and radiated to the sternum. The spleen tip was palpable. A small patch of petechiae was present on the upper chest. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of phosphorus\\, globulin\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, and alanine aminotransferase were normal\\, as were the results of coagulation tests; antinuclear antibodies were undetectable. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional blood cultures were obtained. Chest radiography showed diffuse lung opacities and pleural effusions on both sides. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia with normal intervals and nonspecific minor ST- and T-wave changes. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin\\, meropenem\\, azithromycin\\, doxycycline\\, and acyclovir was administered. Four hours after admission\\, increased work of breathing\\, tachypnea\\, and confusion progressed\\, and the trachea was intubated for initiation of mechanical ventilation. Intravenous propofol\\, hydromorphone\\, and phenylephrine were administered. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed\\, revealing mildly bloody and frothy effluent from all the lobes of the lungs. On examination of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens\\, the nucleated-cell count was 375 per microliter\\, with 77% neutrophils. Gram\u2019s staining showed no organisms. Tests for common respiratory virus \u2014 including influenza A and B viruses\\, respiratory syncytial virus\\, adenovirus\\, and parainfluenza viruses \u2014 were negative. A culture was also obtained. Dr. Eric W. Zhang: CT of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed bilateral scattered curvilinear hyperdensities in the cortical sulci\\, findings suggestive of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (Figure 1A). There were also focal hypodense regions in the left superior parietal lobule and right temporal lobe with loss of normal gray\u2013white matter differentiation\\, findings suggestive of acute cortical infarcts (Figure 1B). CT pulmonary angiography showed evidence of mild interstitial edema\\, bilateral pleural effusions\\, and multifocal peribronchovascular nodular opacities and consolidations involving all the lobes of the lungs\\, some of which were peripherally distributed\\, without cavitation (Figure 1C). CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed several splenic hypodensities\\, which were most likely splenic infarcts\\, with accompanying mild ascites and mild periportal edema (Figure 1D). Figure 1  CT and MRI Images. Dr. McFadden: Platelets were transfused\\, and lumbar puncture was performed\\, with an opening pressure of 38 cm of water. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis\\, the glucose level was 41 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 50 to 75)\\, the protein level 31 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 5 to 55)\\, the red-cell count 2400 per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 5)\\, and the nucleated-cell count 49 per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 5)\\, with 76% neutrophils\\, 16% monocytes\\, and 8% lymphocytes. Dr. Zhang: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed multifocal subarachnoid sulcal hyperintensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging\\, findings that can be seen with subarachnoid hemorrhage or acute meningitis (Figure 1E). The focal hypodense regions in the left superior parietal lobule and right temporal lobe that had been noted previously on CT were associated with restricted diffusion on an apparent-diffusion-coefficient map (Figure 1F) and on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure 1G) from MRI of the head\\, which is compatible with bilateral acute cortical infarcts.,Infective endocarditis due to Haemophilus parainfluenzae."

There was evidence of a previous cholecystectomy\\, the common bile duct measured 7 mm in diameter (reference range\\, <10 mm after cholecystectomy)\\, and there was mild anasarca with diffuse mesenteric edema. On magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (Figure 1C and 1D)\\, the common bile duct again measured 7 mm in diameter; findings were otherwise normal. FIGURE 1  Initial Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Pelvis\\, Other Hospital. Dr. Bromberg: After admission to the other hospital\\, 1 unit of packed red cells was transfused\\, and the hemoglobin level remained stable thereafter. On the third hospital day\\, the patient could eat small amounts of food. On further questioning\\, the patient expressed suicidal ideation and reported a history of prolonged domestic abuse; she was evaluated by the psychiatry service. A diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder was made\\, and lorazepam was administered. The suicidal ideation resolved\\, but she was noted to need substantial assistance with self-care. While plans were being made for the patient\u2019s discharge to an assisted-living facility\\, the constipation worsened\\, and her oral intake decreased. On the seventh hospital day\\, vomiting developed\\, and the laboratory evaluation was notable for hyponatremia\\, with a blood sodium level of 120 mmol per liter (reference range\\, 135 to 145). A nasogastric tube was placed\\, and 3% hypertonic saline was administered intravenously. On the eighth day at the other hospital\\, additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Chung: Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1E and 1F)\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed multiple dilated\\, fluid-filled loops of small bowel that measured up to 4 cm in diameter and the presence of air\u2013fluid levels and an abrupt transition point in the right lower quadrant. Dr. Bromberg: Urine specimens had been sent for measurement of urinary porphyrin levels at the time of admission to the other hospital; the resulting levels were elevated (Table 1)\\, and the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. On admission to this hospital\\, the patient reported persistent abdominal pain\\, constipation\\, and anorexia. The vomiting had resolved after insertion of the nasogastric tube. She reported weight loss of 18 kg over the course of the previous 4 months while she was following a limited diet. In an effort to improve the patient\u2019s overall health\\, the patient\u2019s daughter had provided her with supplements and recommended a ketogenic diet consisting of protein and cooked vegetables. The patient also reported that she had been having difficulty with memory for 2 months before this admission. The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus\\, hypertension\\, and glaucoma. Her surgical history included remote cholecystectomy and hysterectomy. Medications included pantoprazole\\, ondansetron\\, and calcium carbonate in combination with cholecalciferol. The patient was allergic to ampicillin\\, penicillin\\, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole\\, doxycycline\\, tetracycline\\, erythromycin\\, nitrofurantoin\\, and nortriptyline \u2014 all with unknown reactions. She lived with her sister in suburban New England and reported that she was recently separated from her husband owing to long-standing domestic abuse. The patient had two children. She did not have contact with her son\\, and her daughter lived in India but visited regularly. Her mother had died from breast cancer. Her father and son both had bipolar affective disorder. The patient did not smoke tobacco\\, drink alcohol\\, or use illicit drugs. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 95 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 125/55 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.5. The patient appeared cachectic. There was a nasogastric tube in place. The conjunctivae were pale. The abdomen was soft and diffusely tender\\, without guarding\\, rigidity\\, or rebound tenderness. There was no rash. The patient was alert but inconsistently oriented to time\\, place\\, and person. Her speech was tangential\\, and she was unable to recite days of the week backward. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level was 9.1 g per deciliter (reference range\\, 12.0 to 16.0). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A peripheral-blood smear showed normochromic red cells with occasional burr cells and no schistocytes. Reticulocytes\\, basophilic stippling\\, and rare nucleated red cells were present; there were no blasts\\, and the white cells were morphologically normal. Dr. Chung: Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant revealed mildly increased echogenicity and mild coarsening of the liver parenchyma (Figure 2). The common bile duct measured 5 mm in diameter. FIGURE 2  Additional Imaging Studies of the Abdomen\\, This Hospital. Dr. Bromberg: Intravenous fluids and hemin were administered. On the third hospital day\\, the volume of output from the nasogastric tube remained elevated. The patient underwent surgical exploration for possible small-bowel obstruction. Dilated loops of small bowel with a transition point near the terminal ileum were observed; there was a loop of small bowel tethered underneath an adhesion band around which the cecum had volvulized. The adhesion was lysed\\, and the loop of small bowel released. There was no mass or stricture. A diagnosis was made.,Lead poisoning."

He received a prescription for a 1-week course of valacyclovir for the treatment of presumed shingles. No skin lesions developed\\, and the headache resolved. Four weeks before the current evaluation\\, hearing loss in the left ear developed during an airplane flight. The hearing loss persisted after the flight\\, and the patient began to have intermittent tinnitus in the left ear and redness in both eyes. He was evaluated by an otolaryngologist at a clinic affiliated with this hospital. He reported no vertigo\\, otorrhea\\, rhinitis\\, or sore throat. On examination\\, there was redness in both eyes. The right and left auricles and external auditory canals were normal\\, as was the right tympanic membrane. The left tympanic membrane was retracted; there was no middle-ear effusion. Results of the Weber test were inconsistent. The Rinne test was positive bilaterally\\, with air conduction greater than bone conduction. There was no sinus tenderness. Nasopharyngoscopy revealed midseptal deviation to the left; the posterior aspect of the nasopharynx was normal. The remainder of the examination\\, including a cranial nerve examination\\, was normal. An audiogram showed sloping mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. Results were asymmetric at low frequencies\\, with more severe hearing loss in the left ear than in the right ear from 125 to 2000 Hz (Figure 1A). Word recognition was 96% with the right ear and 84% with the left ear (reference range\\, 80 to 100). Results of tympanometry were normal in both ears.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head\\, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed no abnormal findings. FIGURE 1  Audiograms. Four weeks later\\, the patient was evaluated by a different otolaryngologist at the clinic affiliated with this hospital. Hearing loss had progressed. Eye redness had initially decreased after prednisone therapy was started but had subsequently recurred after prednisone therapy was stopped. On examination\\, there was redness in both eyes. There was no spontaneous nystagmus or gait ataxia. Sinusoidal gaze tracking was normal. The head-thrust test to the left was positive\\, a finding that indicates vestibular hypofunction on the left side. Results of the Romberg test were normal. The Fukuda step test was positive\\, with the patient rotated to the left\\, a finding that also indicates vestibular hypofunction on the left side. A repeat audiogram showed worsening of sensorineural hearing loss and reduction of word recognition to 90% with the right ear and 64% with the left ear (Figure 1B). Results of tympanometry were normal. The patient was referred for an urgent rheumatologic evaluation. Three days later\\, in the rheumatology clinic at this hospital\\, the patient reported ongoing hearing loss in both ears and redness in both eyes\\, as well as the recent onset of imbalance. He also reported that he had had fatigue and intermittent body aches for 2 months and that he had lost 5 kg of weight over a 6-month period. There was no history of oral or genital lesions; 6 weeks earlier\\, a nonpruritic patchy rash had developed on his torso after he received the influenza vaccine and had rapidly resolved with the use of an oral antihistamine. There was a history of irritable bowel syndrome\\, diverticulosis\\, gastritis\\, allergic rhinitis\\, and asthma. Medications included intranasal and inhaled fluticasone\\, vitamin B12\\, and omeprazole. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his wife in an urban area of New England. For the past 12 years\\, he had been sexually active with his wife only. He was a retired construction worker. He was a nonsmoker\\, drank alcohol rarely\\, and did not use illicit drugs. On examination\\, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 115/79 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 95 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There was redness in both eyes. The finger-rub test revealed grossly reduced hearing in both ears. The Romberg test was positive when the patient\u2019s eyes were open\\, a finding that indicates vestibular or cerebellar hypofunction. The remainder of the examination\\, including skin\\, joint\\, and neurologic assessments\\, was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal\\, as were results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The complete blood count with differential count was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour (reference range\\, 0 to 13)\\, and the C-reactive protein level 12.3 mg per liter (reference value\\, <8.0). The patient was referred for an urgent ophthalmologic evaluation at this hospital\\, which was to take place on the same day. On ophthalmologic evaluation\\, the patient reported no blurred vision\\, floaters\\, eye pain\\, itching\\, or photophobia. He wore contact lenses\\, which he changed daily. On examination\\, visual acuity was normal in both eyes. The right cornea had trace pinpoint epithelial deposits\\, a peripheral ring of punctate epithelial erosions\\, and several small confluent areas of punctate epithelial erosions centrally\\, with no infiltrate. The left cornea had a peripheral ring of punctate epithelial erosions and several confluent areas of punctate epithelial erosions centrally\\, with no infiltrate.

The pain was not relieved with the use of ibuprofen and had previously been evaluated and treated by a chiropractor. A neurologic examination revealed a slight decrease in taste and in sensation to touch and temperature on the left side of the face; a gait evaluation revealed a subtle leftward sway. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Byung C. Yoon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed subtle foci of hypodensity in the left cerebellum\\, a finding suggestive of infarction. There was no evidence of arterial dissection\\, aneurysm\\, stenosis\\, or thrombotic occlusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, confirmed the presence of a left medial cerebellar infarct and a small left lateral medullary infarct (Figure 1A\\, 1B\\, and 1C). FIGURE 1  MRI and CT Angiogram. Dr. Dudzinski: The patient had normal results on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis\\, echocardiography\\, and a hypercoagulability panel\\, except for a mildly elevated level of anticardiolipin IgM (18.9 IgM phospholipid units; reference range\\, 0 to 15). During the hospital admission\\, lesions with a vesicular appearance developed on the left side of the lips and oral cavity\\, and the patient was treated with famciclovir. He was discharged home while receiving aspirin\\, with a follow-up visit scheduled in the neurology clinic. One month later in the neurology clinic\\, the patient reported partial resolution of headache\\, persistent neck pain and ear pain with balance difficulty\\, and perioral paresthesia. There was diminished sensation on the left side of the face (similar to that observed during the previous examination). No oropharyngeal lesions were visible. An evaluation of gait and balance was normal. Dr. Yoon: Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed expected evolution of the left cerebellar infarct and no new infarction. The left posterior inferior cerebellar artery was not visualized\\, possibly because of occlusion or slow blood flow. Dr. Dudzinski: Repeat CSF analysis showed normal protein and glucose levels and 14 white cells per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 5)\\, of which 94% were lymphocytes. Gram\u2019s staining showed no organisms. CSF tests for borrelia and varicella DNA and for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus antibodies were negative. Two days later\\, cerebral angiography revealed mild narrowing of the origin of the left vertebral artery. Tests for antinuclear antibodies\\, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\\, and anti-La and anti-Ro antibodies were negative\\, as was a rapid plasma reagin test. The patient received follow-up care at another hospital until the current evaluation\\, when he presented to the emergency department of this hospital with 3 days of severe pain on exertion that affected the left side of the neck and left temporo-occipital region. The symptoms were similar to those he had reported in the past and were not relieved with the use of ibuprofen or marijuana. The head pain was described as pulsating and pounding\\, and it worsened when he was in the supine position. The patient reported right flank pain; the onset of this pain had occurred with lifting of a heavy object and had just preceded the onset of headache. He also reported a tendency to bruise. The review of systems was otherwise normal. His medical history was notable for dyslipidemia. He had undergone repair of meniscus tears in both knees and repair of a traumatic dislocation of the right shoulder. Medications included rosuvastatin and gemfibrozil\\, as well as acetaminophen as needed. There were no known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was a self-employed laborer and lived with his wife and children in a suburb of Boston. He smoked cigars and marijuana occasionally\\, and he drank up to eight beers per day on weekends. His family history was notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia in both of his parents\\, as well as early-onset dementia in his father. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 176/119 mm Hg in both arms\\, the heart rate 72 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A neurologic examination revealed a mild decrease in coordination in the left hand but was otherwise normal. Blood levels of electrolytes\\, troponin T\\, C-reactive protein\\, lipoprotein(a)\\, and glycated hemoglobin were normal\\, as were the prothrombin time\\, partial-thromboplastin time\\, and results of renal function tests.

There was no evidence of acute ischemia. MRI of the head\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, did not reveal any evidence of infarction or a perfusion abnormality. However\\, a T1-weighted image showed a focus of intrinsic hyperintensity along the left vertebral artery\\, a finding consistent with hemorrhage within the vessel wall from the dissection (Figure 1F). Dr. Dudzinski: The patient was admitted to the neurology service. Control of the blood pressure required multiple medications. Echocardiography showed no cardiac\\, valvular\\, or aortic structural abnormality. Right flank pain recurred. Urinalysis showed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field but was otherwise normal. Dr. Yoon: CT of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed dissection of the right renal artery\\, extending from the origin of the artery to subsegmental renal arteries. Perinephric fat stranding was present on the right side\\, and there were areas of diminished enhancement in the right kidney. These findings were suggestive of infarction (Figure 2).

    "user_input": "Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 78-year-old man was evaluated in the cardiology clinic of this hospital because of biventricular myocardial wall thickening\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "progressive mitral regurgitation\\, and ventricular arrhythmias. The patient had been a distinguished multisport athlete in high school and college. However\\, in his 20s\\, he found that he was unable to perform competitively\\, and he noticed that he did not sweat as much as his teammates. After an episode of sports-related exertional dizziness\\, he was evaluated by a physician\\, and a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was considered. Twenty-five years before the current evaluation\\, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 19 mm (reference value\\, \u226411)\\, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 74% (reference range\\, 50 to 75)\\, mitral valve thickening\\, and trace mitral regurgitation\\, with no left ventricular outflow gradient. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm\\, incomplete right bundle-branch block\\, precordial J-point elevation\\, and QRS voltage that met the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure 1A). The patient\u2019s blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg\\, and he started treatment with metoprolol succinate and then also with amlodipine for elevated blood pressure. FIGURE 1  Electrocardiograms. During the next 10 years\\, the patient had intermittent chest discomfort\\, exertional dyspnea\\, and leg edema. The chest discomfort and exertional dyspnea were most likely to occur when he was walking or after he had eaten a meal. He was evaluated by three cardiologists; treatment with metoprolol succinate and amlodipine was continued\\, treatment with enalapril was started\\, and triamterene\u2013hydrochlorothiazide was administered as needed for leg edema. A repeat TTE reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 20 mm\\, a normal left ventricular ejection fraction\\, right ventricular wall thickening\\, left atrial enlargement\\, mitral valve thickening\\, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation\\, aortic valve thickening\\, and mild ascending aortic dilatation (39 mm)\\, with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. An exercise stress test followed by imaging performed with the use of sestamibi (known as a sestamibi stress test) revealed left ventricular wall thickening\\, with no perfusion defects. Coronary angiography revealed evidence of chronic total occlusion of the distal left anterior descending artery\\, with collateral flow from both the left and right coronary arteries. Left ventriculography revealed hyperdynamic left ventricular function and 2+ mitral regurgitation (see Video 1\\, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 28 mm Hg (reference range\\, 5 to 10)\\, with no left ventricular intracavitary gradient\\, including during ventricular ectopic beats and during the Valsalva maneuver\\, and with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The blood pressure remained well controlled while the patient was taking metoprolol\\, amlodipine\\, and enalapril. Nine years before the current evaluation\\, the patient had complete heart block with symptomatic bradycardia (Figure 1B)\\, with associated nausea\\, dizziness\\, and chest discomfort. A temporary transvenous pacing wire was placed; the results of coronary angiography performed at that time were unchanged from the previous study. The creatinine level was 1.2 mg per deciliter (106 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range\\, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]); the blood levels of electrolytes and thyrotropin were normal\\, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis. A dual-chamber implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) was placed. Four months later\\, atrial fibrillation developed. Cardioversion was performed with guidance by transesophageal echocardiography\\, resulting in sinus rhythm. However\\, atrial fibrillation recurred after 3 days. Treatment with amiodarone and warfarin was begun. During the next 5 years\\, recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. A repeat TTE showed a left ventricular wall thickness of 23 mm and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Four years before the current evaluation\\, during a holiday trip\\, the patient was hospitalized in another state because of pulmonary edema that developed after he had consumed food that was high in sodium. He was treated with intravenous furosemide and discharged with a prescription for oral furosemide. Findings on TTE were reportedly similar to those observed previously. Treatment with amlodipine was stopped because of lightheadedness. At follow-up appointments during the next 4 years\\, the patient reported fatigue and exertional dyspnea that occurred after he had climbed one flight of stairs or when he was walking on an incline. In addition\\, he had nocturia once per night\\, slept on two pillows\\, and had intermittent wheezing\\, including episodes that awakened him from sleep. Treatment with oral furosemide (administered twice daily) was continued. Recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. Approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation\\, the patient sustained a fall that was unrelated to his cardiac condition. At that time\\, computed tomography of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, did not reveal any evidence of hemorrhage or stroke but showed periventricular and deep white-matter hypodensities. Results of pulmonary-function testing were normal. The patient presented for the current evaluation at the request of his two teenage grandsons\\, who wanted to know about any familial cardiac risk factors that could influence their participation in sports. A review of systems was notable for intermittent palpitations\\, chronic dry eyes\\, reduced hearing\\, tinnitus in both ears (greater in the right ear than in the left ear)\\, restless legs\\, and constipation. The patient reported no headache\\, paresthesia\\, stroke symptoms\\, diarrhea\\, skin changes\\, or intolerance to heat or cold. His medical history included cardiomyopathy\\, coronary artery disease\\, atrioventricular block and atrial fibrillation\\, dyslipidemia\\, hypertension\\, progressive renal insufficiency\\, cataracts\\, and prostatic hypertrophy with carcinoma in situ. Medications included furosemide\\, warfarin\\, amiodarone\\, aspirin\\, atorvastatin\\, metoprolol\\, enalapril\\, and tamsulosin\\, as well as inhaled fluticasone. Amiodarone had caused thyroiditis\\, which had been treated with a course of prednisone; there were no other known adverse reactions to medication. The patient was a retired executive and lived with his spouse in Massachusetts. His family history was notable for brain cancer in his father\\, obstructive lung disease and lung cancer in his mother\\, and lung cancer in his sister\\, who had died from the disease. There was also a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in his sister and in a niece. His family was of Mediterranean origin; information about other relatives was limited. His son and grandsons were healthy\\, and his son had reportedly had normal results on an electrocardiogram and echocardiograms. The patient did not drink alcohol and had never used tobacco. On examination\\, the heart rate was 79 beats per minute and the blood pressure 106/60 mm Hg. The weight was 89 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 26.6. There was a left ventricular heave. Auscultation revealed splitting of the S2 heart sound\\, a grade 3/6 systolic murmur that could be heard throughout the precordium and did not change during the Valsalva maneuver\\, and a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiated to the axilla; there was no S3 heart sound. There was trace leg edema and mild chronic venous stasis. The rest of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results were notable for a creatinine level of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 \u03bcmol per liter)\\, a urea nitrogen level of 39 mg per deciliter (13.9 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter])\\, an international normalized ratio of 2.1 (reference range\\, 0.9 to 1.1)\\, and an N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2523 pg per milliliter (reference range\\, 0 to 1800)\\, as well as 1+ protein on urinalysis. The blood levels of iron\\, glycated hemoglobin\\, thyrotropin\\, and free thyroxine were normal\\, and a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing. A TTE was obtained\\, and additional diagnostic tests were performed.,Fabry\u2019s disease."

    "ground_truth_output": "nausea\\, vomiting\\, abdominal pain and tenderness\\, and headache. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before this admission\\, when fever\\, rigors\\, nausea\\, and vomiting developed. During the next 3 days\\, the symptoms worsened; the patient was unable to eat\\, drink\\, or take medications. She reported abdominal pain and cramping on the left side that she described as being similar to previous flares of ulcerative colitis; she also had nonbloody diarrhea. The patient called the obstetrics clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for fatigue\\, mild headache\\, neck pain\\, and photophobia. The patient reported no hematochezia\\, pelvic pain\\, vaginal bleeding\\, dysuria\\, or joint pain. Ulcerative colitis had been diagnosed 11 years earlier; at the time of the diagnosis\\, she began treatment with azathioprine but stopped after 1 year because of severe fatigue. The patient had taken mesalamine and sulfasalazine intermittently for disease flares but typically stopped after a few months of treatment. Exacerbations of ulcerative colitis occurred approximately every year and were associated with fevers\\, rigors\\, nausea\\, vomiting\\, abdominal pain\\, and bloody diarrhea. Nine months before this admission\\, Clostridioides difficile colitis developed\\, and the patient was successfully treated with oral vancomycin. Three weeks before the current admission\\, she was admitted to this hospital for a flare of ulcerative colitis; intravenous methylprednisolone\\, hydromorphone\\, and ondansetron were administered\\, and mesalamine was restarted. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed mild erythema and friable mucosa with a decreased vascular pattern in the sigmoid colon. Dr. Craig R. Audin: A transvaginal ultrasound image obtained during that admission showed a single viable intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks of gestation and trace subchorionic hemorrhage. Dr. Tran: The patient was discharged after 7 days once most of the symptoms had abated\\, although nausea persisted. The patient had had two previous successful pregnancies that had resulted in cesarean deliveries at full term. The patient reported that she had received all the usual childhood immunizations. Routine prenatal serologic screening during the current pregnancy showed immunity to varicella but not to rubella. Tests for syphilis\\, hepatitis B virus surface antigen\\, gonorrhea\\, chlamydia\\, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Other history included anemia\\, chronic back pain\\, migraines\\, post-traumatic stress disorder\\, depression\\, and anxiety. At the time of the current admission\\, medications included prednisone\\, mesalamine\\, omeprazole\\, ondansetron\\, hydromorphone\\, tramadol\\, cyclobenzaprine\\, sumatriptan\\, gabapentin\\, lorazepam\\, sertraline\\, pyridoxine\\, cholecalciferol\\, and prenatal vitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with her male partner\\, with whom she was monogamous\\, as well as her two children. She worked as an administrator. She did not eat sushi or rare or raw meat\\, and she did not consume unpasteurized milk or cheese. She had no known sick contacts or exposure to animals. The patient did not smoke tobacco\\, drink alcohol\\, or use illicit substances. Her mother had coronary artery disease\\, her father inflammatory bowel disease\\, and her sister depression. Her brother and two children were well. On examination\\, the temperature was 38.2\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 118/61 mm Hg\\, the pulse 116 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared tired and uncomfortable. The abdominal examination was remarkable for a healed surgical scar; there was diffuse tenderness that was most painful in the lower quadrants. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level was 7.7 g per deciliter (reference range\\, 12.0 to 16.0)\\, which was similar to the patient\u2019s baseline level. Urinalysis was normal. Blood specimens were obtained for microbiologic culture. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1  Laboratory Data.

There was trace fluid in the right lower quadrant; however\\, the appendix was not visualized (Figure 1B). FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies of the Abdomen. Dr. Tran: Intravenous fluids\\, ondansetron\\, acetaminophen\\, and hydromorphone were administered; mesalamine was continued\\, and a tapering of the prednisone dose was begun. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and care. The next day\\, the abdominal pain persisted and was most severe in the right upper and right lower quadrants. The headache had increased in severity; it was pulsating in quality and was worst in the frontal region\\, with radiation to the occipital region and posterior neck. There was mild photophobia but no neck stiffness or limitation in the range of motion in the neck. Empirical treatment with intravenous ampicillin\u2013sulbactam and prophylaxis with oral vancomycin were started. On the third hospital day\\, the systolic blood pressure declined to 70 mm Hg; after intravenous fluids were administered\\, the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Ultrasound images of the uterus obtained at the bedside confirmed a fetal heartbeat. A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless\\, with a glucose level of 63 mg per deciliter (3.5 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a protein level of 17 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 5 to 55). There were 0 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 5). Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF revealed no neutrophils and very few mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified. Dr. Audin: Three days later\\, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1C through 1F)\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a normal gravid uterus. On T2-weighted imaging\\, there were rounded areas of myometrial thickening with low signal intensity that were consistent with focal myometrial contractions\\, as well as a thin band of low signal intensity surrounding the fetus that was consistent with chorioamniotic separation; both of these findings were considered to be normal in the first trimester. The appendix was normal\\, without wall thickening\\, dilatation\\, or adjacent inflammatory changes. Although evaluation of the bowel was limited in the absence of oral and intravenous contrast material\\, the rectum also appeared normal\\, without obvious signs of active or chronic inflammation. A diagnosis was made.,Listeria monocytogenes bacteremia resulting in loss of fetus."

    "user_input": "Dr. Carrie Chui (Neurology): A 79-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of involuntary movements on the left side and transient unresponsiveness. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before admission\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "when involuntary movements of the left shoulder and left side of the face developed. The movements were described by the patient as twitching\\, were not associated with a change in the level of consciousness\\, and resolved after 1 to 2 minutes. During the next 6 months\\, the patient had similar episodes approximately once per month\\, but the episodes increased in duration\\, lasting 5 to 6 minutes. Three months before admission\\, the episodes of involuntary movements increased in frequency\\, and the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The physical examination was normal. Results of kidney-function tests were normal\\, as were blood levels of glucose and electrolytes\\, except for the sodium level\\, which was 129 mmol per liter (reference range\\, 135 to 145). There was a history of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion\\, and the sodium level was similar to levels obtained during the past 4 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A)\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a focus of enhancement in the right middle frontal gyrus that was thought to be a small vascular anomaly. Electroencephalography (EEG)\\, performed with the patient in awake and drowsy states\\, revealed rare\\, brief\\, focal slowing in the left temporal lobe during drowsiness; no epileptiform abnormalities were present. FIGURE 1  MRI of the Head and CT Angiogram of the Head and Neck. Two months before admission\\, the patient was evaluated in the epilepsy clinic affiliated with this hospital. He reported that the episodes of involuntary movements had increased in both frequency and duration\\, occurring once or twice per day and lasting approximately 10 minutes. Episodes began with tingling and numbness in the left leg that prompted the patient to voluntarily stomp the left foot to relieve the uncomfortable sensation. Then\\, the patient had involuntary movements that he described as an uncontrollable invisible force moving the left leg and arm\\, with hyperextension of the arm backward and pronation of the wrist. There was associated numbness in the distal portions of the left third\\, fourth\\, and fifth fingers and involuntary movement of the left cheek. No prodromal symptoms occurred. The patient had awareness during the episodes\\, and after the episodes\\, he felt fatigued but had a normal level of consciousness\\, without confusion. The examination in the epilepsy clinic was normal. A diagnosis of seizure disorder was considered\\, and treatment with levetiracetam was started. Three weeks before admission\\, the patient was again evaluated in the epilepsy clinic. He reported that the episodes of involuntary movements still occurred on a daily basis but had decreased in duration and involved only the left leg\\, without abnormal movements of the arm or face. Dizziness\\, headache\\, and weakness had developed and were attributed to the use of levetiracetam. The patient\u2019s family had recorded a video of one of the episodes of involuntary movements. After reviewing the video\\, the patient\u2019s neurologist thought that the episodes were less likely to be caused by seizures and more consistent with choreoathetoid movements. Cross-tapering of medications \u2014 with the simultaneous administration of levetiracetam in decreasing doses and clobazam in increasing doses \u2014 was initiated\\, and the patient was referred to the movement disorders clinic affiliated with this hospital. On the morning of admission\\, an episode of involuntary movements of the left leg and left shoulder occurred and persisted for 1 hour. Several hours after the symptoms abated\\, the patient\u2019s wife found the patient to be unresponsive; he was sitting in a chair. Emergency medical services were called\\, and when they arrived\\, the patient was responsive. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 180 mg per deciliter (10.0 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department\\, the patient reported dysuria and increased urinary frequency. The patient\u2019s daughter noted that he had been more anxious during the past 3 years and occasionally had trouble with memory. Other medical history included Barrett\u2019s esophagus\\, benign prostatic hypertrophy\\, chronic hepatitis B virus infection\\, eczema\\, gastroesophageal reflux disease\\, hypertension\\, nonischemic cardiomyopathy\\, and osteoporosis. There was no history of head trauma or extended loss of consciousness. Medications included aspirin\\, atorvastatin\\, doxazosin\\, finasteride\\, omeprazole\\, metoprolol\\, sacubitril\\, and valsartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol rarely; he did not use illicit drugs. His mother had had gastric cancer\\, and his sister had had esophageal cancer; there was no family history of seizures. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 152/97 mm Hg\\, the pulse 65 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.7. The blood pressure decreased to 130/63 mm Hg with standing. The patient was alert and interactive. The lower jaw was held to the left\\, but the nasolabial folds and smile were symmetric with activation. There were nonrhythmic\\, nonstereotyped\\, writhing movements of the left arm. Tone was normal\\, and strength was assessed as 5 out of 5 in the arms and legs. Results of liver-function and kidney-function tests were normal\\, as were blood levels of glucose and electrolytes\\, except for the sodium level\\, which was 125 mmol per liter. The lactate level was 2.1 mmol per liter (19 mg per deciliter; reference range\\, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]). The urinalysis was normal. Intravenous fluids were administered. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Rajiv Gupta: Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1B) revealed extensively calcified plaque with severe stenosis of the distal right common carotid artery (CCA)\\, extending into the proximal right internal carotid artery (ICA)\\, as well as stenosis of the right and left paraclinoid ICAs and the left vertebral artery at its origin. There was no vascular abnormality on the CT angiogram that corresponded to the abnormality in the right middle frontal gyrus seen on the previous MRI. Dr. Chui: The patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day\\, the sodium level had increased to 130 mmol per liter\\, and the lactate level was normal. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Gupta: MRI of the head showed no evidence of acute infarction. The focus of enhancement in the right frontal lobe that had been noted previously was not seen on the current MRI. Dr. Chui: Blood levels of thyrotropin\\, cobalamin\\, and glycated hemoglobin and results of coagulation tests were normal. Screening tests for Lyme disease\\, tuberculosis\\, and syphilis were negative\\, as were tests for antibodies to cardiolipin and \u03b22-glycoprotein. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive\\, at a titer of 1:160 in a homogeneous pattern. During a physical therapy session\\, the patient had abnormal movements of the left leg\\, left arm\\, and left side of the face. The abnormal movements diminished when the patient used distraction techniques\\, such as thigh tapping\\, finger snapping\\, and walking while holding a glass of water. The transient unresponsiveness that led to the patient\u2019s admission was attributed to a combination of sedation from clobazam and hypovolemia. Treatment with clobazam was stopped\\, and hydration was encouraged. A diagnosis of functional neurologic disorder was considered; outpatient physical therapy with continued use of distraction techniques was recommended. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day. Episodes of involuntary movements continued to occur on a daily basis at home. Two weeks after discharge\\, when the patient was doing exercises while sitting in a chair and having a conversation with his wife\\, he suddenly stopped talking. She found him slumped in the chair with his eyes closed\\, no longer exercising. When she asked him questions\\, he repeatedly said \u201cyes.\u201d Emergency medical services were called\\, and when they arrived\\, the patient was alert\\, diaphoretic\\, and nonverbal. He had a facial droop on the left side and a right gaze preference. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 130 mg per deciliter (7.2 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department\\, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 143/63 mm Hg\\, the pulse 66 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and interactive. There was a facial droop on the left side. There was no effort against gravity in the left arm. The patient was able to lift the left leg off the bed for 1 to 2 seconds. He had a right gaze deviation that could not be overcome and mild dysarthria. The remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of stroke was considered\\, and emergency CT angiography was performed. Dr. Gupta: CT angiography showed no evidence of acute territorial infarction and no changes in cerebrovascular disease. Dr. Chui: On repeat physical examination performed after CT angiography\\, the gaze deviation and dysarthria had resolved\\, and strength was normal. Mild facial paralysis was present. A diagnosis was made.,Limb-shaking transient ischemic attacks."

Polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of a swab specimen obtained from the perianal vesicle detected the presence of nonvariola orthopoxvirus DNA. Species-specific real-time PCR testing confirmed the presence of mpox virus (MPXV; formerly known as monkeypox virus)\\, clade II. The patient was called and instructed to return to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation\\, the patient reported a new rash on his chest\\, abdomen\\, and back that was similar to the perianal rash. He reported new fever\\, chills\\, fatigue\\, malaise\\, and headache. There was no weight loss\\, sore throat\\, or cough. Numerous scattered\\, tender\\, shallow ulcers were present on the chest\\, abdomen\\, and back\\, in addition to five tender\\, umbilicated pustules and one shallow ulcer in the perianal area (Figure 1). Treatment with tecovirimat was started. The patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up in the sexual health clinic of this hospital. FIGURE 1  Photographs of the Skin. During the next 2 days\\, the patient took tecovirimat. On the day of the current evaluation\\, he called the sexual health clinic because of redness and throbbing\\, pressurelike pain of the right eye. He was instructed to return to the emergency department of this hospital. On the current evaluation\\, the patient reported that redness and discomfort of the right eye had started after he had been discharged from the emergency department and had increased in severity and become painful during the subsequent 2 days. He rated the pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10\\, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He did not have blurry vision\\, photophobia\\, flashing lights\\, or floaters. There were no symptoms in the left eye. Since the initiation of antiviral therapy\\, the fever\\, chills\\, and headache had resolved\\, and the rectal pain had decreased in severity. There was no rhinorrhea or cough. The patient had a history of syphilis\\, which had occurred 5 years earlier and had been treated with intramuscular penicillin G. Since receiving the diagnosis of mpox\\, he had learned that syphilis and mpox had been diagnosed in one of his sexual partners from the previous month. Medications included tecovirimat and valacyclovir. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England and worked in the food-service industry. He did not smoke cigarettes\\, drink alcohol\\, or use illicit drugs. He did not know his family history. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C. The uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light\\, without a relative afferent pupillary defect\\, and extraocular movements were full. The intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg in the right eye and 17 mm Hg in the left eye (normal range\\, 10 to 21). When proparacaine drops were administered to check the intraocular pressure\\, the pain in the right eye did not decrease in severity. There was mild tenderness on palpation of the right globe under the closed eyelid. Slit-lamp examination revealed mild meibomian-gland dysfunction in both eyes; there was no eyelid edema or erythema. The right conjunctiva was diffusely injected\\, with severe bulbar hyperemia (Figure 2A). The right caruncle was boggy and erythematous. On eversion of the eyelids\\, small-to-medium-sized follicles and tarsal conjunctival petechiae were observed on the right lower and upper lids (Figure 2B and 2C). The left conjunctiva was normal. The cornea\\, anterior chamber\\, iris\\, and lens appeared normal in both eyes. Dilated funduscopic examination was performed. The vitreous\\, optic nerve\\, retinal vasculature\\, macula\\, and periphery appeared normal in both eyes. FIGURE 2  Photographs of the Right Eye. A diagnosis was made.,Mpox conjunctivitis."

    "user_input": "Dr. Kevin S. Oh (Radiation Oncology): A 45-year-old woman was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital because of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The patient had been well until 6 years before the current presentation\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "when she noticed a mass in the right breast. She was evaluated in the oncology clinic of another hospital\\, and mammography and ultrasonography of the right breast confirmed the presence of a mass. A core-needle biopsy was performed\\, and pathological examination of the specimen revealed invasive ductal carcinoma with no lymphovascular invasion. Lumpectomy of the right breast\\, along with sentinel-node biopsy of the right axilla\\, was performed. Dr. Baris Boyraz: Pathological examination of the specimen that was obtained by means of lumpectomy confirmed the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient\u2019s tumor was grade 3 (measuring 2.5 cm in diameter)\\, negative for estrogen receptor\\, weakly positive (<5% of tumor cells) for progesterone receptor\\, and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)\\, findings consistent with a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer. Three sentinel lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma\\, and there was no lymphovascular invasion. Genetic testing revealed no pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Dr. Oh: The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin\\, cyclophosphamide\\, and paclitaxel\\, followed by radiation therapy to the right breast. During the subsequent 3.5 years\\, surveillance imaging showed no evidence of disease recurrence. Eighteen months before the current presentation\\, weakness and numbness developed in the left arm and resolved spontaneously after 15 minutes. During the subsequent 4 weeks\\, the patient had similar episodes of left-arm weakness and numbness\\, which occurred 1 or 2 times per week. When the episodes did not abate\\, she sought evaluation in the emergency department of the other hospital. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Karen Rodriguez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A)\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a partially cystic mass in the right precentral gyrus. The mass measured 3.5 cm in diameter\\, with peripheral enhancement and local mass effect. FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies of the Head and Chest. Dr. Oh: The patient was transferred to this hospital for neurosurgical management. The episodes of arm weakness and numbness were attributed to seizures; treatment with dexamethasone and levetiracetam was started. Right frontal craniotomy was performed\\, and the mass was resected. Dr. Boyraz: Pathological examination of tissue obtained from the resected mass (Figure 2A\\, 2B\\, and 2C) revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive mitotic and apoptotic activity. The tumor cells had patchy positivity for GATA-3\\, a transcription factor expressed by breast tissue\\, which supported a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma originating in the breast. Further studies revealed the tumor to be estrogen-receptor\u2013negative and progesterone-receptor\u2013negative\\, with a HER2 score on immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of 1+ (incomplete\\, faint membrane staining in >10% of tumor cells)\\, and programmed death ligand 1 expression of less than 1%\\, findings that are consistent with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Next-generation sequencing revealed variants in FOXL2\\, CCND3\\, TP53\\, and FLT3. An RNA fusion assay did not show fusion transcripts. FIGURE 2  Biopsy Specimens of the Brain Mass and Lung. Dr. Rodriguez: Positron-emission tomography\u2013computed tomography (PET-CT) (Figure 1B and 1C)\\, performed after the administration of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer\\, showed a conglomerate lymph-node mass in the right perihilar region with intense FDG avidity. Dr. Oh: After surgery\\, the patient had an uneventful recovery\\, and the episodes of weakness and numbness resolved. She was discharged home with planned follow-up in the oncology clinic. Radiation therapy was administered to the brain\\, and treatment with capecitabine was initiated. However\\, 11 months before the current presentation\\, the episodes recurred. The dose of levetiracetam was increased\\, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Rodriguez: MRI of the head\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed multiple new enhancing lesions with features consistent with metastasis\\, including a lesion in the right occipital lobe that measured 3 mm in diameter. Postsurgical changes related to the craniotomy on the right side and the resection of the mass in the right precentral gyrus were also present. Dr. Oh: Stereotactic radiosurgery to the right occipital metastasis was performed. Dr. Rodriguez: Seven months before the current presentation\\, PET-CT\\, performed after the administration of FDG tracer\\, showed an increase in the size of the right perihilar mass with intense FDG avidity\\, as well as new FDG avidity in a right lower paratracheal lymph node. Dr. Oh: Treatment with capecitabine was discontinued. The patient was enrolled in a clinical trial\\, and treatment with oral paclitaxel was initiated (ClinicalTrials.gov number\\, NCT03326102). Dr. Rodriguez: Five months before the current presentation\\, MRI of the head revealed a new enhancing lesion in the right superior frontal gyrus\\, measuring 7 mm in diameter. The right occipital lesion was not seen. Dr. Oh: The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to the right frontal metastasis. During the subsequent 5 months\\, treatment with oral paclitaxel was continued. Two weeks before the current presentation\\, nonproductive cough developed. There was no shortness of breath\\, orthopnea\\, or chest pain. The patient had not had additional episodes of weakness and numbness in the left arm\\, and no headache or vision changes had occurred. Other medical history included depression. Medications included oral paclitaxel\\, levetiracetam\\, paroxetine\\, prochlorperazine as needed for nausea\\, lorazepam as needed for anxiety\\, and acetaminophen as needed for musculoskeletal pain. Penicillin had caused rash. The patient was a teacher and lived with her husband and two children in a rural area of New England. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her maternal grandmother had died of leukemia\\, and her paternal grandfather had died of prostate cancer. At the current presentation\\, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 116/73 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 67 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were well-healed craniotomy and lumpectomy scars. The breasts had no skin changes\\, masses\\, or tenderness. There was no palpable cervical\\, supraclavicular\\, axillary\\, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was normal. The complete blood count and the results of kidney-function tests were normal\\, as were the blood levels of electrolytes\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, alkaline phosphatase\\, total protein\\, albumin\\, and globulin. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Rodriguez: MRI of the head revealed a new peripherally enhancing lesion in the left precentral gyrus\\, measuring 6 mm in diameter\\, as well as a new enhancing lesion in the right superior frontal gyrus\\, measuring 1 mm in diameter. Full-body PET-CT\\, performed after the administration of FDG tracer\\, showed enlargement of the conglomerate lymph-node mass in the right perihilar region\\, which was encasing the bronchus of the right upper lobe and occluding the bronchus of the right middle lobe. In addition\\, there was severe narrowing of the right superior pulmonary vein. Dr. Oh: Treatment with oral paclitaxel was stopped\\, and the patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to the metastasis involving the left frontal lobe. Management decisions were made.,Triple-negative breast cancer with metastasis to the lung and brain."

    "user_input": "Dr. Zandra E. Walton (Medicine): A 67-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of headache and retro-orbital pain. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 10 months before the current admission\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "when a photosensitive\\, erythematous\\, papular rash developed on the forearms a few weeks after she had started treatment with hydrochlorothiazide. Over the next 7 months\\, an intermittent\\, painless\\, nonpruritic\\, erythematous\\, annular rash developed on the trunk and the proximal portions of the arms and legs. Three months before the current presentation\\, the rashes worsened\\, and the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist at another hospital. The thyrotropin level was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of a punch-biopsy specimen of abdominal skin reportedly showed spongiotic dermatitis with superficial perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory-cell infiltrate with eosinophils; neither vasculitis nor dermal mucin was found. The rashes were thought to be related to medication; treatment with amlodipine was started\\, and hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. She was treated with topical triamcinolone ointment. The photosensitive rash on the forearms resolved\\, and the annular rash on the trunk abated. TABLE 1  Laboratory Data.

The physical examination was reportedly normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 mm per hour (reference range\\, 0 to 19). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, and total bilirubin were normal\\, as were the results of tests of kidney function. Computed tomography (CT) of the head was performed and reportedly showed mild periventricular white-matter disease with no acute intracranial abnormality. CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed no intracranial aneurysm\\, stenosis\\, or occlusion. The patient was discharged home. The next morning\\, the patient awoke with double vision. The headache had resolved. She presented to a neuro-ophthalmology urgent care clinic associated with this hospital. The patient reported persistent pain in the left eye\\, which was worse with abduction\\, as well as photosensitivity and an episode of pain in the left side of the jaw in the preceding week. She had normal visual acuity\\, color vision\\, visual fields\\, and afferent visual function. The optic disks were normal\\, sharp\\, and flat. The left eye had esotropia and hypertropia\\, as well as a limitation in abduction. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 11 mm per hour\\, and the C-reactive protein level was 3.0 mg per liter (reference value\\, <8.0). A presumptive diagnosis of acute left sixth cranial nerve palsy associated with cerebral microvascular disease was considered. Corrective treatment with eye patching was recommended\\, and the double vision resolved over the next 3 weeks. Eight weeks after she had presented to the emergency department of the second hospital\\, the patient presented to the emergency department of a third hospital because similar symptoms had developed in her right eye. She reported having headache with retro-orbital pain on the right side over the past 3 days\\, accompanied by changes in her color vision and occasional floaters. The physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of 159/66 mm Hg and an abduction deficit of the right eye. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 17 mm per hour (reference range\\, 0 to 30)\\, and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was 1.64 mg per liter (reference value\\, <3.00). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes\\, albumin\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, and total bilirubin were normal\\, as were the results of tests of kidney function. A screening test for Lyme disease antibodies was negative. Dr. Jeremy N. Ford: Cross-sectional imaging of the head and orbits had been performed at the first hospital\\, and the results were reinterpreted at the third hospital. CT of the head (Figure 1A and 1B) reportedly showed stranding of the intraconal fat in the right orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography of the head\\, neck\\, and orbits (performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material) reportedly showed abnormal enhancement and edema of the optic nerve and surrounding tissue on the right side. On my directed review of the MRI (Figure 1C through 1F)\\, I found that the mild edema and enhancement predominantly involved the optic-nerve sheath and intraconal fat\\, which confirmed the findings on CT of the head. The optic nerve itself was largely spared. The temporomandibular joints were partially visible\\, and there was mild periarticular edema and enhancement of the left joint. On T2-weighted imaging\\, scattered hyperintense foci were seen in the periventricular and subcortical white matter\\, a nonspecific finding most likely attributable to chronic small-vessel disease. FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies. Dr. Walton: Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered\\, and the patient was transferred to the neurology unit of this hospital. On evaluation\\, she reported persistent double vision and pain on right lateral gaze but resolution of the retro-orbital headache. She also reported a recent mild flare of an erythematous\\, annular rash\\, as well as recent hair thinning and long-standing Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Review of systems was negative for fever\\, night sweats\\, weight loss\\, joint erythema or swelling\\, muscle stiffness or pain\\, scalp or temple tenderness\\, jaw claudication\\, recurrent sinusitis\\, nasal crusting\\, epistaxis\\, cough\\, hoarseness\\, cough or shortness of breath\\, hemoptysis\\, dry mouth or dry eyes\\, oral ulcers\\, ptosis\\, dysphagia\\, dysarthria\\, hearing changes\\, paresthesia\\, weakness in the arms and legs\\, or changes in the nails. There were no gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms. The patient had a remote history of Graves\u2019 disease with orbitopathy that had been diagnosed and treated more than two decades before this presentation. The medical history was also notable for hypothyroidism\\, hypertension\\, hyperlipidemia\\, gastroesophageal reflux disease\\, cholecystectomy\\, ovary-sparing hysterectomy\\, and lumpectomy for estrogen receptor\u2013positive\\, progesterone receptor\u2013positive breast cancer. A surveillance mammogram obtained in the previous month had reportedly been normal. She had received three vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Medications included atorvastatin\\, amlodipine\\, levothyroxine\\, and tamoxifen. A rash had occurred after the previous use of hydrochlorothiazide. She was married and lived in coastal Massachusetts. She drank wine rarely and did not use tobacco or other substances. Her family history was notable for a maternal aunt with thyroid disease and a child with vitiligo. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C\\, the pulse 68 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 173/72 mm Hg\\, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A few scattered erythematous macules were present on the abdomen\\, including a well-healed punch-biopsy site. A few telangiectasias were observed on the face. There was no rash on the face or scalp\\, and no sclerodactyly was observed. The hair was normal in pattern and distribution. There was no conjunctival injection. Extraocular movements were normal except for abduction of the right eye\\, which was limited and caused pain. There was no proptosis or lid lag. Visual acuity was 20/25 in the left eye and 20/40 with red color desaturation in the right eye. The right optic disk appeared pale as compared with the left optic disk. The remainder of the general and neurologic examination was normal. An electrocardiogram was normal. The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes\\, calcium\\, albumin\\, and globulin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 6 mm per hour\\, and the C-reactive protein level was 0.6 mg per liter. Screening tests for antibodies to hepatitis B virus core antigen\\, hepatitis C virus\\, histone\\, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative\\, as were tests for Lyme disease antibodies\\, syphilis antibodies\\, rheumatoid factor\\, and varicella\u2013zoster virus IgM; varicella\u2013zoster virus IgG was detected. A test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA\\, an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\, and serum and urine toxicology screens were also negative. A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear\\, with an opening pressure of 14 cm of water. Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF showed rare mononuclear cells and no organisms. The CSF glucose level was 86 mg per deciliter (4.8 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter])\\, and the CSF protein level was 30 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 5 to 55). There were no nucleated cells present. On the second day\\, testing for antibodies to bartonella was negative. The levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme\\, C3\\, and C4 were normal\\, as were the results of serum free light-chain testing\\, serum protein electrophoresis\\, and urinalysis. The IgG4 level was 137.3 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 3.9 to 86.4); the levels of other IgG subclasses were normal. Testing for lupus anticoagulant\\, anticardiolipin antibodies\\, and \u03b22-glycoprotein 1 antibodies was negative\\, as was CSF testing for cryptococcal antigen and varicella\u2013zoster virus IgM. Dr. Ford: CT of the chest\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, showed no lymphadenopathy; there was hepatic steatosis and a 2-mm right apical nodule. MRI of the head and whole spine\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, showed asymmetric enhancement surrounding the intraorbital and intracanalicular segments of the right optic-nerve sheath and intraconal fat. No abnormal spinal cord enhancement was observed. Ultrasonography of the temporal arteries showed no halo sign. Dr. Walton: A diagnostic test was performed.,Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody\u2013associated vasculitis."

Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1A) revealed nonspecific mild white-matter changes\\, a nonspecific small focal calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter\\, atherosclerosis without high-grade cerebrovascular stenosis\\, and multilevel spondylotic changes without severe spinal canal stenosis. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarction. CT angiography of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis (Figure 1B and 1C) revealed no evidence of aortic dissection\\, pulmonary embolism\\, pneumothorax\\, pulmonary edema\\, lung consolidation\\, or pericardial effusion. There was a left adrenal nodule that measured 19 mm in diameter\\, a finding consistent with an adenoma. FIGURE 1  Initial Imaging Studies. Dr. Karandinos: Normal saline with 5% dextrose was administered intravenously. During the next 8 hours\\, the patient was agitated and combative. He repeatedly removed peripheral intravenous catheters and disconnected monitors. He was no longer oriented to place or time. Two doses of olanzapine were administered intravenously\\, and the patient slept for several hours during the night. Sixteen hours after the patient arrived in the emergency department\\, the temporal temperature was 37.7\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 78 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 160/72 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The patient was observed to be breathing deeply. He was able to state his name\\, but his speech was otherwise nonsensical and dysarthric. He followed commands only when visual cues were given; for example\\, he stuck out his tongue after the examiner demonstrated the task. Motor\\, sensory\\, and reflex examinations were normal; tests of cerebellar function were not performed. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The results of electroencephalography (EEG) were normal\\, without epileptiform abnormalities. Normal saline with potassium chloride was administered intravenously\\, as was lorazepam. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Applewhite: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2) revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute or subacute infarction. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed a mild burden of white-matter signal hyperintensities\\, which are nonspecific but typical of chronic small-vessel disease. The previously detected calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter correlated with an 8-mm focus of T1 and T2 signal abnormalities with associated susceptibility blooming\\, a finding suggestive of either a calcified cavernous malformation or sequelae of previous infection or inflammation. FIGURE 2  MRI of the Head. Dr. Karandinos: The patient\u2019s mental status did not improve. Twenty-four hours after he arrived in the emergency department\\, he was admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of seizure. The temporal temperature was 37.6\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 77 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 151/70 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. Respiratory effort appeared increased. He was somnolent\\, and he followed simple commands but did not open his eyes in response to sternal rub. The blood levels of creatine kinase\\, fibrinogen\\, and ammonia were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Thiamine was administered intravenously. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.,Chronic salicylate toxicity."

    "ground_truth_output": "weight loss\\, and new pulmonary nodules. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 week before this admission\\, when severe fatigue and generalized weakness developed. He had lost 4.5 kg in the past month after making healthier dietary choices; however\\, he had also noticed abdominal discomfort and a decrease in appetite. During the next week\\, the patient was able to eat and drink very little and lost an additional 4.5 kg. The fatigue and weakness worsened\\, and he mostly stayed in bed. He had several episodes of lightheadedness\\, gait instability\\, and falls while he was walking to the bathroom. There was new odynophagia\\, dysphagia\\, and nausea. On the day of admission\\, the patient was evaluated at the transplant nephrology clinic of this hospital before a scheduled infusion of belatacept. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 70/50 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 98 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared cachectic and lethargic. He was transported by ambulance from the clinic to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department\\, the patient reported malaise and feeling like he had no energy or strength. The lightheadedness and gait instability persisted. A review of systems was notable for shortness of breath\\, dark urine\\, and continued anorexia\\, nausea\\, odynophagia\\, dysphagia\\, and abdominal discomfort. He reported no chills\\, night sweats\\, cough\\, chest pain\\, vomiting\\, hematochezia\\, melena\\, or dysuria. The patient had a history of sarcoidosis. Nine years before this admission\\, nephrocalcinosis caused end-stage kidney disease. Hemodialysis was started\\, and this treatment was continued until a deceased-donor kidney transplantation was performed 7 months before this admission. Routine serologic testing performed before transplantation was positive for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) IgG and cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Serologic testing in the donor was also positive for EBV IgG but was negative for CMV IgG. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin was initiated; maintenance therapy included prednisone\\, mycophenolate mofetil\\, and tacrolimus. Six months before the current admission\\, pathological examination of a biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed vascular disease of donor origin and acute tubular injury but no evidence of T-cell\u2013mediated or antibody-mediated rejection. Treatment with tacrolimus was stopped and belatacept started; prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil therapy was continued. One month before the current admission\\, pathological examination of another biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed focal infiltrates that were vaguely granulomatous and were associated with ruptured tubules and interstitial Tamm\u2013Horsfall protein (also known as uromodulin). There was no evidence of allograft rejection. Two weeks before the current admission\\, laboratory tests revealed a blood creatinine level of 2.31 mg per deciliter (204.2 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range\\, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53.0 to 132.6 \u03bcmol per liter]); routine laboratory tests had revealed similar creatinine levels during the previous 6 months.

There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his mother in an urban area of New England and had never traveled outside the region. He worked as an administrator and had never been homeless or incarcerated. He had no sexual partners and did not smoke tobacco\\, use illicit drugs\\, or drink alcohol. On the day of evaluation in the emergency department\\, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 100 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.5. The patient was lethargic and spoke in sentences of three or four words. The mucous membranes were dry\\, and the throat could not be evaluated because of nausea. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Auscultation of the lungs revealed diffuse inspiratory crackles. Neurologic examination was limited but was notable for 4/5 motor strength in the arms and legs. The blood level of creatinine was 5.05 mg per deciliter (446.4 \u03bcmol per liter)\\, the calcium level 13.1 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter])\\, the lactic acid level 4.4 mmol per liter (39.6 mg per deciliter; reference range\\, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18.0 mg per deciliter])\\, and the hemoglobin level 6.6 g per deciliter (reference range\\, 13.5 to 17.5). Cultures of blood were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Mark C. Murphy: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the chest (Figure 1) revealed innumerable bilateral miliary pulmonary nodules that were new relative to a CT scan that had been obtained 6 months earlier. The nodules were in a random distribution that was suggestive of a hematogenous origin. Trace bilateral pleural effusions were present\\, as was calcified mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy; the lymphadenopathy appeared unchanged from previous imaging. CT of the spleen (Figure 2) revealed new splenomegaly. There was new mild dilatation of the renal collecting system of the transplanted kidney in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies of the Chest Obtained on Admission. FIGURE 2  CT of the Abdomen and Spleen. Dr. Lee: While the patient was being evaluated in the emergency department\\, the temperature increased to 39.6\u00b0C. Intravenous fluids and intravenous infusion of phenylephrine were administered. Empirical treatment with vancomycin\\, cefepime\\, metronidazole\\, levofloxacin\\, doxycycline\\, and micafungin was started; trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and valganciclovir were continued. Treatment with prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued\\, and hydrocortisone therapy was started. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Within 24 hours after admission\\, the oxygen saturation had decreased to 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air; supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation increased to 94%. Continuous intravenous infusion of phenylephrine was continued\\, and norepinephrine was added to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mm Hg. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The creatinine level decreased to 3.82 mg per deciliter (337.7 \u03bcmol per liter)\\, the lactic acid level to 1.6 mmol per liter (14.4 mg per deciliter)\\, and the calcium level to 8.9 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter).

Benavidez: An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 100 beats per minute (Figure 1). ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were present in leads I and II and the lateral precordial leads. There was no atrial or ventricular ectopy. FIGURE 1  Electrocardiographic Studies. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular volume and systolic function\\, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63%; there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal. There was no mitral valve prolapse\\, but mild mitral regurgitation was present. The aortic dimensions were within normal limits\\, and there was no pericardial effusion. Doppler imaging revealed normal systolic and diastolic velocities. Dr. Wolf: Three hours after arrival\\, the patient was transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission\\, he reported that he had intentionally lost 45 kg of weight during the previous year. He took no medications\\, herbal remedies\\, or nutritional supplements and had no known allergies. His immunizations were reportedly current. The patient lived with his mother and younger brother. He played sports; he had no known exposure to sick persons and was not sexually active. He did not smoke tobacco\\, drink alcohol\\, or use illicit drugs. His mother had hypertension\\, unspecified heart disease\\, and a history of recurrent miscarriages. A brother had died at 56 days of age from sudden infant death syndrome. His maternal grandmother had hypertension and diabetes\\, and a maternal aunt had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with nephritis. On examination\\, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 37.6\u00b0C\\, the pulse 111 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 148/72 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The fingers were cold and pale. Examination of the skin revealed striae on the abdomen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Tests for influenza virus\\, respiratory syncytial virus\\, parainfluenza virus\\, adenovirus\\, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.031\\, a pH of 6.0\\, and 1+ protein. Intravenous fluids\\, ibuprofen\\, and famotidine were administered\\, and supplemental oxygen was discontinued. During the next 24 hours\\, the chest pain and ECG abnormalities abated and the blood levels of creatine kinase\\, troponin T\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, and aspartate aminotransferase decreased. The patient was discharged home; he was advised to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for pain\\, and a follow-up appointment with a pediatric cardiologist was scheduled. Ten days later\\, in the cardiology clinic\\, the patient reported that the chest pain had resolved. He appeared well. The pulse was 86 beats per minute and the blood pressure 151/77 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Results of laboratory tests performed in the patient\u2019s primary care clinic 3 days earlier are shown in Table 1. ECG was performed. Dr. Benavidez: An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 82 beats per minute (Figure 1). There were nonspecific ST-segment changes in leads III and aVF; ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were no longer present. Dr. Wolf: Ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys was normal. Amlodipine was prescribed\\, and follow-up appointments with a pediatric nephrologist and a medical geneticist were scheduled but not kept by the patient. Results of laboratory tests performed in the primary care clinic 6 weeks after discharge are shown in Table 1. Approximately 9.5 months after admission to the pediatric ICU\\, the patient presented to the emergency department of the other hospital with a 15-hour history of fever\\, malaise\\, nausea\\, vomiting\\, diarrhea\\, midsternal chest pain\\, and lightheadedness. He rated the chest pain at 6 out of 10. The temperature was 39.3\u00b0C\\, the pulse 119 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 134/61 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. On examination\\, the capillary refill time in the fingers was 3 to 4 seconds. ECG and imaging studies were performed. Dr. Benavidez: An ECG showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 126 beats per minute (Figure 1). There were frequent premature atrial and ventricular contractions\\, along with diffuse flattening of T waves. Dr. Sjirk J. Westra: Frontal and lateral chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly\\, as characterized by an increased cardiothoracic ratio\\, with predominant enlargement of the left atrium (Figure 2). Pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial pulmonary edema and a small left pleural effusion were detected; these findings are suggestive of congestive heart failure. FIGURE 2  Chest Images Obtained 9.5 Months after First Admission. Dr. Wolf: The patient was again transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission\\, he reported that the chest pain had abated. He appeared to be in no distress. The temperature was 38.8\u00b0C\\, the pulse 134 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 129/49 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg. On auscultation of the heart\\, the rhythm was irregular; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.027\\, a pH of 5.0\\, and 1+ protein. Intravenous fluids\\, magnesium sulfate\\, sodium phosphate\\, amlodipine\\, famotidine\\, ondansetron\\, acetaminophen\\, and ibuprofen were administered. During the next 2 days\\, fever and intermittent chest pain persisted and hypertension developed\\, with blood-pressure measurements as high as 187/97 mm Hg. Hydralazine and labetalol were administered\\, and the dose of amlodipine was increased. On examination\\, strength in the proximal muscles of the arms and legs was graded as 4 out of 5\\, with 5 indicating normal muscular contraction against full resistance. There were episodes during which the fingers were cold and pale; no nailfold capillary abnormalities were seen. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. The blood level of troponin T decreased to 0.57 ng per milliliter and the blood level of creatine kinase MB isoenzyme decreased to 50.2 ng per milliliter\\, whereas the blood level of creatine kinase increased to 8336 U per liter; the urine level of myoglobin was 283 \u03bcg per liter (reference value\\, \u226421). The results of thyroid-function tests were normal. Some peripheral blood glucose measurements\\, obtained by fingerstick testing\\, were as low as 22 mg per deciliter (1.2 mmol per liter)\\, despite a regular diet and the administration of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids. These values were not verified by concurrent central venous blood glucose measurements. Additional test results were received\\, and a diagnosis was made.,Undifferentiated autoimmune rheumatic disease."

    "ground_truth_output": "the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital because of a transient episode of gross hematuria. Urinalysis showed trace blood (reference value\\, negative)\\, and microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed 4 or 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range\\, 0 to 3). Results of tests of coagulation were normal\\, and the complete blood count showed anemia\\, which had been diagnosed previously and was stable as compared with findings obtained 11 months earlier. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, reportedly showed a linear density in the bladder that measured 10 mm in diameter. The cause of the episode of hematuria was thought to be a kidney stone that had passed into the bladder. The patient was discharged home with a plan to follow up in the urology clinic affiliated with the other hospital; he was instructed to continue treatment with rivaroxaban\\, which he had been taking for many years to prevent stroke in the context of atrial fibrillation. One week before the current presentation\\, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of the other hospital after he had expressive aphasia as well as numbness on the right side of his face and in his right arm\\, which had resolved before he arrived at the emergency department. He had missed multiple doses of rivaroxaban in the 2 weeks before the onset of these symptoms. CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly did not show evidence of stroke or clinically significant stenosis in the anterior or posterior cerebral circulation. The complete blood count showed that his anemia remained stable. The blood levels of electrolytes\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, and alkaline phosphatase were normal\\, as were the results of tests of coagulation and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

On hospital day 2\\, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, reportedly showed moderate generalized atrophy and small-vessel ischemic changes. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%\\, increased estimated right ventricular systolic pressure\\, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation\\, mild aortic regurgitation\\, moderate tricuspid regurgitation\\, and intact intraventricular and atrial septa. The patient was told that his symptoms were due to a transient ischemic attack\\, and he was discharged home with instructions to continue taking rivaroxaban and with a plan to follow up in the neurology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. On the day of the current presentation\\, the patient fell in his bathroom at his home. Emergency medical services were called. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 130 mg per deciliter (7.2 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 70 to 100 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). The patient was not able to recall the events that led to the fall. He was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department\\, the patient reported that he had felt unwell after discharge from the other hospital\\, with symptoms including generalized weakness and dizziness. He had no abdominal pain\\, chest pain\\, or urinary symptoms. His wife reported that before the patient\u2019s admission to the other hospital\\, he had been completely independent\\, performing activities such as driving and grocery shopping. However\\, since his discharge from the other hospital\\, he had become progressively weaker and had required assistance with walking and dressing. The patient\u2019s wife also reported an area of redness on the patient\u2019s left arm where an intravenous catheter had been placed during admission to the other hospital. Other medical history included atrial fibrillation\\, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction\\, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\\, depression\\, hypertension\\, and prostate cancer that had been treated with radiotherapy. Medications included amlodipine\\, finasteride\\, furosemide\\, losartan\\, rivaroxaban\\, rosuvastatin\\, and venlafaxine. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs; he smoked one pack of cigarettes per day. He was retired and lived in Massachusetts with his wife. The temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 145/68 mm Hg\\, the pulse 61 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.4. The patient appeared ill with dry mucous membranes. The heart sounds were irregular. There was an area of erythema overlying the left antecubital fossa with mild induration but no fluctuance. He had an abrasion over the left knee. He was cooperative but confused and intermittently answered questions inappropriately; he occasionally stared off into space and did not respond to questions. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, alkaline phosphatase\\, and lactate were normal\\, as were the results of tests of coagulation. Urinalysis showed 3+ blood (reference value\\, negative) and 3+ leukocyte esterase (reference value\\, negative); microscopic evaluation of the urinary sediment revealed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field (reference range\\, 0 to 2)\\, more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value\\, <10)\\, and 1+ bacteria. The blood level of creatinine was 2.01 mg per deciliter (178 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range\\, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and the blood level of high-sensitivity troponin T 68 ng per liter (reference range\\, 0 to 14); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for respiratory viruses\\, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\\, were negative. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Brian B. Ghoshhajra: CT angiography of the head and cervical spine showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of an acute infarct and no acute fracture in the cervical spine. CT angiography of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis was also performed. A small pleural effusion was detected in the left lung (Figure 1A). Moderate-to-severe coronary-artery calcification with multichamber cardiomegaly was present\\, and calcifications were scattered throughout the thoracic aorta\\, which showed aneurysmal dilatation (Figure 1D). An indeterminate left adrenal nodule that measured 15 mm in diameter was detected\\, along with circumferential wall thickening in the urinary bladder and two stones in the urinary bladder that measured up to 5 mm in diameter; seeds from previous brachytherapy were also visible (Figure 1C). Two focal areas of hyperdensity\\, each measuring up to 6 mm in diameter\\, that were seen along the posterior aspect of the spinal canal at the level of the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae were most likely meningiomas (Figure 1A and 1B). There was a focal outpouching of the aorta superior to the origin of the celiac artery and mural thickening of the aorta at the level of the aortic hiatus with adjacent fat stranding (Figure 1D). FIGURE 1  Initial CT Angiogram of the Chest\\, Abdomen\\, and Pelvis. Dr. McFadden: While the patient was in the emergency department\\, the high-sensitivity troponin T levels\\, which were checked 1 and 3 hours after the initial troponin measurement\\, were 71 ng per liter and 70 ng per liter\\, respectively. A bolus of 500 ml of normal saline was administered. A presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection was made\\, and urine was obtained for culture. Treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was initiated\\, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with furosemide and losartan was stopped\\, but his other home medications were continued. On hospital day 1\\, the urine culture grew more than 100\\,000 colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus. MRI of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, was degraded by motion artifact\\, but there was no evidence of an acute infarct. A TTE showed an LVEF of 60%\\, a dilated right ventricle with normal systolic function\\, mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation\\, mild mitral regurgitation\\, severe tricuspid regurgitation\\, and an elevated estimated right ventricular systolic pressure. Blood was obtained for culture\\, and treatment with ceftriaxone was continued. On hospital day 2\\, the patient remained afebrile. An ultrasound image of the left antecubital fossa showed an avascular hypoechoic collection\\, measuring 1.7 cm by 0.5 cm by 1.3 cm\\, overlying a partially occluded superficial vein. The patient was evaluated by the orthopedic surgery consultant; no surgical intervention was recommended. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the urine culture isolate revealed methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Treatment with ceftriaxone was stopped\\, and treatment with intravenous vancomycin and cefazolin was initiated. Blood cultures obtained on hospital day 1 grew gram-positive cocci in clusters in one of four bottles. Additional blood cultures were obtained. On hospital day 3\\, the patient had sudden chest pain while resting in bed. The pain was located over the left third intercostal space and did not radiate; the patient rated the pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain lasted 5 minutes and resolved without intervention. On evaluation by the treating physician immediately after the pain resolved\\, the blood pressure was 193/80 mm Hg. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes. A chest radiograph showed a small left pleural effusion similar to that previously seen on CT angiography and a confluent retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe. The blood level of high-sensitivity troponin T was 46 ng per liter. Treatment with losartan\\, which had been stopped on admission to the hospital\\, was restarted. During the next 12 hours\\, the blood pressure decreased to 167/81 mm Hg. On hospital day 4\\, the patient had chest pain that was different in character from the pain he had had the previous day. The pain\\, which he rated at 10\\, radiated into the abdomen. The patient appeared distressed. The blood pressure was 173/85 mm Hg. The pain was unchanged on palpation over the chest and abdomen. Treatment with low-dose intravenous hydromorphone was initiated\\, and the pain decreased to 5 out of 10. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed\\, and management decisions were made.,Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and infectious aortic pseudoaneurysm."

Once the patient had 1 day without recurrent fever after the antipyretic medications had been stopped\\, treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was resumed. Two weeks before the current admission\\, fever recurred. The patient was evaluated at the other hospital. The blood levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\\, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)\\, bilirubin\\, and alkaline phosphatase were normal\\, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of kidney function. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again stopped\\, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was started. Fever and nausea resolved after 1 day\\, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was stopped. Once the patient had 1 day without recurrent fever after the antipyretic medications had been stopped\\, treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again resumed. Four days before the current admission\\, fever recurred. The patient was again evaluated at the other hospital. Results of liver tests and kidney-function tests were again normal\\, as was the complete blood count. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again stopped\\, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was initiated. Daily fevers persisted for 4 days\\, and the patient was advised to present to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On evaluation\\, the patient reported fatigue that had started 1 month earlier and had gradually increased in severity\\, as well as light-headedness when standing from a seated position. She also reported intermittent vomiting\\, loose stools\\, and pain in the right upper quadrant that increased after eating but no diarrhea or dysuria. She had a dry cough without shortness of breath. Other medical history included carpal tunnel syndrome that had been treated with carpal tunnel release surgery. The patient had no known drug allergies. She worked as a nurse and lived with her husband and two adult children in a coastal region of New England. She did not drink alcohol\\, smoke cigarettes\\, or use illicit drugs. Her father had hyperthyroidism; her mother had hypertension\\, diabetes mellitus\\, and cerebrovascular disease. The temporal temperature was 40.2\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 85/53 mm Hg\\, the pulse 108 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was diaphoretic and appeared ill. The mucous membranes were moist\\, and no lesions were present in the oropharynx. The heart sounds were regular\\, with no murmurs\\, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. There was mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No rash was present. The white-cell count was 5190 per microliter (reference range\\, 4500 to 11\\,000); 20% of the cells were bands (reference range\\, 0 to 10)\\, and 10% were metamyelocytes (reference value\\, 0). The platelet count was 87\\,000 per microliter (reference range\\, 150\\,000 to 400\\,000). The blood level of creatinine was 2.73 mg per deciliter (241 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range\\, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter])\\, AST 190 U per liter (reference range\\, 9 to 32)\\, ALT 62 U per liter (reference range\\, 7 to 33)\\, and alkaline phosphatase 173 U per liter (reference range\\, 30 to 100). Tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for adenovirus\\, human rhinovirus and enterovirus\\, influenza virus types A and B\\, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4\\, respiratory syncytial virus\\, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were negative. A blood specimen was obtained for culture. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Jiyoon Kang: Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant (Figure 1A and 1B) revealed cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis or biliary ductal dilatation. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis (Figure 1C through 1F)\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed findings suggestive of hepatic steatosis\\, pulmonary edema\\, small bilateral pleural effusions\\, subsegmental linear atelectasis\\, and bilateral lung nodules that were similar in appearance to those seen on staging CT performed 1 month earlier. FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies of the Abdomen\\, Pelvis\\, and Chest. Dr. Meizlish: Intravenous fluids were administered\\, and the blood pressure improved; empirical treatment with vancomycin\\, cefepime\\, metronidazole\\, and azithromycin was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital. On hospital day 2\\, fever and nausea resolved. There was no vomiting or loose stools. However\\, pain in the right upper quadrant had worsened. On hospital day 3\\, blood cultures were without growth\\, and treatment with vancomycin\\, cefepime\\, metronidazole\\, and azithromycin was discontinued. The patient remained afebrile. On hospital day 5\\, the blood level of AST was 407 U per liter\\, ALT 138 U per liter\\, and alkaline phosphatase 510 U per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed.,BRAF\u2013MEK inhibitor\u2013related toxic effects."

    "ground_truth_output": "Newton\u2013Wellesley Hospital\\, Newton\\, MA): A 54-year-old man was evaluated by the neuropsychology service of this hospital because of irritability\\, confusion\\, and odd behaviors. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before the current evaluation\\, when he received a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue that had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. He underwent surgical dissection of the neck and resection of the tongue base on the right side\\, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy\\, which resulted in cancer remission. After treatment\\, neck pain and shoulder weakness developed and was attributed to postoperative neuropathy involving the right spinal accessory nerve. In the context of this illness and persistent pain\\, the patient sought care at the cancer center behavioral medicine clinic of this hospital and received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. During the next 8 months\\, the patient was seen for psychotherapy approximately every 2 weeks. Treatment for the pain included physical therapy\\, occupational therapy\\, massage therapy\\, acupuncture\\, trigger-point injections\\, and the use of a scapular elevation brace. Therapy with oxycodone\\, methadone\\, gabapentin\\, tizanidine\\, and duloxetine was started. Four months before the current evaluation\\, a sural nerve graft was placed in the right spinal accessory nerve from the proximal\\, functioning portion to the distal portion\\, but the pain and weakness did not abate. Six weeks before the current evaluation\\, the patient did not respond to telephone calls for 24 hours. The police were called and found the patient unresponsive with prescription medication bottles nearby. Emergency medical services personnel arrived\\, and the initial evaluation\\, in the patient\u2019s home\\, was notable for a severely decreased respiratory rate. Naloxone was administered\\, the trachea was intubated\\, and the patient was taken to a local hospital. In the emergency department\\, the patient was pulseless with ongoing electrocardiographic activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed\\, and epinephrine was administered; after 4 minutes\\, spontaneous circulation was restored. The dose of methadone was decreased\\, and therapy with oxycodone\\, gabapentin\\, and tizanidine was stopped. During the subsequent 6 days\\, septic shock\\, aspiration pneumonia\\, acute kidney injury\\, and delirium occurred. When these problems resolved\\, the patient was discharged home. Five weeks before the current evaluation\\, the patient participated in a video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic. He expressed embarrassment and frustration related to his apparent accidental overdose. He described persistent depression\\, increased anxiety\\, and no other new symptoms. Two weeks before the current evaluation\\, the patient missed a routine video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic\\, and his family was called. For the preceding 2 weeks\\, they had noticed that the patient was uncharacteristically agitated\\, irritable\\, talking loudly\\, and verbally abusive. Odd behaviors were reported. The patient had gotten lost while driving to a friend\u2019s house that he visited frequently\\, had been pulled over by police for driving erratically (with normal results on a breathalyzer test)\\, and on another occasion\\, had been found walking along the highway under an overpass. He called family members repeatedly in the middle of the night\\, and he would not answer when the calls were returned. When the family requested a police wellness check of the patient\\, the patient retaliated by requesting a police wellness check of the family members. After this incident\\, the family was advised to take the patient to a local hospital for admission. At the local hospital\\, the patient reported no symptoms and noted that he had stopped taking methadone because he was concerned about a medication overdose. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 19\\, indicating cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30\\, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.1 Computed tomography (CT) of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a nonspecific hypodensity in the centrum semiovale on the left side. The patient was told he had mild dementia. Visiting nurse services were arranged\\, and the patient was discharged home. One week before the current evaluation\\, the patient\u2019s family reported that he had increased confusion and odd behaviors. He was unable to recall details of conversations that had happened minutes before. He could not operate the telephone or remote control and had emptied the trash can into the toilet. He had asked for his clothes to be cut off because he felt uncomfortable. Family members had been staying with the patient every night since his recent discharge because they were concerned about his safety. A neuropsychological evaluation was requested. Dr. Michael W. Parsons: The evaluation was conducted by the cancer center neuropsychology service of this hospital with the use of videoconferencing technology to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient acknowledged only minimal cognitive changes and was dismissive of the family\u2019s concerns. A review of systems was notable for fatigue\\, moderate depression\\, mild anxiety\\, and difficulty sleeping and keeping track of time. Additional history obtained from the patient\u2019s family included insomnia\\, lumbar disk herniation\\, olecranon bursitis\\, and an inguinal hernia that had led to surgical repair in early adulthood. He had had multiple concussions as a teenager\\, as well as a brief loss of consciousness during a motor vehicle collision 3 years earlier. After the collision\\, fatigue\\, headaches\\, difficulty concentrating\\, and impaired memory occurred; during the subsequent 2 years\\, occupational therapy was provided\\, and the symptoms gradually resolved. Medications at the time of evaluation included ibuprofen\\, acetaminophen\\, duloxetine\\, trazodone\\, melatonin\\, polyethylene glycol\\, and multivitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England with family members nearby. He had completed a master\u2019s degree and had had a successful career; he had taken a leave of absence from work 9 months earlier in anticipation of cancer treatment. After cancer treatment\\, he had been unable to return to work because of pain. He was athletic\\, walked 3 miles daily\\, and enjoyed golfing. He rarely drank alcohol and had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs. His family history included breast cancer and dementia in his mother\\, hearing loss and hypertension in his father\\, metastatic cancer with an unknown primary source in his paternal grandfather\\, glaucoma and alcohol use disorder in his maternal grandmother\\, and a brain tumor in a more distant relative. On video neuropsychological examination\\, the patient was in no distress and was adequately groomed\\, with normal-appearing hygiene. His affect was irritable\\, and the fact that he reported no symptoms suggested limited insight. His spontaneous speech was fluent and well articulated. His thoughts were tangential\\, and he was frequently forgetful and easily distracted; his information processing speed was slow. A formal neuropsychological assessment revealed impaired executive functioning\\, marked by disinhibition and poor working memory\\, as well as deficits in recent memory\\, verbal fluency\\, and information processing speed. Dr. Bullis: A diagnostic test was performed.,Delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy."

Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The result of testing for group B streptococcus colonization was not available; empirical treatment with vancomycin was administered. Spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred\\, resulting in clear\\, odorless fluid. Eight hours later\\, the patient vaginally delivered a male infant and an intact placenta. She had lost an estimated 300 ml of blood\\, and she had a second-degree perineal laceration\\, which was repaired. The baby was large for gestational age\\, weighing 3575 g. On the second postpartum day\\, the patient was discharged home. During the subsequent 4 days\\, the patient pumped breast milk and visited her baby in the special care nursery of this hospital daily while he was being treated for prematurity and feeding difficulties. She had mild diffuse abdominal and pelvic cramping and vaginal bleeding with occasional clots. On the day of the current admission\\, fever and chills developed\\, and the patient returned to the emergency department of this hospital. Review of systems was notable for small\\, painful bumps in the inguinal area on both sides that had developed during pregnancy and had intermittently drained blood and pus. She also had leg swelling that had abated since childbirth. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 38.7\u00b0C and the blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg. The lungs were clear on auscultation\\, the breasts nontender\\, the uterine fundus mildly tender\\, and the legs mildly swollen. Tender\\, erythematous pustules that drained yellow\\, purulent fluid were present in the inguinal area on the right side; scarring was present in the inguinal area on the left side. The repaired perineal laceration was healing well. The white-cell count was 22\\,940 per microliter (reference range\\, 4500 to 11\\,000). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and cervical cultures were obtained. The patient had rosacea\\, acne\\, and hidradenitis suppurativa. Episodes of diverticulitis had occurred 5 years and 2 years before this admission\\, and an episode of epiploic appendagitis had occurred 10 weeks before this admission. She was taking prenatal vitamins\\, topical azelaic acid\\, and acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for abdominal pain. Amoxicillin and cephalexin had caused hives. She worked as an educator and lived with her husband and dog in a suburban area of New England. She did not vape or smoke cigarettes\\, drink alcohol\\, or use illicit drugs. Her father and paternal grandfather had arthritis that had been diagnosed in early adulthood\\, her brother had Crohn\u2019s disease\\, and another brother had neurofibromatosis. Her mother was healthy. Dr. Rory L. Cochran: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, showed normal postpartum uterine enlargement\\, with mild adjacent fat stranding. Dr. Siegel: Empirical treatment with gentamicin and clindamycin was started. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of endometritis. Fever\\, abdominal pain\\, and leukocytosis did not abate\\, and vancomycin was added on hospital day 3. A test dose of cefepime was administered on hospital day 4. When the patient did not have an allergic reaction to the test dose\\, gentamicin and clindamycin were stopped\\, and she was treated with vancomycin\\, cefepime\\, and metronidazole. Dr. Melanie C. Kwan: On hospital day 6\\, an endometrial biopsy was performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed neutrophilic debris that included fragments of stroma with a dense neutrophilic infiltrate. Dr. Cochran: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography of the pelvis\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, showed mild ascites (Figure 1A) and anasarca (Figure 1B). No evidence of retained products of conception\\, fluid collections\\, or venous or arterial thromboses was observed. Four days later\\, magnetic resonance angiography of the pelvis revealed increased ascites and anasarca\\, as well as two new fluid collections: a peripherally enhancing left parametrial collection that measured 6.3 cm in largest dimension (Figure 1C) and a collection located near the right uterocervical junction that measured 3.2 cm in largest dimension (Figure 1D). FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Pelvis. Dr. Siegel: Treatment with cefepime and metronidazole was stopped\\, vancomycin was continued\\, and meropenem was started because of ongoing fever. A percutaneous catheter was inserted into the left parametrial fluid collection\\, and 20 ml of purulent fluid was drained; cultures showed no growth. On hospital day 11\\, abdominal pain increased\\, and shortness of breath developed. The oxygen saturation was 86% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation increased to 91%. The temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 109/58 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 112 beats per minute\\, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The patient appeared tired and ill. Marked jugular venous distention was present. The heart sounds were tachycardic and regular\\, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was distended and diffusely tender on palpation\\, and the percutaneous catheter inserted along the midline of the pelvis had scant purulent drainage. Diffuse anasarca and symmetric 1+ ankle edema were present. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal biventricular function; however\\, the right atrium and right ventricle were dilated\\, and the interventricular septum was flattened during diastole. The main pulmonary artery and its branches were also dilated. Dr. Cochran: CT pulmonary angiography showed bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis and no pulmonary embolism. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed increased ascites and anasarca\\, new splenomegaly\\, new hepatomegaly with heterogeneous peripheral enhancement (Figure 1E)\\, and mild periportal edema. The percutaneously drained left parametrial fluid collection had resolved; the fluid collection at the right uterocervical junction remained unchanged. Results of liver-function tests were abnormal\\, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed multiple new intrahepatic fluid collections\\, which were hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging (Figure 1F). Dr. Daniela Kroshinsky: The next day\\, new edematous\\, violaceous\\, friable plaques developed on the left upper arm at the site where a previous peripheral intravenous catheter had been inserted. A new erythematous-to-violaceous bulla on the left abdominal wall also developed. The plaques located on the left arm subsequently ulcerated (Figure 2A)\\, as did new skin lesions located in the right inguinal crease and on the mons pubis. During the next 2 days\\, the bulla located on the left abdominal wall also began to ulcerate\\, and another similar lesion formed around the site where the percutaneous drainage catheter had been inserted. The ulcers involving the left upper arm\\, right inguinal crease\\, and mons pubis increased in area and depth\\, and a new ulcer formed in the left inguinal crease. FIGURE 2  Clinical Photographs of the Lesion on the Left Upper Arm before and after Treatment. Dr. Siegel: Treatment with intravenous furosemide was administered. Vancomycin was stopped\\, meropenem was continued\\, and daptomycin and micafungin were started. A diagnostic test was performed.,Sweet\u2019s syndrome."

In the emergency department\\, the patient reported pain in the left arm that occurred with supination or while she was making a fist. There was no numbness or tingling in the arm or hand or history of hemarthrosis\\, prolonged bleeding with dental procedures\\, or menorrhagia. The medical history was notable for hypertension\\, dyslipidemia\\, peripheral vascular disease\\, carotid artery stenosis\\, osteoporosis\\, chronic kidney disease\\, and obesity\\, as well as an episode of deep venous thrombosis 40 years earlier. Medications included aspirin\\, atorvastatin\\, lisinopril\\, hydrochlorothiazide\\, and metoprolol. The patient had smoked tobacco for 40 years but had quit 22 years earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She was widowed and lived alone but visited with her grown children regularly. Her father had had coronary artery disease. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 169/77 mm Hg\\, the pulse 76 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

There was hyperdense stranding in the subcutaneous fat centered over the elbow and forearm\\, a finding consistent with hemorrhage (Figure 2). CT angiography of the arteries revealed heavy\\, partially calcified plaque throughout the thoracic aorta. Focal heavy plaque in the left subclavian artery proximal to the vertebral artery resulted in approximately 70 to 80% stenosis (Figure 3). The arteries in the left arm were otherwise patent. There were no signs of active hemorrhage on arterial or delayed-phase images or findings that could lead to localization of an arterial injury\\, such as pseudoaneurysm or dissection. In addition\\, an enhancing mass was not identified. The visualized superficial and deep veins were patent on delayed-phase images. FIGURE 2  CT Scan of the Left Arm.

    "ground_truth_output": "suicidal ideation\\, and gait disturbance. The patient had a long history of depressive episodes\\, with two previous hospitalizations for suicide attempts. Approximately two decades before the current admission\\, he was struck on the head with a beam while working at a construction site and had a 4-cm laceration. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital\\, where the wound was sutured but no further evaluation was conducted. Approximately 10 years before the current admission\\, around the time of his mother\u2019s death\\, the patient was evaluated at this hospital because of an episode of irritability\\, a reduced need for sleep\\, and grandiosity; he reported feelings of \u201ctranscendence\u201d and being \u201cat one with God.\u201d He was admitted for 1 month to the psychiatry unit of a second hospital\\, where he was treated with lithium and electroconvulsive therapy. Thereafter\\, he received outpatient psychiatric treatment on a monthly basis\\, as well as therapy with valproic acid and fluoxetine. Approximately 9 years before the current admission\\, the patient fell on concrete stairs and had back pain with subsequent lower-leg weakness and urinary incontinence. He was evaluated at a third hospital\\, where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes\\, including L4\u2013L5 spinal stenosis and central disk protrusion. Acetaminophen and physical therapy were prescribed. Five years later (4 years before the current admission)\\, the patient fell because of an unsteady gait and was evaluated at a fourth hospital. Neurologic examination revealed a memory deficit (with an inability to recall any objects after 5 minutes on the three-item object-recall test) and poor attention (with an inability to perform serial sevens calculations)\\, as well as action tremor in the arms and \u201cmildly unsteady\u201d gait\\, even with the use of a cane. The remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count\\, results of renal function tests\\, and levels of electrolytes\\, valproic acid\\, folate\\, vitamin B12\\, glycated hemoglobin\\, and thyrotropin were normal; serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. MRI of the head reportedly revealed no evidence of an infarct\\, intracranial hemorrhage\\, or a mass but showed mild prominence of ventricles\\, sulci\\, and cisterns. The dose of fluoxetine was decreased\\, and the patient was discharged 3 days later. Additional falls occurred 2 months and 4 months later\\, and both times\\, the patient was evaluated at the fourth hospital. Two months after the most recent fall\\, he hit the car in front of him while driving. His psychiatrist noted that he had bilateral tremor at rest; the dose of valproic acid was reduced\\, and he was referred to a neurologist. Two months after the car crash\\, he fell while walking and was evaluated at the fourth hospital. The evaluation was notable for nystagmus and a normal valproic acid level (89 \u03bcg per milliliter; reference range\\, 50 to 100) despite the dose reduction; the doses of valproic acid and trazodone were reduced\\, and physical therapy was provided. During the next 5 months\\, gait instability was reduced but persisted. The patient was evaluated by two other neurologists after reporting a feeling of \u201cimbalance.\u201d Audiometry revealed mild-to-moderate high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Medications were considered to be a contributor to his balance dysfunction. During the next 12 months\\, the dose of valproic acid was tapered and fluoxetine was stopped; the patient underwent trials of escitalopram and then sertraline for the treatment of depressive symptoms. He reported to his psychiatrist symptoms of confusion\\, some difficulty with memory\\, and decreased leg coordination. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 23 (scores range from 0 to 30\\, with a score of 18 to 25 suggesting mild cognitive impairment). Dr. McKinley Glover: Fifteen months before the current admission\\, the patient began to have dizziness. MRI of the head (Figure 1)\\, performed at this hospital\\, revealed an old infarct in the left corona radiata\\, features of mild small-vessel disease\\, mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss\\, and mild ventricular prominence. FIGURE 1  Initial MRI of the Head. Dr. Luccarelli: Neuropsychiatric testing was performed\\, and the results did not suggest a neurodegenerative process. Given the patient\u2019s progressively depressed mood\\, treatment with aripiprazole was started\\, with the dose adjusted over the following 12 months. Three months before the current admission\\, the patient reported worsening depression\\, with hopelessness\\, guilt\\, and increased sleep. That month\\, his son found him unable to walk and requiring assistance to move. On examination\\, he had tremor and muscle rigidity; on ambulation\\, he had a shuffling gait and required a cane. Treatment with aripiprazole was stopped\\, benztropine was started\\, and sertraline was replaced by fluoxetine. One month before the current admission\\, the patient was voluntarily hospitalized in the psychiatry unit of this hospital because of worsening depression\\, which he attributed to the progressive reduction in mobility and strength. He reported 3 weeks of frequent early morning awakenings\\, anhedonia\\, low energy\\, anorexia\\, difficulty concentrating\\, and low motivation\\, such that he had not paid bills or bathed. Examination was notable for tremor\\, muscle rigidity\\, and a shuffling gait. Blood levels of folate\\, vitamin B12\\, and glycated hemoglobin were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 antibodies and type 1 antigen and for antitreponemal antibodies were negative. Over the 5-day hospitalization\\, the dose of fluoxetine was increased and treatment with lurasidone was started. TABLE 1  Laboratory Data.

His depressive symptoms persisted\\, and after he reported thoughts of suicide and feeling unsafe to his psychiatrist\\, he was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for malaise\\, anorexia\\, poor sleep\\, anhedonia\\, hopelessness\\, guilt\\, low energy\\, worsening gait\\, and chronic joint pain; he reported no recent falls or manic symptoms. The patient\u2019s psychiatric history included bipolar depression with suicide attempts and multiple psychiatric admissions\\, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder\\, and skin picking. His medical history was notable for long-standing urinary incontinence\\, hypertension\\, and sleep apnea; he had undergone laser ablation of the prostate 4 years earlier\\, as well as bilateral inguinal hernia repair and rotator cuff repair. Medications at the time of admission included fluoxetine\\, lurasidone\\, valproic acid\\, aspirin\\, and lisinopril\\, as well as lorazepam and trazodone as needed. Lithium had caused tremor\\, aripiprazole had caused muscle rigidity and tremor\\, and gabapentin had caused grogginess. The patient did not smoke tobacco\\, and he drank alcohol less than once monthly; he had previously smoked marijuana several times daily but had been abstinent for 2 years. He was retired from employment as a laborer. He was divorced and resided in an assisted-living facility. His family history was notable for major depression in his mother and bipolar disorder in one of his children. The temperature was 36.1\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 74 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 110/61 mm Hg\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.5. The patient was wheelchair-bound. He was described as well-groomed and cooperative\\, with appropriate eye contact. He was oriented to time\\, place\\, and person. His speech was fluent and indicated a logical thought process but was considered to be \u201cslow.\u201d Some of his responses seemed slow\\, but naming\\, repetition\\, attention\\, concentration\\, and memory were intact. His mood and affect were described as depressed\\, and he had suicidal ideation. Results of cranial nerve examination were normal\\, except for reduced facial expression. Motor examination showed mildly increased tone in the lower legs and left arm\\, with bradykinesia\\, and was otherwise normal. The gait was described as being \u201cslow to start\u201d with a \u201cmagnetic quality\u201d and then as \u201cshuffling\u201d for a few steps. The remainder of the neurologic and general physical examinations was normal. The white-cell count\\, platelet count\\, and levels of hemoglobin\\, calcium\\, and albumin were normal\\, as were results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Glover: MRI of the head (Figure 2)\\, performed with and without the administration of contrast material\\, revealed the old infarct in the left corona radiata\\, features of mild small-vessel disease\\, and mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss with prominence of the ventricles and sylvian fissures. There was no abnormal enhancement. Coronal reformatted images showed a callosal angle (the angle at which the two lateral ventricles meet at the level of the posterior commissure) of 66 degrees.

A test for Covid-19 was not performed because of limited test availability; tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were not performed because of a statewide shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs. The patient was instructed to quarantine at home. During the next 5 days\\, the patient quarantined in a room in her apartment. Her husband periodically brought food to the door of the room. The fever\\, fatigue\\, sore throat\\, cough\\, and myalgias persisted; new shortness of breath and anosmia developed. She had decreased appetite\\, and she consumed minimal food and drink. One day before this admission\\, nausea\\, vomiting\\, and diarrhea developed\\, and the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. Intravenous fluid\\, ondansetron\\, and ketorolac were administered\\, and she was discharged home with instructions to continue to quarantine. On the day of admission\\, the patient had dizziness while standing\\, as well as shortness of breath\\, and she returned to the urgent care clinic of this hospital. The temperature was 38.7\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 127 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 38 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was anxious and tearful. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Intravenous fluid\\, ondansetron\\, and oral acetaminophen were administered. The dizziness resolved\\, and the fever\\, shortness of breath\\, and anxiety decreased. The patient was advised to return home to quarantine; however\\, she disclosed that if she were sent home\\, she planned to overdose on medications to die by suicide because of her anxiety and feelings of sadness and loneliness. Owing to concern about the patient\u2019s risk of harming herself\\, an order authorizing temporary involuntary hospitalization was implemented. Emergency medical services were called\\, and the patient was brought to the emergency department. On evaluation in the emergency department\\, the patient reported anxiety\\, palpitations\\, and shortness of breath and noted that her anxiety and feelings of isolation and loneliness had developed during quarantine. She also reported poor sleep\\, decreased energy\\, and anhedonia. The patient described that she felt like a burden to her husband and was terrified that she would transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to her children\\, including her 4-year-old son\\, who had been born prematurely and had a congenital pulmonary condition. In addition\\, the patient reported a 1-week history of new\\, recurring nightmares in which she would see herself playing with her own severed body parts; these nightmares occurred more frequently during periods of high fever. She intermittently had the sensation that someone was in the room with her while she was awake\\, even though she was aware that she was alone. She disclosed that\\, on the previous day\\, she had had new suicidal ideation associated with fear of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to her family and that she had taken five aspirin\u2013paracetamol\u2013caffeine pills at once. There had been no history of suicidal ideation or attempt\\, self-harm\\, or homicidal ideation. The patient had a history of depression and panic attacks when she was a teenager and had been treated for less than 1 year with a medication that she could not recall; the symptoms had resolved by 19 years of age\\, and there had been no mental health follow-up. She also had a history of migraines\\, which occurred four times per week. She took aspirin\\, acetaminophen\\, and aspirin\u2013paracetamol\u2013caffeine as needed; there were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in Central America and had been living in the United States for 19 years. She lived with her husband\\, four children\\, and mother-in-law in an urban area of New England in a community that was predominantly Latinx and that had a high rate of Covid-19\u2013related infections and deaths. The patient did not complete high school while she was living in Central America and was currently employed full time in a food-production factory. She reported that she enjoyed her job but that she had been reluctant to work during the Covid-19 pandemic because of concern about becoming ill; however\\, she described that she felt obligated to work to support her family. The patient did not smoke cigarettes\\, drink alcohol\\, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from cancer. On examination\\, the temperature was 38.2\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 148/84 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 110 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared well-groomed and fatigued\\, and she was tearful with a depressed and dysphoric mood. Her behavior was described as \u201csullen\\,\u201d and there was limited eye contact and reduced psychomotor activity. Her speech\\, in Spanish\\, was fluent but was slow and mumbling\\, with reduced prosody. She had no derailment of thought\\, delusions\\, or obsessions\\, but she ruminated on her nightmares. She stated that she had no current suicidal ideation but that she might attempt suicide if she had to return to her children and expose them to SARS-CoV-2 again. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the chest revealed ground-glass opacities in the right middle and lower lobes and in the left lower lobe. Intravenous ceftriaxone\\, oral azithromycin\\, atorvastatin\\, and hydroxychloroquine were administered\\, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. TABLE 1  Laboratory Data.

    "user_input": "Dr. Patrick Malecha (Medicine): A 69-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "ischemic cardiomyopathy\\, and an implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) was evaluated because of dyspnea during an urgent visit at an outpatient primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 days before the current presentation\\, when he felt unwell while working. He had dyspnea on exertion (while moving and stocking boxes and when walking home from work)\\, with baseline exertional dyspnea that occurred after ascending two to three flights of stairs. The next day\\, the patient had palpitations and felt lightheaded throughout the day. The palpitations continued\\, and he was evaluated by his primary care physician at an outpatient primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital. On a review of systems\\, the patient reported nausea with intermittent retching\\, anorexia (eating only a slice of cheese for the day)\\, and fatigue. He stated that his right eye was \u201cout of focus\\,\u201d but he also noted that he had had this symptom in the past. He reported no chest pain or pressure. Although he had often had angina in the past\\, the patient noted that he had not had any episodes in the past 2 years and that he had had only one episode of substernal discomfort\\, which occurred while he was walking and had lasted 45 seconds. In addition\\, he had had no presyncope or loss of consciousness\\, ICD discharge\\, edema\\, orthopnea\\, paroxysms of nocturnal dyspnea\\, fever\\, known sick contacts\\, diarrhea\\, weight change\\, abdominal pain or bloating\\, dysuria\\, myalgia\\, arthralgia\\, rash\\, bleeding symptoms\\, or focal neurologic symptoms. He had not missed any doses of medications\\, and his last ICD check was 3 months before the current presentation. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for premature coronary artery disease\\, with a first occurrence of myocardial infarction in his third decade of life. In his fifth decade of life\\, he had undergone coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) and subsequent stenting of the native left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary angiography\\, which was performed 2 years earlier for evaluation of angina\\, showed that the bypass graft and stent were patent but that severe native coronary disease was present (and was unchanged from an earlier study). The patient\u2019s medical history also included ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronically reduced ejection fraction and scarring of the inferior and inferoposterior left ventricle\\, and ventricular tachycardia that had been treated with antiarrhythmic medication and an ICD. The ICD had been placed 3 years before the current presentation during an admission at this hospital for syncope that was followed by in-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia\\, which required multiple external defibrillations. Thereafter\\, the patient received treatment with oral amiodarone; however\\, device interrogation revealed intermittent ventricular tachycardia at rates of 109 to 117 beats per minute that persisted over the next 8 months\\, and he underwent endocardial ablation of ventricular tachycardia in the scar of the mid-inferior wall. Six months after ablation\\, he was readmitted to this hospital because of nausea and dizziness that were due to recurrent sustained slow ventricular tachycardia (110 beats per minute)\\, for which he was treated with intravenous lidocaine and antitachycardia pacing. In addition\\, the patient\u2019s medical history included bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement concurrent with CABG\\, which had been complicated by prosthetic valve deterioration with mixed stenosis and mitral regurgitation\\, and culminated in transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement 2.5 years before the current presentation. He also had a history of hypertension\\, pulmonary embolism (4 years before the current presentation)\\, iron-deficiency anemia\\, a colonic polyp\\, and prolonged encephalopathy after CABG. Medications included aspirin\\, coumadin\\, furosemide\\, metoprolol\\, lisinopril\\, dapagliflozin\\, ranolazine\\, atorvastatin\\, ferrous gluconate\\, paroxetine\\, and clonazepam. Treatment with amiodarone had previously been associated with elevations in liver-function test results. At the patient\u2019s last office visit with an electrophysiologist 6 months before the current presentation\\, device interrogation showed no ventricular tachycardia and the heart rate was 60 beats per minute; treatment with amiodarone was discontinued. Dr. Emily K. Zern: A transthoracic echocardiogram obtained at the same office visit with the electrophysiologist showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 31% with inferior\\, posterior\\, and apical territory dysfunction; right ventricular hypokinesis; a left-to-right interatrial shunt; trace-to-mild aortic insufficiency; a well-seated mitral valve prosthesis with no regurgitation and a mean transmitral gradient of 5 mm Hg; and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 31 mm Hg. Dr. Malecha: At a primary care visit 5 months before the current presentation\\, the patient reported bloating. The heart rate was 62 beats per minute and the blood pressure 104/64 mm Hg. The thyrotropin level was normal\\, the N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level 646 pg per milliliter (reference value\\, <900)\\, the hematocrit level 40.9% (reference range\\, 41.0 to 53.0)\\, and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level 74 mg per deciliter (1.92 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 50 to 129 mg per deciliter [1.29 to 3.34 mmol per liter]). The patient had had a routine office visit with his cardiologist 18 days before the current presentation\\, during which the heart rate was 63 beats per minute and the blood pressure 111/69 mm Hg; the weight was 83 kg. No changes were made to his medications. Dr. Conor D. Barrett: An electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained at the visit with the cardiologist showed atrial pacing\\, first-degree atrioventricular delay\\, right bundle-branch block\\, and evidence of old inferior\\, apical\\, and posterior myocardial infarctions (Figure 1). FIGURE 1  Initial Electrocardiogram. Dr. Malecha: The patient was employed in multiple service jobs. He did not drink alcohol or use tobacco or other substances. He lived with several roommates on the fourth floor of an apartment building in an urban area and climbed stairs daily. His family history was notable for coronary artery disease in his father and stroke in his father\\, mother\\, and maternal grandmother. At the current presentation\\, the temporal temperature was 35.7\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 124 beats per minute and regular\\, the blood pressure 84/59 mm Hg while the patient was sitting and 99/67 mm Hg while he was in the supine position\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83 kg. The patient appeared diaphoretic and clammy\\, and the skin was warm to the touch. He was alert\\, oriented\\, and lucid. The previous sternotomy and ICD sites were intact. There was no heart murmur; however\\, a possible S3 heart sound and minimal basilar rales were observed. The jugular venous pulse was difficult to visualize. A healed appendectomy scar was present\\, but the abdomen was nontender\\, the liver was nonpulsatile\\, and there was no fluid wave. The legs were warm with mild\\, symmetric pedal edema. Laboratory test results were obtained 2 weeks before the current presentation. The sodium level was 139 mmol per liter (reference range\\, 135 to 145)\\, the potassium level 4.1 mmol per liter (reference range\\, 3.4 to 5.0)\\, the creatinine level 0.91 mg per deciliter (80.44 \u03bcg per liter; reference range\\, 0.80 to 1.30 mg per deciliter [70.72 to 114.92 \u03bcg per liter])\\, the hematocrit 44.0%\\, the NT-proBNP 669 pg per milliliter\\, and the international normalized ratio (INR) 2.9 (reference range\\, 0.9 to 1.1). Diagnostic tests were performed\\, and management decisions were made.,Postmyocardial infarction (scar-related) reentrant ventricular tachycardia."

    "ground_truth_output": "when dysphagia developed. One month later\\, she was evaluated by her primary care physician. She reported having a sensation that pills and food were getting stuck in her throat when she swallowed. She was unable to take her medications\\, and her food intake had decreased to two eggs per day. She estimated that her weight had decreased by 5 kg during the previous month. She was referred for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)\\, which reportedly revealed ulceration of the gastrojejunal junction from a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass performed 12 years earlier but otherwise normal mucosa. Examination of biopsy specimens obtained during the procedure reportedly revealed findings consistent with lymphocytic esophagitis. Treatment with swallowed fluticasone was recommended. Three months before the current presentation\\, leg swelling developed\\, and the patient was again evaluated by her primary care physician. She had stopped using fluticasone after 1 week of treatment because she had not noticed any decrease in the dysphagia. Her weight had decreased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month earlier. Pitting edema was present in the legs. A diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency was considered\\, and compression stockings were recommended. Two months before the current presentation\\, leg swelling worsened\\, arm swelling developed\\, and the patient had trouble performing activities of daily living. She was admitted to another hospital. She reported persistent dysphagia and reduced food intake. Her weight had increased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month earlier. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The blood albumin level was 2.2 g per deciliter (reference range\\, 3.5 to 4.8)\\, and the zinc level was 0.36 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range\\, 0.66 to 1.10). Blood levels of vitamin B2\\, vitamin B12\\, folate\\, and methylmalonate were normal; the blood level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide was normal for the patient\u2019s age. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The albumin:creatinine ratio in a random urine sample was 11.6 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine (reference value\\, <30.0).

Pitting edema of the arms and legs was attributed to hypoalbuminemia from limited oral intake\\, which was related to dysphagia from untreated lymphocytic esophagitis. The use of fluticasone was encouraged\\, and supplemental nutritional drinks were recommended\\, along with a multivitamin and zinc sulfate. On the fourth hospital day\\, the patient was discharged home. One month before the current presentation\\, the patient was admitted to this hospital because of confusion and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Escherichia coli. Confusion resolved with treatment of the UTI. Her weight had decreased by 2 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. The patient reported loose stools without blood or mucus\\, which had occurred for 1 month. Edema was present. The blood albumin level was 1.7 g per deciliter\\, the zinc level 0.3 \u03bcg per milliliter\\, the selenium level 34 ng per milliliter (reference range\\, 70 to 150)\\, the vitamin A level 16.6 \u03bcg per deciliter (reference range\\, 32.5 to 78.0)\\, and the vitamin C level 0.2 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 0.4 to 2.0). Blood levels of vitamin B1 and vitamin B3 were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. EGD showed ulceration of the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. Biopsy specimens of the esophagus\\, stomach\\, and jejunum showed normal mucosa. A biopsy specimen of the gastrojejunal anastomosis showed small-intestinal mucosa with erosion and nonspecific morphologic features; periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining was negative for microorganisms\\, Congo red staining was negative for amyloid\\, and immunohistochemical staining was negative for cytomegalovirus. Magnetic resonance enterography of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed no evidence of active inflammatory bowel disease. A high-protein diet was recommended\\, along with a multivitamin\\, zinc sulfate\\, and selenium. On the eighth hospital day\\, the patient was discharged home. After discharge\\, the patient initially felt well. The edema abated\\, and her appetite improved. She began to have six small meals and three protein shakes per day. Two weeks after discharge\\, and 1 week before the current presentation\\, confusion developed\\, and the gait became unsteady; she began using a walker for ambulation. During the next week\\, confusion increased\\, and she fell while walking. Her family brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department\\, she was unable to answer questions about her history. Her family reported that she had had slowed and slurred speech for the past week and increasing difficulty with attention\\, including difficulty with holding a conversation. Other medical history included chronic back pain\\, bipolar disorder\\, seizure disorder\\, and ulcerative colitis. Medications included carbamazepine\\, ergocalciferol\\, fluticasone\\, gabapentin\\, mesalamine\\, methocarbamol\\, mirtazapine\\, a multivitamin\\, olanzapine\\, omeprazole\\, oxycodone\u2013acetaminophen\\, selenium\\, sucralfate\\, thiamine\\, topiramate\\, and zinc sulfate. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was receiving disability benefits and did not work because of chronic back pain. She had smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 35 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had endometrial cancer\\, and her father had lung cancer. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 89/52 mm Hg\\, the pulse 132 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.9. Her weight had decreased by 6 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. She appeared chronically ill and was lethargic but arose in response to voice. She moved her arms and legs but did not participate in a detailed neurologic examination. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The white-cell count was 17\\,150 per microliter (reference range\\, 4500 to 11\\,000)\\, with neutrophil predominance. The blood zinc level was 0.35 \u03bcg per milliliter\\, the copper level 0.28 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range\\, 0.75 to 1.45)\\, and the vitamin B6 level less than 2 \u03bcg per liter (reference range\\, 5 to 50). Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and 50 to 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value\\, <10). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal\\, without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Urine\\, blood\\, and stool specimens were obtained for culture. Three liters of intravenous lactated Ringer\u2019s solution were administered\\, and the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Three hours after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department\\, she became more lethargic and had no response to voice; she reacted to being shaken but did not open her eyes or answer questions. Additional imaging studies were performed. Dr. Theodore T. Pierce: Computed tomography (CT) of the head\\, performed without the administration of contrast material\\, showed no abnormalities. CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis (Figure 1)\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed diffuse hepatic steatosis\\, as well as mucosal hyperenhancement and submucosal edema involving portions of the small and large bowel\\, with relative sparing of the distal jejunum\\, proximal ileum\\, descending colon\\, and sigmoid colon. FIGURE 1  CT of the Abdomen and Pelvis. Dr. Bobkowski: Treatment with intravenous vancomycin\\, cefepime\\, and metronidazole was initiated. Six hours after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department\\, the blood pressure decreased to 85/45 mm Hg\\, and the heart rate increased to 132 beats per minute. There was no response to painful stimuli. Myoclonic jerking movements were observed. Treatment with norepinephrine was initiated\\, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The trachea was intubated for airway protection\\, and sedation with propofol and dexmedetomidine was initiated. Treatment with vancomycin\\, cefepime\\, and metronidazole was continued; prescribed medications of carbamazepine\\, a multivitamin\\, omeprazole\\, selenium\\, sucralfate\\, thiamine\\, topiramate\\, and zinc sulfate were administered. On the first hospital day\\, the blood pressure increased\\, and vasopressors and sedative medications were discontinued. The patient had no spontaneous interaction or speech production. She did not follow commands or grimace in response to noxious stimuli. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The corneal reflexes were intact\\, as were the cough and gag reflexes. There was no spontaneous movement of the arms or legs\\, but they withdrew in response to pain; the deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The results of CT of the head were normal. Sedation was not resumed\\, and serial neurologic examinations were performed. On the second hospital day\\, leukocytosis had resolved\\, but the patient\u2019s mental status had not improved. Electroencephalography (EEG) with long-term monitoring revealed near-continuous generalized periodic discharges with triphasic morphologic features\\, often with superimposed rhythmic activity. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head were normal\\, as were the results of magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck. Lumbar puncture was performed\\, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed normal protein levels and no nucleated cells. The urine culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. The blood and stool cultures were negative\\, as was a stool test for Clostridioides difficile and an examination of the stool for ova and parasites. Treatment with vancomycin\\, cefepime\\, and metronidazole was stopped\\, and treatment with ciprofloxacin was started. On the third hospital day\\, the patient\u2019s mental status had not improved. EGD showed a small scar at the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. The results of flexible sigmoidoscopy were normal. Biopsy specimens of the jejunum and descending colon showed normal mucosa. A diagnostic test was performed.,Noncirrhotic hyperammonemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass."

Schell (Medicine): A 25-year-old woman with a history of acute intermittent porphyria was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and jerking movements of the right arm and leg. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 days before this admission\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed. She also felt confused and agitated\\, and a rash developed on her chest. One day before this admission\\, four episodes of jerking movements of the right arm and leg occurred\\, and the patient was concerned that she was having seizures. She presented to another hospital for evaluation. At the other hospital\\, the patient reported that the symptoms were consistent with her previous flares of acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that jerking movements of the right arm and leg had occurred 5 minutes before her arrival at the hospital and had caused jaw dislocation; she also reported that the rash on her chest had become painful. On examination\\, the patient appeared uncomfortable. The mental-status and neurologic examinations were reportedly normal. The jaw was dislocated to the left\\, and there was diffuse abdominal tenderness. Intravenous morphine\\, diphenhydramine\\, and ondansetron were administered; an infusion of dextrose was started; and the dislocated jaw was manually reduced. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. The next day\\, the severity of pain in the abdomen and rash increased. Transfer to this hospital was requested because of a shortage of hemin at the other hospital. On evaluation at this hospital\\, the patient described intense pain in the abdomen\\, a painful rash\\, and persistent nausea\\, agitation\\, and confusion. She was worried that she might have seizures\\, have blistering of the skin\\, or die because the hemin infusion had been delayed. Additional history was obtained from the patient. She had a history of obesity\\, anxiety\\, and chronic pain that had been attributed to acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that acute intermittent porphyria had been diagnosed 13 years before this admission\\, when abdominal pain\\, jerking movements of the right arm and leg\\, and a painful rash developed during menarche. During the 13 years before this admission\\, one or two flares of acute intermittent porphyria had occurred each year; during the 6 months before this admission\\, no flares had occurred. Two previous flares of acute intermittent porphyria had been treated with a hemin infusion. During the first hemin infusion\\, the patient had a reaction that was characterized by intense yelling and writhing in pain\\, and intubation was performed to complete the infusion. Before the second hemin infusion\\, she received intravenous methylprednisolone and underwent elective intubation to prevent a reaction. The patient identified heat\\, stress\\, and menses as triggers for acute intermittent porphyria flares. Medications included intravenous diphenhydramine and dextrose\\, which were administered daily through a central-venous-access port in the right side of the chest. The patient had previously taken intravenous morphine daily; however\\, she had not had access to this medication for approximately 3 months because of an inability to transport it from her home in the United Kingdom. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and penicillin had caused anaphylaxis\\, prochlorperazine had caused flushing\\, metoclopramide had caused anxiety\\, and fentanyl had caused altered mental status. The patient was born in New England and had moved to the United Kingdom 15 years earlier. She was a student in a graduate program at a university in the United Kingdom and had returned to New England to visit her family. She did not use alcohol or illicit drugs\\, and she did not vape or smoke cigarettes. Her mother had dementia\\, and her father had died years earlier from an unknown cause. Her maternal grandmother had acute intermittent porphyria. Her immediate family had undergone genetic testing for acute intermittent porphyria; her brother was an asymptomatic carrier of a pathogenic variant\\, and her six other siblings were not carriers. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 144/90 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 100 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared older than her stated age. She was awake\\, alert\\, and oriented. She was frustrated and irritable\\, with pressured speech. A port in the right side of the chest was palpated. Tenderness in the abdomen was diffuse but was worst in the right upper quadrant. Erythematous plaques and excoriations were present on the arms and chest and under the breasts. The neurologic examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes\\, calcium\\, total protein\\, albumin\\, and globulin were normal\\, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The hemoglobin level was 10.6 g per deciliter (reference range\\, 12.0 to 16.0) and the platelet count 120\\,000 per microliter (reference range\\, 150\\,000 to 400\\,000). A urine specimen was obtained for measurement of the urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) and porphyrin levels\\, but the amount of urine was inadequate. Oral acetaminophen and intravenous morphine\\, diphenhydramine\\, lorazepam\\, and ondansetron were administered. Infusions of dextrose and hemin were started\\, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the subsequent 2 days\\, the hemin infusion was continued\\, but the patient\u2019s symptoms did not abate. On the second hospital day\\, an additional urine specimen was obtained; the urinary PBG level was 0.3 \u03bcmol per liter (reference range\\, 0.0 to 1.3) and the uroporphyrin level 4 nmol per liter (reference range\\, 0 to 30). On the third hospital day\\, the patient reported worsening jerking movements of the right arm and leg\\, which she believed had caused jaw dislocation. On examination\\, the jaw was dislocated to the left. She did not cooperate with a manual reduction\\, and a surgical reduction of the jaw was performed. A diagnosis was made.,Factitious disorder."

The findings of computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck were reportedly normal. MRI of the head reportedly showed signal hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed elevated levels of glucose and protein with a normal cell count; nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus DNA was negative. Blood and CSF paraneoplastic autoantibody and autoimmune encephalopathy panels were unrevealing. The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Screening tests for syphilis and antinuclear antibodies were negative. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized slowing\\, with no epileptiform discharges. A diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis was considered\\, and treatment included intravenous glucocorticoids for 5 days\\, followed by treatment with daily oral prednisone. Expressive aphasia resolved and confusion abated\\, but auditory aphasia persisted. CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis revealed a mass measuring 5 cm in diameter in the pelvis that was composed of fat\\, soft tissue\\, and calcifications. Laparotomy was performed\\, and pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with a mature cystic teratoma. The patient was discharged home after a 3-week hospitalization\\, with a plan to taper the dose of oral prednisone after discharge. One week after the patient\u2019s discharge from the other hospital\\, after the dose of prednisone had been decreased\\, malaise developed and confusion recurred. The patient was readmitted to the other hospital. MRI of the head reportedly showed a decrease in the left temporal lobe hyperintensities relative to the previous imaging study. The dose of prednisone was increased\\, confusion again abated\\, and the patient was discharged home. The dose of glucocorticoids was gradually tapered. Six months before the current presentation\\, confusion recurred\\, and the patient was readmitted to the other hospital. Imaging studies were performed. Dr. Otto Rapalino: MRI of the head reportedly showed progression of the signal hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe on T2-weighted FLAIR images. Dr. Liu: A diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis was again considered. Treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids was reinitiated\\, which resulted in some reduction in confusion. The patient was discharged home with instructions to continue oral prednisone therapy\\, with a plan to again gradually taper the dose. Three months before the current presentation\\, confusion recurred. The patient was again admitted to the other hospital\\, and imaging studies were repeated. Dr. Rapalino: MRI of the head reportedly showed progression of the hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe and new signal hyperintensities in the right temporal and left occipital lobes. Dr. Liu: Treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids\\, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole\\, intravenous immunoglobulin\\, and rituximab was initiated. The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility\\, with a plan for weekly rituximab infusions for 5 weeks and a 6-week tapering course of daily oral prednisone therapy. Confusion resolved and did not recur. Dr. Rapalino: Three weeks before the current presentation\\, MRI of the head\\, which was performed to evaluate the response to immunosuppressive medications\\, reportedly showed hyperintensity in both temporal lobes\\, with extension to the anterior aspects of the parietal lobes\\, on T2-weighted FLAIR images. Enhancement involving the subinsular regions was present\\, along with restricted diffusion in the insular cortexes. Positron-emission tomography (PET)\u2013CT of the skull base to the midthighs reportedly showed no abnormalities. Dr. Liu: Two weeks before the current presentation\\, the patient was evaluated by her neurologist in the clinic\\, who recommended admission to the hospital for additional treatment owing to the progressively worsening findings on head imaging. One week before the current presentation\\, she was admitted to the other hospital. Treatment included daily intravenous immunoglobulin for 5 days and mycophenolate mofetil. On the third hospital day\\, she fell and struck her forehead while walking to the bathroom. On the sixth hospital day\\, she was transferred to this hospital to potentially undergo a brain biopsy. On arrival at this hospital\\, the patient reported pain on her forehead where she had struck her head during her fall. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus\\, hypertension\\, sensorineural hearing loss (which had been diagnosed when she was 45 years of age)\\, and depression. The results of a routine screening colonoscopy that had been performed 4 years before the current presentation had been normal. In additional to mycophenolate mofetil and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole\\, medications included ascorbic acid\\, cholecalciferol\\, glipizide\\, magnesium oxide\\, metoprolol\\, omeprazole\\, sertraline\\, and thiamine.

Both her brothers had diabetes\\, along with hearing loss in both ears. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 154/90 mm Hg\\, the pulse 76 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 157.5 cm\\, the weight 34 kg\\, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 13.7. Ecchymoses and a healing laceration were present on the right side of the forehead. The patient had receptive aphasia\\, which severely limited her ability to understand oral speech\\, but she could comprehend written or typed questions. She was alert and interactive and oriented to person\\, place\\, and time. Her speech was fluent\\, with no paraphasic errors. She was able to follow simple and complex commands without difficulty. Concentration and attention were intact. No abnormalities involving the cranial nerves were noted\\, with the exception of anisocoria; the left pupil measured 5 mm in diameter\\, and the right pupil measured 3 mm in diameter. Both pupils were reactive to light. The muscle bulk was decreased\\, but muscle tone and strength were normal. Tests of sensation\\, deep-tendon reflexes\\, and cerebellar function showed normal results. The blood levels of electrolytes\\, glucose\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, and total bilirubin were normal\\, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The blood level of lactate was 2.6 mmol per liter. The complete blood count with differential count was normal\\, except for the level of hemoglobin (11.3 g per deciliter; reference range\\, 12.0 to 16.0). Diagnostic tests were performed.,MIDD (maternally inherited diabetes and deafness) and MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy\\, lactic acidosis\\, and strokelike episodes) associated with the m.3243A\u2192G pathogenic variant."

The patient had been well until 3 months before admission to this hospital\\, when fatigue and a transient pruritic maculopapular rash on the forearm developed. During the next 6 weeks\\, the forearm rash resolved but fatigue persisted. The patient began to take naps during the daytime and was unable to put in full days at his job in construction work. He also began to have night sweats and fevers with temperatures of up to 37.8\u00b0C. Twenty-seven days before admission to this hospital\\, the patient found that he was unable to work because of fatigue\\, and he sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Blood tests for anaplasma and babesia nucleic acids were negative\\, but screening and confirmatory tests for Lyme disease IgM and IgG were positive. A diagnosis of Lyme disease was made\\, and treatment with doxycycline was initiated. Because gastrointestinal upset developed\\, doxycycline was discontinued and amoxicillin was prescribed for the remainder of the 14-day course. Sixteen days before admission to this hospital\\, the patient began to have chest discomfort\\, which he described as a sensation of a \u201csoftball\u201d in his left lower chest. The chest discomfort limited his ability to breathe\\, and his primary care physician referred him to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation\\, he reported increasing fatigue and malaise\\, night sweats\\, and fevers\\, along with diffuse arthralgias and myalgias\\, headache\\, photophobia with some visual flashes\\, dyspnea on exertion\\, edema\\, a pruritic erythematous rash on his chest\\, anorexia\\, nausea\\, vomiting\\, abdominal discomfort and distention\\, and watery diarrhea that occurred three times per day. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 145/84 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 61 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.1. There was a faint diffuse erythematous macular rash on the anterior portion of the chest. The abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, bilirubin\\, and lipase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram was normal. Intravenous normal saline and oral acetaminophen were administered\\, as was empirical treatment with intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam\\, hydromorphone\\, and ondansetron.

Goiffon: Fifteen days before admission to this hospital\\, computed tomography (CT) of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis (Figure 1A\\, 1B\\, and 1C)\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a bilobed heterogeneous soft-tissue mass\\, measuring 6.1 cm by 2.8 cm\\, in the anterior mediastinum. There were multiple enlarged subcarinal and mediastinal lymph nodes (measuring up to 15 mm in short-axis diameter)\\, multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (measuring up to 11 mm in short-axis diameter)\\, mesenteric fat stranding\\, and trace ascites. FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies. Dr. Logeman: Abdominal discomfort persisted; piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was discontinued and ceftriaxone was prescribed. Two days later\\, CT of the abdomen\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed new pulmonary edema\\, new small bilateral pleural effusions\\, and an increased volume of ascites. The patient was transferred to a second hospital for further evaluation. Physical examination was notable for mild abdominal tenderness and distention\\, as well as leg edema. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, and bilirubin and a urinalysis were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) (Figure 1D) revealed indeterminate low-level FDG uptake in the anterior mediastinal soft tissue\\, as well as in pleural effusions and mediastinal lymph nodes. During the next week\\, dyspnea and abdominal pain persisted. Edema increased\\, specifically in the abdomen\\, legs\\, and face; the weight increased to 93.0 kg. Intravenous ceftriaxone and metoclopramide and oral hydromorphone\\, ondansetron\\, and lactulose were administered. Additional laboratory tests were performed (Table 2). TABLE 2  Additional Laboratory Data. On the eighth day at the second hospital\\, video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed. The mediastinum reportedly appeared inflamed. The patient underwent an evacuation of pleural fluid and a biopsy of mediastinal soft tissue and lymph nodes primarily in the subcarinal window (level VII). On pathological examination of the biopsy specimens\\, the mediastinal soft tissue showed fibroconnective and adipose tissue with fibrosis\\, mild inflammation and fat necrosis\\, prominent capillary proliferation\\, and congestion; the lymph nodes were reportedly \u201cmildly abnormal.\u201d Microbiologic evaluation of the biopsy specimens revealed occasional leukocytes but no acid-fast bacilli or fungal elements. On flow cytometry of the biopsy specimens\\, the mediastinal soft tissue did not show any abnormal cell populations; the lymph nodes contained polyclonal B-cell and heterogeneous T-cell populations\\, without immunophenotypic evidence of lymphoma. Bacterial\\, fungal\\, and mycobacterial cultures of the biopsy specimens were negative. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid revealed reactive mesothelial cells\\, lymphocytes\\, and histiocytes but no malignant cells. After the procedure\\, the creatinine level increased to 2.93 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 0.50 to 1.30). Examination of urinary sediment revealed hyaline and granular casts. Intravenous furosemide was administered. On the 15th day at the second hospital\\, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On arrival\\, the patient reported persistent fatigue\\, mild dyspnea\\, abdominal distention\\, edema\\, and anorexia. Nausea\\, vomiting\\, diarrhea\\, and the chest rash had resolved. Fevers and night sweats had occurred in a waxing and waning pattern during the previous weeks. He reported intermittent photophobia and headache\\, without neck stiffness or phonophobia\\, and had no other neurologic symptoms. The patient had no history of illness and had not received routine medical care as an adult. He took ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed and had no known allergies to medications. He had been exposed to dust through his job in construction work. He lived with his wife\\, child\\, and pet dog and cat in a coastal wooded community in New England. He frequently spent time outdoors\\, either working or playing golf\\, and had received multiple tick bites. He had traveled to the Mediterranean and Oceania regions in previous years and\\, more recently\\, to the southwestern United States. The patient had never used tobacco or illicit drugs and drank beer rarely. His father had had prostate cancer and colon cancer. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 148/82 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 78 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 91.7 kg. Neurologic examination was normal\\, and there was no nuchal rigidity. There were inspiratory crackles in the left lung. The abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Mild fluctuance was noted on the right side of the chest\\, at the site of the surgical incision. There was no palpable cervical\\, supraclavicular\\, submandibular\\, submental\\, axillary\\, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There was 2+ pitting edema in the legs. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, bilirubin\\, ceruloplasmin\\, fibrinogen\\, folate\\, globulin\\, haptoglobin\\, and vitamin B12 were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed cloudy yellow urine with 2+ protein and 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range\\, 0 to 2). An electrocardiogram was normal. Dr. Goiffon: CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis (Figure 1E)\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed an anterior mediastinal mass\\, measuring 6.1 cm by 1.9 cm\\, which was slightly smaller than it had been on the previous chest CT. There were enlarged perivascular\\, paratracheal\\, subcarinal\\, and aortopulmonary mediastinal lymph nodes (measuring up to 12 mm in short-axis diameter) with heterogeneous enhancement. Increased pulmonary edema\\, moderate bilateral pleural effusions\\, moderate-volume ascites\\, mild splenomegaly\\, and multiple subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes were detected. Dr. Logeman: On the third hospital day\\, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed no abnormalities. On the fourth day\\, a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Intravenous furosemide and oral acetaminophen were administered. Lumbar puncture was performed\\, and 26 ml of colorless fluid was removed; opening pressure was not measured. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix\\, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. On the fifth day\\, renal ultrasonography revealed kidneys of normal size with normal parenchyma and no hydronephrosis. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed; results of ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table S1. Dr. Goiffon: On the 13th day\\, MRI of the chest was started but could not be completed because the patient had respiratory distress when placed in the prone position. Sequences that were obtained before termination of the study (Figure 1F) showed an anterior mediastinal soft-tissue mass with hypointensity on steady-state gradient echo imaging; the mass was smaller than it had been on chest CT performed before transfer to this hospital. In addition\\, there were enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes\\, large bilateral pleural effusions\\, ascites\\, and a hematoma at the site of the surgical incision. Dr. Logeman: Additional laboratory tests were performed (Table 2). A diagnosis was made.,Idiopathic multicentric Castleman\u2019s disease."

    "ground_truth_output": "myalgias\\, and one previous episode of vomiting. Nine months before this admission\\, the patient was admitted to another hospital with cough and shortness of breath\\, and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia was diagnosed. He received remdesivir\\, dexamethasone\\, and supplemental oxygen\\, which was delivered through a high-flow nasal cannula. His clinical condition gradually improved\\, and he was discharged home with supplemental oxygen\\, which was to be administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. While the patient was recovering at home\\, cough persisted and shortness of breath worsened\\, despite treatment with prednisone. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital\\, organizing pneumonia was diagnosed. Pulmonary-function testing revealed a severe restrictive ventilatory defect with impaired gas exchange\\, and findings on computed tomography (CT) of the chest were consistent with organizing pneumonia superimposed on fibrotic interstitial lung disease. Treatment with pirfenidone and mycophenolate mofetil was initiated\\, and the dose of prednisone was increased. Despite the use of these treatments\\, there was no decrease in dyspnea; consequently\\, treatment with pirfenidone was stopped\\, and the dose of prednisone was tapered over the course of the 2 months before the current admission. Because of persistent severe dyspnea on exertion\\, the patient was listed for lung transplantation 2 weeks before the current admission. Two days before the current admission\\, myalgias and nausea developed\\, and an episode of vomiting occurred. The tympanic temperature\\, as measured by the patient at home\\, was 40.0\u00b0C. There was also a slight increase in shortness of breath\\, and the patient began to administer supplemental oxygen at an increased rate of 5 liters per minute. One day before the current admission\\, a home test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen was negative. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department\\, the patient reported a chronic dry cough that was unchanged. Other medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease\\, obstructive sleep apnea\\, and prostate cancer that had been treated surgically 4 years before this admission. Medications included albuterol\\, calcium carbonate\\, cholecalciferol\\, ipratropium\u2013albuterol delivered by nebulizer\\, mycophenolate mofetil\\, pantoprazole\\, prednisone\\, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. He had no known drug allergies. He drank three or four alcoholic drinks per week and was a lifelong nonsmoker. He lived in a rural area of New England on five acres of land with woods. He used well water at home\\, but he boiled drinking water before consumption. He owned a dog\\, and he spent time outdoors\\, including mowing the lawn 1 week before this admission. He had had mosquito bites but no known tick bites. He was retired from previous work as a welder. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 126/67 mm Hg\\, the pulse 91 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.8. Respirations were slightly labored\\, and the patient spoke in short sentences. He was alert and oriented and answered questions appropriately. No oral thrush was present. There were crackles at the bases of both lung fields. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal\\, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Urinalysis results were normal. The blood level of 1\\,3-\u03b2-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value\\, <60)\\, and the blood galactomannan index was 0.13 (reference range\\, 0.00 to 0.49).

A sacral dimple was noted. The patient\u2019s mother was referred to the maternal\u2013fetal medicine clinic of the other hospital; she declined follow-up imaging and amniocentesis. At 37 weeks 6 days of gestation\\, premature labor occurred\\, and the patient\u2019s mother was taken to a second hospital. A fetal heart tracing was noted to be nonreactive with minimal variability. The fetal biophysical profile score was 4 out of 8\\, indicating decreased breathing motion and body movement but normal tone and amniotic fluid volume. An emergency cesarean section was performed. On delivery\\, the newborn had limp tone and poor respiratory effort. The birth weight was 2963 g (19th percentile)\\, the length 48 cm (20th percentile)\\, and the head circumference 35 cm (77th percentile). The Apgar scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes were 7 and 9\\, respectively. The patient was transferred to the newborn nursery. In the nursery\\, the patient was noted to be jittery. Oxygen therapy was administered through a low-flow nasal cannula. The blood glucose level was reportedly less than 10 mg per deciliter (0.6 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]) and the bilirubin level 16.0 mg per deciliter (274 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range\\, 2.0 to 15.0 mg per deciliter [34 to 257 \u03bcmol per liter]). A chest radiograph showed a normal cardiac shadow and findings indicative of retained fetal lung fluid. The newborn was fed\\, and a bolus of dextrose was administered; however\\, a repeat blood glucose level was 2 mg per deciliter (0.1 mmol per liter). A continuous infusion of dextrose was started. Phototherapy and empirical treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin were administered. During the next 3 days\\, the patient\u2019s blood glucose level remained low\\, with a maximum level of 61 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter)\\, even though the glucose infusion rate was increased and enteral feeding with formula was initiated.

At another hospital\\, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reportedly revealed an incidental 14-cm necrotic mass in the pelvis\\, anterior to the bladder. Biopsy of the mass was reportedly diagnostic of a solitary fibrous tumor. The patient was referred to the multidisciplinary oncology clinic of this hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest\\, performed for staging\\, revealed two 9-mm nodules in the left lung. The patient was treated with a 3-month course of dacarbazine chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy targeting the pelvic mass\\, and then he underwent surgical resection of the pelvic tumor\\, including partial cystectomy and placement of a ureteral stent. Pathological examination of the resected specimen (Figure 1) confirmed the diagnosis of spindle-cell sarcoma with features consistent with a dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumor. Immunohistochemical staining of the resected specimen revealed signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and CD34 in the tumor cells. Stereotactic radiation therapy for the lung nodules was also administered. FIGURE 1  Specimen of the Resected Mass. However\\, metastatic disease progressed in the lungs\\, chest\\, bladder\\, and right leg. Over the subsequent 12-month period\\, the patient underwent serial treatment with four different chemotherapeutic regimens: pazopanib\\, doxorubicin with olaratumab\\, gemcitabine with docetaxel\\, and vinorelbine. Palliative radiation therapy for a painful leg metastasis was also provided. Eleven days after the initiation of vinorelbine chemotherapy and 30 days before the current admission\\, the patient was admitted to this hospital with fever (temperature\\, 38.3\u00b0C)\\, neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count\\, 770 per microliter; reference range\\, 1800 to 7700)\\, and pneumonia in the left lower lobe.

On the seventh hospital day\\, the patient was discharged home with a follow-up visit scheduled in the oncology clinic. Eleven days after hospital discharge and 12 days before the current admission\\, the patient attended a scheduled outpatient visit for an infusion. He reported weakness and appeared confused. A fingerstick glucose level was 47 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter). Supplemental oral and intravenous glucose was administered\\, and his mental status improved\\, but fingerstick glucose levels remained below 70 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter). Review of fingerstick glucose measurements obtained during the patient\u2019s recent hospitalization showed multiple levels ranging from 50 to 60 mg per deciliter (2.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter). The patient was admitted to the oncology unit of this hospital for the management of hypoglycemia. Laboratory test results from the second hospital admission are shown in Table 1. While the patient was in the hospital\\, he began to have diaphoresis that correlated with episodes of hypoglycemia\\, for which he received orange juice and dextrose.

The day after the dexamethasone course was completed\\, the patient reported increased fatigue and cough. Two days later\\, he was admitted to the oncology unit because of weakness and diaphoresis; a fingerstick glucose level was 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter). On the current admission\\, review of systems was notable for fatigue; pain associated with tumors involving the back\\, shoulders\\, and right leg; numbness of the right leg; the use of an indwelling Foley catheter for 2 months owing to urinary retention; dull chest pain and intermittent dyspnea that had persisted for 4 months; and constipation. The patient had no recent anorexia\\, weight change\\, fever\\, chills\\, orthopnea\\, hemoptysis\\, light-headedness\\, dizziness\\, palpitations\\, syncope\\, nausea\\, or vomiting. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for transfusion-dependent anemia\\, type 2 diabetes mellitus (for which he had received metformin\\, although not in the previous 6 months)\\, hypertension\\, a colonic tubular adenoma\\, a renal cyst\\, osteoarthritis\\, chronic low-back pain\\, and depression. He had undergone an appendectomy in the remote past. Medications included oral gabapentin\\, cyanocobalamin\\, tamsulosin\\, and finasteride; transdermal fentanyl; and oral acetaminophen\\, clonazepam\\, melatonin\\, polyethylene glycol\\, and oxycodone as needed. He had no access to insulin or other hypoglycemic medications. There were no known adverse drug reactions. The patient had formerly worked as a laborer and had been receiving disability benefits since the motor vehicle accident. He had previously consumed six beers per week and smoked one pack of cigarettes per day\\, but he had stopped drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco 1 year earlier. There was no history of other substance use. His family history of cancer included melanoma in his father\\, thyroid cancer in his sister\\, ovarian cancer in his maternal grandmother\\, leukemia in his maternal aunt\\, and sarcoma in his paternal uncle. His mother had hypertension and dyslipidemia\\, and a brother had diabetes. The patient had an adult child\\, who was healthy. The tympanic temperature was 37.0\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 92 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 148/87 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Multiple tender\\, palpable masses were present\\, including masses on the left shoulder\\, neck\\, and left upper leg. A venous-access port was in place in the chest wall on the right side. The abdominal incision was well healed. A Foley catheter was in place\\, and there was pink-tinged urine. A faint rash was present on the lower abdomen at the site of previous radiation therapy. Edema was present in both legs. Laboratory test results from the current hospital admission are shown in Table 1. Dr. Goiffon: A chest radiograph (Figure 2B) showed abundant metastatic pulmonary nodules. CT of the chest (Figure 2C and 2D)\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, showed that the nodules had increased in size and quantity over a period of 1 month. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Dr. Cote: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm\\, a leftward axis\\, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes\\, and intraventricular conduction delay. On the first hospital day\\, although the patient was receiving a continuous infusion of dextrose\\, five bolus injections of dextrose and six glasses of orange juice were needed to increase the blood glucose level to more than 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter). On the morning of the second hospital day\\, the blood glucose level was 42 mg per deciliter (2.3 mmol per liter). Treatment with oral prednisone was initiated. A diagnosis was made.,Doege\u2013Potter syndrome."

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) with stavudine\\, lamivudine\\, and efavirenz was started. During the subsequent year\\, the symptoms resolved\\, the HIV RNA level became undetectable\\, and the patient reported adherence to her medications. Ten years before the current presentation\\, additional ART became accessible within South Africa\\, and the ART regimen was changed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\\, emtricitabine\\, and efavirenz. Five years before the current presentation\\, the patient was admitted to a local hospital because of diarrhea and diffuse myalgias\\, and she was found to have virologic failure. The ART regimen was changed to zidovudine\\, lamivudine\\, and lopinavir\u2013ritonavir.

Dhami: A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material\\, revealed a small hiatal hernia\\, multiple simple cysts in the right kidney\\, and indeterminate bilateral pelvic masses measuring 4.8 cm in diameter on the right side and 6.3 cm in diameter on the left side (Figure 1). FIGURE 1  CT of the Abdomen and Pelvis. Dr. Pappas: Intravenous fluids were administered\\, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. On hospital day 2\\, the hemoglobin level decreased to 6.6 g per deciliter\\, and two units of packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed diffuse esophageal inflammation with white exudates throughout the esophagus; examination of brushings revealed yeast consistent with candida\\, and treatment with fluconazole was initiated. During the next 3 hospital days\\, the patient continued to feel unwell\\, with persistent fever and limited oral intake due to odynophagia\\, and the administration of intravenous fluids was continued. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. On hospital day 5\\, empirical therapy with doxycycline was started because of concerns about a possible tickborne illness. On hospital day 6\\, the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 94% when oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. CT of the chest\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening\\, findings consistent with pulmonary edema\\, along with bilateral pleural effusions of a small to moderate size. The administration of intravenous fluids was stopped\\, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was provided. On hospital day 7\\, fever resolved but pancytopenia persisted. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a moderate amount of schistocytes\\, severe anisocytosis\\, large platelets\\, and an increased amount of bands without blasts. Direct and indirect Coombs\u2019 tests were negative\\, as were nucleic acid tests for babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Blood levels of electrolytes\\, glucose\\, cobalamin\\, folate\\, homocysteine\\, and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were normal\\, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The results of serologic tests for Epstein\u2013Barr virus were consistent with previous infection. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed phenotypically normal myeloid cells; there was an increased amount of atypical CD34+ myeloblasts\\, which accounted for less than 1% of leukocytes and were of unclear clinical significance. A tunneled catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein\\, and plasma exchange was initiated for the treatment of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Total parenteral nutrition was also initiated\\, because oral intake was still limited by odynophagia. On hospital day 8\\, oral intake of soft foods and liquids increased. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function\\, as well as a mildly thickened aortic valve with no stenosis or regurgitation; there was trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. On hospital day 9\\, the patient underwent additional plasma exchange and was transferred to this hospital for further care. On evaluation in this hospital\\, the patient reported that her energy level had increased. She recalled that she had felt mildly confused at the other hospital\\, but the confusion had since resolved. She had had no gum bleeding or blood in the stool or urine. Other medical history included hypertension and dyslipidemia. Surgical history included hysterectomy at 40 years of age\\, with no vaginal bleeding since the procedure. One year earlier\\, routine laboratory testing had revealed mild thrombocytopenia and anemia. A bone marrow biopsy performed at that time had revealed slightly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis but with some erythroid abnormalities and occasional hyperchromatic megakaryocytes; cytogenetic analysis had shown a loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and a gain of chromosome 8 in 65% of the cells. Thereafter\\, blood counts monitored every 4 months\\, including 4 months before this presentation\\, had remained stable; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Medications included amlodipine\\, atorvastatin\\, and hydrochlorothiazide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. She had smoked tobacco for 50 years but had quit 5 years before this presentation. She was widowed and lived alone in New England; her work involved cleaning a church several days a week. Her sister had had breast cancer at 30 years of age\\, and a brother had had testicular cancer at a young age and liver cancer at 55 years of age. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 150/65 mm Hg\\, the pulse 72 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented\\, and she did not appear ill. There were no petechiae. There was no bleeding at the site of tunneled catheter placement in the right internal jugular vein. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard at the left lower sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes\\, anisocytosis\\, and a low platelet count\\, with large platelets present; the white cells appeared normal\\, and there were no blasts (Figure 2). The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. The levels of serum free kappa and lambda light chains were increased\\, with a normal ratio. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. Urinalysis showed 2+ urobilinogen\\, without bilirubin\\, blood\\, glucose\\, ketones\\, protein\\, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Consultation was obtained from the gynecology service regarding the bilateral pelvic masses noted on CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Blood levels of CA 125\\, CA 19-9\\, and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal\\, and follow-up in the gynecology clinic was recommended for further evaluation after discharge. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. FIGURE 2  Blood Specimen. A diagnostic test was performed\\, and management decisions were made.,Myelodysplastic syndrome."

During the next 2 weeks\\, the episodes of pain became more frequent\\, increasing from every few days to two times daily and lasting approximately 2 minutes. Two weeks before the current presentation\\, the patient had new nausea\\, and she vomited three times. She was not able to go to school\\, and her parents took her to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department\\, the patient described the pain as sharp and rated it at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain was worst in the epigastrium and in the upper quadrants of the abdomen. The temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 105 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 125/66 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

She took ibuprofen on one occasion\\, but the pain subsequently worsened; she decided not to take any additional doses. She did not take any doses of famotidine or ondansetron. One week before the current presentation\\, abdominal pain woke the patient from sleep\\, and her parents took her to the emergency department at the other hospital. The mucous membranes were dry\\, and no abdominal distention or tenderness was noted. The white-cell count was 13\\,000 per microliter and the hemoglobin level 11.4 g per deciliter. Repeat ultrasonography of the abdomen and repeat transabdominal ultrasonography of the pelvis again showed no abnormalities. Screening tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia were negative. The patient was discharged home with instructions to start treatment with famotidine\\, ondansetron\\, and acetaminophen. During the subsequent week\\, episodes of abdominal pain and nausea continued to occur. On the day of the current presentation\\, the episodes of pain lasted 15 minutes\\, and the patient vomited five times. Her parents brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient described the episodes of abdominal pain as severe\\, occurring abruptly\\, and followed by nausea; when vomiting occurred\\, the severity of pain decreased. The pain was not related to menstruation\\, body position\\, time of day\\, or eating or drinking\\, although she noted that she had had decreased appetite. She had had fatigue\\, dizziness\\, and generalized weakness\\, as well as constipation that had worsened during the previous 2 weeks; the last bowel movement had occurred 3 days before the current presentation. There was no fever\\, diarrhea\\, or rash. The patient\u2019s medical history included iron-deficiency anemia and anxiety disorder; she had had pica as a toddler. She had normal growth and development and had received all childhood vaccinations. Medications included iron supplementation\\, oral contraception\\, and famotidine\\, as well as acetaminophen as needed for abdominal pain; she had not started taking ondansetron. She had no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her mother\\, father\\, sister\\, and dog in an urban area of New England. She attended high school. She was sexually active and had had two male partners; she used condoms consistently. She did not drink alcohol\\, use illicit drugs\\, or smoke tobacco; she had last smoked marijuana 4 weeks before the current presentation. Her maternal grandmother had peptic ulcer disease\\, her maternal grandfather had heart disease\\, and her father had depression and anxiety. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 84 beats per minute\\, and the blood pressure 113/78 mm Hg. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The patient was actively retching during the examination. The mucous membranes were moist\\, and bowel sounds were present. The abdomen was nondistended\\, soft\\, and diffusely tender (predominantly in the epigastrium)\\, and there was guarding without rebound. The rectal examination was normal\\, with no palpable stool in the rectal vault. The white-cell count was 15\\,720 per microliter and the hemoglobin level 10.8 g per deciliter. Blood levels of electrolytes\\, glucose\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, alkaline phosphatase\\, and bilirubin were normal\\, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The urine level of human chorionic gonadotropin was less than 6 IU per milliliter (reference range in nonpregnant adults\\, 0 to 6)\\, and urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Ali Pourvaziri: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material and without the administration of oral contrast material\\, showed the gastric contents\\, a normal appendix\\, and no evidence of bowel obstruction. There was a small amount of solid stool in the ascending colon and sigmoid colon. A mixture of aluminum hydroxide\\, diphenhydramine\\, lidocaine\\, magnesium hydroxide\\, and magnesium citrate was administered\\, but the patient vomited after taking these medications.,Trichobezoar"

    "ground_truth_output": "the patient was evaluated for fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 3.5 g per deciliter (reference range\\, 13.5 to 17.5) and a white-cell count of 23\\,450 per microliter (reference range\\, 4000 to 11\\,000)\\, with 81% lymphocytes and 4% blasts. A bone marrow biopsy was performed. Dr. Judith A. Ferry: Examination of the bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed markedly hypercellular marrow with a loss of normal elements. There were sheets of blasts\\, including larger cells with oval-to-irregular nuclei\\, fine chromatin\\, distinct nucleoli\\, and scant cytoplasm\\, as well as more mature-appearing lymphocyte-like blasts with more condensed chromatin. Cytogenetic analysis revealed an abnormal karyotype: 46\\,XY\\,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[15]/46\\,idem\\,t(2;12)(p13;p13)\\,?del(10)(p13)[3]/46\\,idem\\,del(6)(p21)\\,add(7)(p13)[2]. On next-generation sequencing\\, SNaPshot analysis identified a RUNX1 mutation\\, and gene fusion analysis was positive for BCR-ABL1 e13a2. A diagnosis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with BCR-ABL1 was made. FIGURE 1  Initial Bone Marrow\u2013Biopsy Specimen. Dr. Anandappa: Induction chemotherapy with vincristine\\, doxorubicin\\, methotrexate\\, cytarabine\\, and prednisone was administered\\, along with dasatinib and intrathecal cytarabine\\, methotrexate\\, and hydrocortisone. One month later\\, examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed 7% blasts. Treatment with blinatumomab was started\\, and dasatinib was continued. Seven months before this presentation\\, examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed a complete hematologic response. BCR-ABL1 was undetectable by means of reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction testing. Five months before this presentation\\, the patient underwent allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation (HCT) from a matched\\, unrelated donor after myeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation. Early post-transplantation complications included severe mucositis and febrile neutropenia. Two months before this presentation\\, examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed a complete hematologic response\\, no BCR-ABL1 rearrangement\\, and full donor chimerism. Dasatinib was continued as maintenance therapy. During the next 2 months\\, the patient had worsening anemia\\, and dasatinib was stopped. Two days before this presentation\\, the patient noticed \u201clarge black blobs\u201d that looked like shadows in the periphery of the visual fields of both eyes. There were also intermittent episodes of blurry vision in both eyes that resolved after 10 minutes. Two days later\\, the patient sought an evaluation in the oncology clinic of this hospital and was transferred to the emergency department for further evaluation. In the emergency department\\, the patient reported ongoing vision symptoms but no eye pain\\, flashing lights\\, or floaters. He also reported 3 weeks of night sweats\\, areas of swelling in the neck and groin\\, and a pruritic rash on the upper chest\\, upper back\\, and both arms. He had a history of chronic daily migraine headaches\\, which had frequently been associated with eye pain and photophobia but had not been associated with vision changes. Other medical history included depression and obesity. Medications included tacrolimus\\, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole\\, famciclovir\\, omeprazole\\, and escitalopram\\, as well as vitamin D and magnesium supplementation. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a coastal town in New England with his mother. He had previously worked in the food-service industry. He had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs; he drank three cans of beer weekly. His family history included breast cancer and headaches in his maternal grandmother\\, prostate cancer in his paternal grandfather\\, and hypertension in his father. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg\\, the pulse 104 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acuity was 20/25 in both eyes with correction\\, and visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light. There was no proptosis. Slit-lamp examination revealed few cells in the anterior chamber\\, and funduscopic examination was normal. Test results for cranial nerve function\\, strength\\, sensation\\, reflexes\\, coordination\\, and gait were normal. There was palpable lymphadenopathy in the cervical\\, clavicular\\, axillary\\, and inguinal regions. Discrete papules were present on both arms\\, and diffuse xerosis and an eczematous rash were present on the upper back and chest. Laboratory testing revealed a platelet count of 47\\,000 per microliter (reference range\\, 150\\,000 to 400\\,000). Blood testing for cytomegalovirus\\, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)\\, varicella\u2013zoster virus\\, and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA was negative. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus\\, syphilis\\, and Lyme disease was also negative. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear confirmed the presence of anemia and thrombocytopenia; there were no schistocytes. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

T2-weighted\\, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (Figure 2A and 2B) showed multiple new hyperintense lesions\\, measuring up to 11 mm in greatest dimension\\, within the supratentorial and infratentorial regions of the brain. Images obtained after the administration of contrast material showed faint enhancement of the lesions. These foci appeared to be centered within the juxtacortical and periventricular white matter and could reflect areas of demyelination\\, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) involving the central nervous system (CNS)\\, acute lymphoblastic leukemia with CNS involvement\\, or an infectious process. There was no abnormal enhancement of the optic nerves or the orbital structures. FIGURE 2  Imaging Studies Obtained on Admission. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) was also performed. The PET-CT scans (Figure 2C through 2H) showed moderate-to-intense FDG uptake associated with widespread lymphadenopathy\\, including bilateral cervical\\, axillary\\, external iliac\\, and inguinal lymph nodes. There was also abnormal uptake in the spleen. Dr. Anandappa: The patient was admitted to this hospital\\, and lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a total protein level of 147 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 5 to 55) and a glucose level of 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). The white-cell count was 21 per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 5)\\, with 61% lymphocytes\\, 27% neutrophils\\, and 3% eosinophils; the red-cell count was 16\\,000 per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 5)\\, with xanthochromia present. Gram\u2019s staining of cerebrospinal fluid showed a moderate amount of mononuclear cells and no organisms. Cytologic studies were notable for increased lymphocytes and plasma cells.

    "ground_truth_output": "aphasia\\, and a mass lesion in the brain. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current presentation\\, when headache and fatigue developed. The next day\\, she was typing on a computer at her workplace when she suddenly noticed that her typed words were incoherent. The episode of confusion and language production difficulties resolved after a few minutes. Confusion recurred in the evening while the patient was at dinner with her husband\\, and she sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Examination was reportedly normal. Dr. Jeremy N. Ford: Computed tomography (CT) of the head\\, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material\\, and CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed a large area of attenuation in the left posterior superior frontal lobe. Dr. Alves: The patient was admitted to the other hospital. Dr. Ford: On hospital day 2\\, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1)\\, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material\\, revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left frontal lobe with vasogenic edema and mass effect. A diagnosis of cancer with metastases to the brain was considered\\, and additional imaging studies were obtained. CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis\\, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material\\, reportedly showed a pulmonary nodule that measured 0.2 cm in diameter and a nodule in the right breast that measured 1.3 cm in diameter. The appearance of the breast nodule was unchanged from that observed on imaging performed 8 years before the current presentation\\, except for the presence of a new punctate calcification along the anterior margin. FIGURE 1  MRI of the Head Obtained on Hospital Day 2. On hospital day 3\\, expressive aphasia developed. CT of the head\\, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material\\, reportedly showed increased edema and mass effect that corresponded to the abnormality in the left frontal lobe. Dr. Alves: Treatment with dexamethasone and levetiracetam was started. The patient received one dose of each medication before she was transferred to the neurosurgical unit of this hospital for evaluation and possible brain biopsy. The patient had a history of myasthenia gravis\\, vitamin B12 deficiency\\, and hypertension. Surgical history included supracervical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine fibroids (performed 31 years before the current presentation)\\, transsternal thymectomy and wedge resection of the right upper lobe for a cortical thymoma (22 years before the current presentation)\\, and sigmoid colectomy for recurrent diverticulitis (7 years before the current presentation). Ocular-predominant myasthenia gravis was diagnosed 18 years before the current presentation and 4 years after thymectomy. Myasthenia gravis had been treated for 11 years with cyclosporine and pyridostigmine. Seven years before the current presentation\\, a flare of myasthenia gravis was complicated by respiratory failure\\, for which the patient received bilevel positive airway pressure and underwent plasmapheresis. After that hospitalization\\, cyclosporine therapy was replaced by mycophenolate mofetil\\, which she had been taking daily for the past 7 years. Other medications included cholecalciferol\\, latanoprost ophthalmic drops\\, hydrochlorothiazide\\, polysaccharide\u2013iron complex capsules\\, and monthly intramuscular vitamin B12 injections. Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate had previously caused rash. The patient lived in the northeastern United States\\, was married\\, and worked in an office. She had recently traveled to California for a wedding\\, and she reported no exposures to animals or fresh water. She had not had any recent dental procedures. She had no history of tobacco use or injection drug use. She rarely consumed alcoholic beverages. Her mother had systemic lupus erythematosus\\, and her father had lung cancer. A sister had rheumatoid arthritis. On examination\\, the oral temperature was 36.6\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 150/80 mm Hg\\, the pulse 91 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Severe expressive aphasia was observed\\, and she followed commands intermittently. Orientation could not be accurately assessed. She had disconjugate gaze at rest. Motor strength was 5/5 in the left arm and left leg and 4/5 in the right arm and right leg. The blood level of glucose was normal\\, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of phosphorus was 2.2 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 2.6 to 4.5). The complete blood count was normal\\, as were the results of tests of coagulation. Electroencephalography showed intermittent irregular delta slowing focally over the left frontal region but no epileptiform abnormalities. CT of the head\\, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material\\, revealed ill-defined parenchymal hypoattenuation involving the left superior frontal gyrus\\, left middle frontal gyrus\\, and left centrum semiovale with associated sulcal effacement. Treatment with dexamethasone\\, hydrochlorothiazide\\, mycophenolate mofetil\\, and pyridostigmine was stopped\\, as was treatment with cholecalciferol\\, latanoprost drops\\, polysaccharide\u2013iron complex\\, and vitamin B12. Treatment with levetiracetam was continued\\, and empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin was started. Dr. Gavin P. Dunn: A left frontal craniotomy with open brain biopsy was planned to allow for sufficient lesional tissue to be obtained and to enable further debulking to be performed\\, pending intraoperative findings and the results of pathological assessment. A small craniotomy centered at the coronal suture directly over the target lesion was performed. The lesion appeared gray\\, and tissue that appeared abnormal was sampled in several locations of the lesion. Direct microscopic visualization of the specimens identified areas that did not appear to be completely distinct from normal tissue\\, and thus\\, further debulking was not indicated. No purulence was noted. Dr. Christopher W. Mount: Intraoperative examination of a frozen section (Figure 2) revealed a cellular infiltrate consisting of atypical cells in a focal perivascular arrangement. No evidence of pathologically significant acute inflammation was present in the tissue. At this time\\, these features suggested the presence of a malignant infiltrate. Additional specimens were submitted to the pathology department for formalin fixation and interpretation. FIGURE 2  Frozen Section of Brain Tissue. Dr. Alves: A diagnosis of lymphoma was considered\\, and treatment with dexamethasone administered intravenously every 6 hours was started. On postoperative day 1\\, new facial droop on the right side developed\\, along with weakness with cervical flexion and monoplegia of the right arm. Dr. Ford: Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 3)\\, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material\\, revealed postsurgical changes in the left frontal lobe and susceptibility artifact at the biopsy site that was consistent with blood products. There was enlargement of the expansile lesion in the left frontal lobe that corresponded to an area of hyperintensity on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a large volume of ascitic fluid and scattered areas of high-density material. Paracentesis was performed\\, and 1300 ml of ascitic fluid was removed. Analysis of the ascitic fluid was notable for more than 1000 red cells per microliter\\, 2099 nucleated cells per microliter (with 400 neutrophils per microliter)\\, and numerous atypical cells that were not further characterized. Blood and ascitic fluid specimens were obtained for culture. On the second hospital day\\, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital because of concern for sepsis. She reported persistent fatigue\\, weakness\\, myalgias\\, and watery diarrhea. Additional history was obtained. Twenty-two months before this admission\\, the patient had been admitted to the other hospital because of abnormal results on liver-function tests. She had received a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis complicated by cirrhosis with ascites. Treatment with a short course of prednisone had been initiated\\, furosemide administered\\, and large-volume paracentesis performed for the management of ascites. The patient had been advised to discontinue alcohol consumption. Ten months later\\, and 12 months before the current admission\\, the patient had been admitted to this hospital because of decompensated liver disease complicated by hepatorenal syndrome. Renal replacement therapy had been initiated\\, and small-volume paracentesis had been performed to obtain ascitic fluid for cytologic and hematologic analysis. Dr. Robert P. Hasserjian: Analysis of the ascitic fluid performed 12 months before the current admission had been notable for 44 nucleated cells per microliter\\, of which 1% were lymphocytes\\, 53% monocytes\\, 17% macrophages\\, and 29% atypical-appearing plasma cells (Figure 1A). These findings had prompted flow cytometric analysis of the ascitic fluid\\, which had revealed a clonal plasma cell population with lambda light-chain restriction (Figure 1B) but no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population. FIGURE 1  Ascitic Fluid Specimen Obtained before Transplantation. Dr. Roberts: Twelve months before the current admission\\, the serum IgG level had been 1394 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 614 to 1295)\\, the IgA level 885 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 69 to 309)\\, and the IgM level 177 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 53 to 334). Serum protein electrophoresis had revealed a diffuse increase in the gamma globulin level in a normal pattern; no monoclonal protein had been detected on immunofixation. The serum level of free kappa light chains had been 246.2 mg per liter (reference range\\, 3.3 to 19.4) and the level of free lambda light chains 78.4 mg per liter (reference range\\, 5.7 to 26.3)\\, with a kappa:lambda ratio of 3.14 (reference range\\, 0.26 to 1.65). A bone marrow biopsy had been performed\\, and analysis of the bone marrow had revealed 5% plasma cells\\, which were polytypic for kappa and lambda light chains on in situ hybridization. Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow had revealed no clonal plasma cells or abnormal lymphocytes. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis had revealed a cirrhotic liver with evidence of portal hypertension\\, including abdominal varices and ascites\\, but no focal masses or lymphadenopathy. Taken together\\, these findings had been considered to be due to liver disease\\, an inflammatory state\\, and kidney dysfunction\\, and the patient had been listed for liver transplantation. Ten months before the current admission\\, orthotopic liver transplantation had been performed. Pretransplantation testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) IgG and cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG had been positive in both the donor and the recipient. The explanted native liver had shown micronodular cirrhosis with mildly inflamed septa and evidence of iron overload. The immediate post-transplantation course had been notable for intraperitoneal hemorrhage\\, as well as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and recurrent peritonitis. The patient had been discharged to a rehabilitation facility 21 days after transplantation. Three months after liver transplantation\\, and 7 months before the current admission\\, biliary stent obstruction and multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia had developed. The biliary stent had been removed and intravenous antibiotic agents administered. Four months before the current admission\\, asymptomatic CMV viremia had developed. Outpatient treatment with valganciclovir had been initiated. The patient had remained well until the current admission. At the time of the current admission\\, medications included aspirin\\, atovaquone\\, vitamin B complex\\, calcium citrate\\, vitamin D3\\, ferrous sulfate\\, fludrocortisone\\, gabapentin\\, magnesium\\, melatonin\\, mycophenolate\\, omeprazole\\, prednisone\\, tacrolimus\\, and ursodiol. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in New England and lived with her mother. She had not traveled outside the region\\, and there had been no animal exposures. The patient had stopped drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes approximately 2 years before the current admission. There was no illicit drug use. Her mother and father both had cardiac and liver disease; her maternal grandfather also had liver disease. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 100/53 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 114 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21. The patient appeared thin and frail. An abdominal examination revealed moderate distention\\, shifting dullness\\, and softness without tenderness. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with intravenous cefepime and linezolid and oral vancomycin was initiated\\, and intravenous fluids were continued. Blood\\, urine\\, and stool specimens were obtained for culture. Dr. Mark A. Anderson: PET-CT of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis revealed multifocal\\, predominantly peritoneal FDG-avid masses\\, as well as diffuse FDG uptake along the surface of large-bowel and small-bowel loops (Figure 2). These findings had not been present on a CT scan obtained 1 year earlier. FIGURE 2  Abdominal Images. Dr. Roberts: Testing for Clostridioides difficile toxin in stool was positive. Treatment with intravenous antibiotics was stopped\\, and oral vancomycin was continued. The diarrhea abated\\, and the hypotension resolved. On the third hospital day\\, the blood creatinine level decreased to 2.25 mg per deciliter (199 \u03bcmol per liter); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood\\, urine\\, and stool cultures were negative. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed\\, and analysis of the ascitic fluid was notable for 2018 nucleated cells per microliter\\, of which 30% were unclassified; additional results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed.,Plasma cell myeloma (multiple myeloma)."

    "ground_truth_output": "an episode of lightheadedness occurred when the patient stood up from a seated position. The episode was associated with diaphoresis and mild nausea; it lasted for a few minutes and resolved spontaneously. Four days later\\, another episode of lightheadedness occurred\\, and the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. The temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 147/80 mm Hg\\, the pulse 109 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Swelling of the wrists and ankles was present. The blood levels of glucose and electrolytes and the results of kidney-function tests were normal. The aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were normal; the alkaline phosphatase level was 157 U per liter (reference range\\, 45 to 115). The complete blood count with differential count was normal\\, as was the urinalysis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 104 mm per hour (reference range\\, 0 to 14)\\, the C-reactive protein level 6.3 mg per liter (reference value\\, <8.0)\\, and the d-dimer level 990 ng per milliliter (reference value\\, <500). An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material timed to evaluate the pulmonary arteries\\, showed no pulmonary embolus or pulmonary nodules; there was no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Intravenous crystalloid solution was administered\\, and the lightheadedness resolved. Plans were made for an evaluation of the joint swelling and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the rheumatology clinic affiliated with this hospital. The patient was discharged home. Three days later\\, the patient was seen in the rheumatology clinic. Additional history was obtained. Four months before the current presentation\\, mild coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) had developed after the patient had returned from a vacation in Central America and the Caribbean. Symptoms associated with Covid-19 resolved after 5 days. One week after the resolution of symptoms\\, and 14 weeks before the current presentation\\, pain and swelling of the wrists had developed. There was morning stiffness in both wrists and difficulty with forming a fist; the stiffness abated with activity and hot showers. The patient had had a partial response after the administration of topical diclofenac\\, acetaminophen\\, and plant-based topical applications for joint pain. He also had noted a sensation of instability in the ankles occurring toward the end of the day. In addition to the joint symptoms\\, a rash involving the chest\\, back\\, and legs had developed; the palms and soles were spared. The rash was mildly pruritic at night and nonpainful. Alopecia\\, anorexia\\, and an estimated 8 kg of weight loss had also occurred. Two weeks before the current presentation\\, nasal crusting had developed\\, and the patient had noted the presence of scant blood when using facial tissue. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for asthma and eczema. Medications included topical triamcinolone and topical hydrocortisone. An unspecified allergy to diphenhydramine had been reported previously. The patient lived in Boston and worked in an office. He smoked a half pack of cigarettes and consumed two alcoholic beverages daily. There was no history of illicit drug use. He was sexually active with men; his most recent sexual activity\\, with a new partner\\, had occurred 5 months before the current presentation. His family history included psoriasis in his grandmother. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 156/90 mm Hg\\, the pulse 105 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Multiple small areas of alopecia were scattered throughout the scalp\\, and there was crusting in the distal nares. The left commissure of the mouth had an ulcerative lesion; there was no evidence of mucosal lesions or cervical lymphadenopathy. Swelling\\, warmth\\, and mild tenderness of the wrists and ankles were present. Swelling of several metacarpophalangeal joints was also present. There was a hyperpigmented\\, macular rash with scaling that involved the trunk (Figure 1)\\, back\\, and legs\\, extending to the dorsal aspect of the feet. The heart rate was tachycardic but regular\\, without murmurs. The remainder of the examination was normal. FIGURE 1  Clinical Photograph. Diagnostic tests were performed.,Secondary syphilis."

    "ground_truth_output": "Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital): A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of rapidly progressive weakness in the right arm and recurrent falls. Twelve years before this admission\\, the patient noted worsening gait and balance disturbance\\, which slowly progressed\\, and falls began to occur 5 years before this admission. Her medical history included measles encephalitis\\, which had been diagnosed when she was 6 years of age and had resulted in weakness on the left side\\, severe vision and hearing impairment\\, and gait and balance disturbance. After rehabilitation therapy\\, her balance and gait apparently normalized\\, but she had mild residual weakness on the left side\\, which resulted in a change from left-hand to right-hand dominance. Two years before this admission\\, the patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She reported difficulties with balance\\, which worsened with head turning. She reported no disequilibrium\\, vertigo\\, back pain\\, paresthesia\\, or numbness. On examination\\, her cognitive function was intact\\, and although her speech was dysarthric and hypophonic\\, these abnormalities could have been associated with her hearing loss. The cranial-nerve examination revealed abnormal eye movements\\, with square-wave jerks\\, saccadic pursuit\\, and bilateral horizontal nystagmus. The hearing and vision were severely reduced. The muscle bulk was decreased throughout\\, and tone was normal. Motor strength was full and symmetric in the arms and legs bilaterally\\, and contractures were present in the fingers of the left hand. Reflexes were reduced or absent throughout\\, and plantar reflexes were extensor bilaterally. Vibratory sensation was reduced at the great toes but was otherwise normal. The patient had appendicular dysmetria on both finger-to-nose testing and heel-to-shin testing that was greater on the left side than on the right side. Her gait was wide-based\\, and she was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg sign was present. Needle electromyographic findings and the results of nerve-conduction studies were normal\\, as were findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine revealed mild multilevel degenerative disk disease without clinically significant spinal-canal stenosis. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 0 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range\\, 0 to 5)\\, and oligoclonal bands were absent. Tests of the CSF and serum for antibodies associated with autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis were negative (Table 1). The patient underwent physical therapy\\, and her symptoms stabilized.

The patient initially attributed the weakness to fatigue\\, since it had occurred during a time of increased physical activity associated with moving to a different apartment. However\\, the weakness did not abate\\, and 2 months before this admission\\, she was again evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She noted difficulty with communicating in sign language and with holding objects in her right hand because of weakness and had started using her left hand to eat. She reported no neck\\, arm\\, or leg pain and no sensory loss. Her gait and balance were stable\\, with no recent falls. On examination\\, there was reduced facial expression and reduced muscle bulk and tone throughout. The right shoulder was dropped\\, with weakness in the right trapezius and reduced active shoulder abduction that was limited to 70 degrees\\, without pain on shoulder abduction. There was predominantly proximal weakness in the right arm; the muscle strength was 4\u2212/5 on shoulder abduction and external rotation\\, 4+/5 on elbow flexion\\, and 4/5 on elbow extension\\, wrist extension\\, and abductor digiti minimi and finger extension. The strength in the right leg was normal. There was subtle weakness on the left side that involved wrist and finger extension and great toe extension. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right biceps and 1+ at the left biceps and were otherwise areflexic throughout. Sensation was intact in the arms\\, but there was decreased vibratory sensation and proprioception at the great toes; sensation was otherwise normal. Moderate appendicular dysmetria was present in the arms and legs. The patient\u2019s gait\\, which was assessed while she was using her white cane (the type of cane commonly used by blind or visually impaired persons)\\, was wide-based; she took excessively large steps and reached out once to touch the wall. Neurologic examination was otherwise unchanged from the examination performed 2 years earlier. Additional studies were obtained. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: MRI of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, was reported to be normal. MRI of the cervical spine was also performed without the administration of contrast material; T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed signal hyperintensity in the suboccipital and paraspinal soft tissues that was consistent with edema. Areas of intrinsic hyperintense signal that were consistent with fatty atrophy were seen on T1-weighted imaging. There were diffuse degenerative changes with mild spinal-canal stenosis at C4\u2013C5\\, without cord compression. Dr. Avetisyan: Repeat needle electromyography revealed no recorded motor units in the right deltoid or infraspinatus muscles\\, with complex repetitive discharges in the right cervical paraspinal and deltoid muscles. Nerve-conduction studies revealed mild reduction in the amplitudes of the bilateral median and right ulnar sensory responses; the sensory responses of the right radial\\, bilateral antebrachial cutaneous\\, and bilateral medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves were normal\\, as were the motor responses of the right median and right ulnar nerves. During the ensuing 2 months\\, the weakness in the right arm progressed rapidly\\, which caused the patient to have difficulty ambulating with her white cane (she was unable to walk with a standard cane)\\, making walking unsafe after frequent falls and rendering her practically bedbound. She had no pain or numbness in her arm. She was ultimately unable to care for herself at home and was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation. Other medical history included hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism. Medications included ascorbic acid\\, vitamin B complex\\, coenzyme Q10\\, vitamin E\\, calcium carbonate and cholecalciferol\\, and levothyroxine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone and worked for a nonprofit agency. She was a lifelong nonsmoker\\, drank four glasses of wine per week\\, and did not use illicit drugs. She reported that her father had died from Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease when he was 71 years of age\\, 7 months after the onset of symptoms. Her mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease\\, which was diagnosed when she was in her 60s; she was currently living in a nursing home. The patient had four siblings; one had died at 46 years of age from an intracerebral hemorrhage\\, and her remaining three siblings were well. On examination\\, the temperature was 35.7\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 116/64 mm Hg\\, the pulse 61 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 15.8. The patient appeared emaciated but was able to sit up in a chair and hold her head up. Strength in her right arm had decreased to 2/5 on shoulder shrug\\, shoulder abduction\\, elbow flexion\\, and elbow extension\\, with 3/5 strength on wrist extension and finger flexion and extension. There was new proximal weakness in the right leg\\, with 4/5 strength on right hip flexion. The strength in the left arm was unchanged. Deep-tendon reflexes were 3+ at the right biceps and 2+ at the brachioradialis and were otherwise absent throughout. She had ataxia as well as occasional jerks that involved the legs (with the left leg affected to a greater extent than the right leg) and were possibly stimulus-induced. The remainder of the neurologic examination was unchanged from the last visit. Dr. Schaefer: MRI of the head\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a new linear signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging but also a marked decrease in subtle restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging and hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging (identified in retrospect on the previous MRI) in the left frontal and left parietal lobes (Figure 1). MRI of the whole spine\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, was unchanged from previous imaging. FIGURE 1  MRI of the Head. Dr. Avetisyan: The creatine kinase level was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed.,Genetic Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease."

    "ground_truth_output": "daily fever with a temperature of up to 38.9\u00b0C\\, chills\\, myalgias\\, drenching night sweats\\, and pressure and pain in both cheeks and ears developed. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported rhinorrhea and fatigue but no headache\\, pharyngitis\\, or dyspnea\\, and he had no sick contacts. On examination\\, the temperature was 37.8\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 100 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 112/64 mm Hg\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was ill-appearing\\, and the maxillary sinuses were tender on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes\\, calcium\\, total protein\\, albumin\\, and globulin were normal\\, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 463\\,000 per microliter (reference range\\, 140\\,000 to 400\\,000); the remainder of the complete blood count and the differential count were normal. Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was prescribed. During the next 2 weeks\\, fever\\, night sweats\\, and sinus and facial pain continued. Diffuse headache developed\\, along with jaw soreness\\, scalp tenderness\\, and hip and shoulder stiffness. The patient was evaluated again by his primary care physician. He reported weight loss of 2 kg\\, episodic double vision\\, and hip pain that caused difficulty in standing and climbing stairs. The physical examination was unchanged. Urinalysis was normal. A test for heterophile antibody and an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative\\, as were screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus and Lyme disease. Chest radiography and computed tomography of the sinuses were normal. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist at another hospital. On evaluation\\, the patient reported persistent fever and frontal\\, temporal\\, and maxillary headache. There were palpable temporal artery pulses without tenderness; the remainder of the examination was normal\\, including the absence of bruits on auscultation of large vessels. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 108 mm per hour (reference range\\, 0 to 20)\\, the blood level of C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg per liter (reference value\\, <8.0)\\, the blood level of rheumatoid factor 24 IU per milliliter (reference value\\, <14)\\, and the blood level of aldolase 8.4 IU per milliliter (reference value\\, <8.1). Biopsy of the right temporal artery was performed. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed no granulomas\\, but evidence of chronic inflammation of the temporal artery and fibrinoid necrosis of an adjacent small vessel were noted. A diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis was made\\, and treatment with prednisone was started. Within a few days after initiation of treatment\\, headache\\, fever\\, jaw pain\\, and joint stiffness abated. The next month\\, an attempt to lower the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent severe headache with scalp tenderness\\, jaw pain\\, and hip stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 84 mg per liter. Treatment with weekly subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab was initiated. During the next 6 weeks\\, another attempt was made to taper the prednisone dose. After 1 week of treatment at a lower prednisone dose\\, and 5 months after the development of initial symptoms (5 months before the current evaluation)\\, the patient reported headache that he described as \u201cthe worst headache of my life\\,\u201d with associated jaw pain and diplopia. The pain was worst at the right frontal and maxillary areas\\, but the entire right side of the face\\, including the scalp and neck\\, was affected. The patient returned to the other hospital for evaluation. He was found to have palsies of the third and sixth cranial nerves on the right side. The patient was admitted to the neurology service at the other hospital. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing revealed a slightly elevated myeloperoxidase antibody level\\, at 1.9 U (reference value\\, <1.0)\\, but antibodies to proteinase 3 were not detected. Blood levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Otto Rapalino: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A and 1B)\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed abnormal expansion and enhancement of the right cavernous sinus that extended into the right superior orbital fissure and right pterygopalatine fossa\\, as well as abnormal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement of the adjacent right middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Figure 1C and 1D) showed masslike pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement in the upper cervical spinal canal at C2\u2013C4 with an anterior predominance as well as more circumferentially at the cervicothoracic junction (C6\u2013T3) with a posterior predominance\\, with resultant canal narrowing and mild cord compression at C7\u2013T2. There was no spinal cord edema. FIGURE 1  MRI of the Head and Spine Obtained 5 Months before the Current Evaluation. Dr. John Stone: A lumbar puncture was performed; an opening pressure was not recorded. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose level was 65 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 50 to 80 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.4 mmol per liter])\\, and the protein level was 126 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 15 to 45)\\, with 2 red cells per microliter and 8 white cells per microliter (of which 79% were lymphocytes). Gram\u2019s staining and cultures of the CSF were negative. Tests for CSF myelin basic protein\\, angiotensin-converting enzyme\\, cryptococcal antigen\\, cysticercosis IgG\\, mycobacterial DNA\\, Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA\\, and borrelia DNA were negative\\, as was a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. Cytologic analysis of the CSF showed a mixed population of mononuclear cells with rare plasma cells. The CSF immunoglobulin level was 19 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 0 to 6)\\, with 5 oligoclonal bands. On the eighth hospital day\\, a meningeal biopsy was performed. Treatment with high-dose prednisone was started\\, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 2 weeks\\, the patient continued taking the prednisone\\, but the facial and head pain worsened. He was readmitted to the other hospital to receive 3 days of treatment with parenteral pulse-dose methylprednisolone. Pathological examination of the meningeal biopsy specimen revealed a densely fibrotic\\, chronically inflamed dura mater with large numbers of CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ T lymphocytes and with focal collections of CD20+ B lymphocytes. There was a large number of polyclonal plasma cells with more than 100 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-power field. Storiform fibrosis was present\\, and elastin staining revealed obliterative venulitis. Some of the inflammatory foci were angiocentric\\, but no vasculitis was present. There were rare foci of fibrinoid necrosis and some neutrophils\\, with rare giant cells but no granulomas. A diagnosis of IgG4-related disease was made\\, and rituximab was administered. Two days after the first rituximab dose\\, a pulmonary embolism was diagnosed\\, and treatment with apixaban was initiated. Two weeks later\\, repeat imaging was obtained to evaluate the treatment response. Dr. Rapalino: Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 2A and 2B)\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed increased abnormal enhancement in the right cavernous sinus and right middle cranial fossa and new abnormal enhancement in the left cavernous sinus and adjacent left middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Figure 2C and 2D) also showed progression in the extent and thickness of the ventral and dorsal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement. There was also progression of the canal stenosis\\, which had become severe\\, and cord compression at the C7 level. There was no cord signal abnormality. FIGURE 2  MRI of the Head and Spine Obtained 4 Months before the Current Evaluation. Dr. John Stone: The patient received a second infusion of rituximab\\, as well as treatment with oral dexamethasone. Three weeks later\\, and 7 months after the development of initial symptoms (3 months before the current evaluation)\\, the patient was admitted to the other hospital because of worsening headache\\, nausea\\, and vomiting. Examination was notable for new sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and deviation of the tongue to the left. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Treatment with dexamethasone was continued\\, and the patient was discharged home. Three weeks after placement of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt\\, the patient was admitted again to the other hospital because of streptococcal infection. Two months after discharge\\, and 10 months after the development of initial symptoms\\, he was seen in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation. The patient had a history of migraines\\, hypertension\\, and a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. Medications included apixaban\\, baclofen\\, dexamethasone\\, furosemide\\, gabapentin\\, lisinopril\\, and metoprolol. He was a retired businessman and lived with his wife. He drank one glass of wine weekly and had quit smoking more than 40 years before the current evaluation. His maternal grandfather had died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm. The temperature was 36.5\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 88 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 118/79 mm Hg\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The scalp hair was thin. He had cushingoid facies; acne on the face\\, back\\, and chest; striae on the flanks; and proximal muscle weakness of the arms and legs. There was no scalp or temporal tenderness. He had no tongue lesions or oral ulcers\\, and the nasal examination showed no crusting. Extraocular movements were intact. There was no arthritis. The chest\\, abdominal\\, and neurologic examinations were normal. The complete blood count and the differential count were normal\\, as was a urinalysis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 52 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 5 mg per liter. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed an IgM level of 22 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 53 to 334) and normal levels of IgG and IgA. ANCA testing was negative. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.,Granulomatosis with polyangiitis."

    "user_input": "Dr. Man Piu Wong: A 55-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital after a witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The patient had been eating at a restaurant late at night when he lost consciousness. A first responder used an automated external defibrillator to deliver a shock\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. Four minutes later\\, emergency medical services identified ventricular fibrillation\\, and defibrillation was performed. Intravenous amiodarone and epinephrine and intranasal naloxone were administered. Unstable ventricular tachycardia occurred\\, and the patient underwent cardioversion. He was transported to the emergency department of this hospital. The results of electrocardiography (ECG) performed before arrival at the hospital were suggestive of inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. A review of systems could not be performed. The patient had no known medical history. He was not known to take any medications. He reportedly lived alone\\, worked in the service industry\\, and did not use tobacco or drink alcohol. His family history was unknown. On the patient\u2019s arrival at the emergency department\\, the heart rate was 123 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 188/107 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 88% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a bag\u2013valve\u2013mask device at a rate of 15 liters per minute. The weight was 73 kg\\, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.0. The patient was awake but not oriented. He did not spontaneously move the arms or legs or respond to tactile stimuli; he had increased work of breathing and posturing. The pupils were 3 mm in diameter and sluggishly reactive. Auscultation revealed sinus tachycardia and diffuse lung crackles. There was no leg edema. The remainder of the examination was normal. Dr. Ada C. Stefanescu Schmidt: ECG showed sinus tachycardia\\, Q waves and 2-mm ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads\\, and upsloping ST-segment depressions in the lateral and precordial leads (Figure 1A). FIGURE 1  Initial Cardiopulmonary Diagnostic Studies. Dr. Wong: Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The white-cell count and differential count were normal\\, as were the levels of magnesium\\, bilirubin\\, and globulin. The high-sensitivity troponin T level was 3169 ng per liter (reference range\\, 0 to 14)\\, and the N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level was 5679 pg per milliliter (reference value\\, <900).

Bedside ultrasonography revealed bilateral lung sliding and reduced left ventricular function. The trachea was intubated\\, and the oxygen saturation was 88% while the patient was receiving mechanical ventilation on a volume-controlled mode (tidal volume\\, 440 ml; respiratory rate\\, 20 breaths per minute; positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]\\, 14 cm of water; fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio2]\\, 1.0). Dr. Milena Petranovic: Portable chest radiography (Figure 1B) revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette\\, as well as diffuse interstitial opacities in both lungs and an asymmetric consolidation in the right upper lobe. Endotracheal and enteric tubes were in appropriate positions\\, and multiple metallic densities related to a previous gunshot injury were projected over the left hemithorax. Dr. Stefanescu Schmidt: Unstable ventricular tachycardia recurred\\, and defibrillation was performed. Emergency cardiac catheterization was performed\\, and a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was placed through the right femoral artery. Coronary angiography (Figure 1C) revealed a thrombotic occlusion of the right coronary artery\\, as well as 60 to 70% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and a diagonal branch. The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 34 mm Hg. Intraprocedural transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed a dilated\\, hypokinetic left ventricle with akinesis of the inferior and septal walls. Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation were present\\, and there was no pericardial effusion. The thrombosis of the right coronary artery was difficult to wire and cross. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was undertaken with the use of two drug-eluting stents in the middle and distal portions of the right coronary artery. Ventricular tachycardia recurred before reperfusion\\, and the patient underwent two cardioversions. Intravenous cangrelor\\, heparin\\, amiodarone\\, vancomycin\\, and cefepime were administered. Data from pulmonary artery catheterization\\, performed after PCI\\, are shown in Table 2. After the initiation of treatment with the percutaneous LVAD and reperfusion of the right coronary artery\\, the patient received low-dose norepinephrine.

The temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 98 beats per minute\\, and the blood pressure 81/72 mm Hg while he was receiving intravenous norepinephrine at a rate of 4 \u03bcg per minute and maximal support from the percutaneous LVAD. The oxygen saturation was 92% while he was receiving mechanical ventilation on a volume-controlled mode. The heart sounds were tachycardic and distant and were obscured by the mechanical hum of the LVAD. There was bleeding at the site of the right femoral arteriotomy. The arms and legs were cool. When sedation was temporarily discontinued\\, the pupils were sluggishly reactive\\, without corneal reflexes or blinking in response to threat; there was no response to noxious stimuli\\, and the plantar reflexes were mute. A screening test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was positive\\, and intravenous dexamethasone and remdesivir were administered. Aspirin was also administered. Results from laboratory testing and hemodynamic monitoring are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. The protocol for temperature management after cardiac arrest was initiated. Dr. Petranovic: Chest radiography showed that the endotracheal tube\\, cardiac catheter\\, percutaneous LVAD\\, and enteric tube were in appropriate positions. There were diffuse alveolar opacities\\, which were greater on the left side than the right side\\, as well as a left pleural effusion. Dr. Wong: During the 6 hours after admission to the cardiac intensive care unit\\, the blood pressure decreased to 74/72 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous norepinephrine at a rate of 9 \u03bcg per minute and maximal support from the percutaneous LVAD. The urine output decreased\\, and the cardiac index measured by means of thermodilution was 1.7 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area; other results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.

He thought the fatigue was associated with alcohol consumption and reduced his intake to 12 beers weekly; before this\\, he had consumed 24 beers weekly for 15 years. Three months before the current admission\\, the patient\u2019s weight had decreased by 9.1 kg. However\\, 3 weeks before this admission\\, the weight had increased by 9.6 kg and swelling developed in both legs. He thought the weight gain was related to diet changes\\, including consumption of pizza\\, pasta\\, and soup\\, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. One week before the current admission\\, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He was instructed to elevate his legs\\, wear compression stockings\\, and decrease dietary sodium to 2 g daily. On the day of the current admission\\, the leg swelling had not abated and new abdominal distention occurred. He called the primary care clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation\\, a review of systems was notable for fatigue\\, lethargy\\, decreased appetite\\, abdominal bloating\\, constipation\\, penile swelling\\, decreased libido\\, intolerance of cold temperatures\\, and ankle and knee pain in both legs that was worse when the patient was climbing stairs. There was no fever\\, shortness of breath\\, chest pain\\, or hematochezia. Sixteen months before the current evaluation\\, the patient had been admitted to this hospital with pneumonia involving the right upper and middle lobes that was due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. During that admission\\, he received diagnoses of diabetes and normocytic anemia. After discharge from the hospital\\, laboratory evaluation revealed a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.1% (reference range\\, 4.3 to 6.4). Metformin was prescribed\\, and follow-up evaluation was recommended; however\\, the patient had not returned to the primary care clinic before the current illness. The patient had not started taking metformin until 3 weeks before the current evaluation; he took no other medications and had no known drug allergies.

On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 100/56 mm Hg\\, the pulse 103 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 42 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He was alert and oriented but appeared ill. He had increased work of breathing\\, with the use of accessory muscles of respiration; diffuse rales were heard in both lungs. There was no abdominal tenderness\\, hepatosplenomegaly\\, asterixis\\, or leg swelling. Marked scleral icterus and jaundiced skin were present\\, but he had no conjunctival suffusion\\, rash\\, or ulcers. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Ryan Chung: Radiography of the chest revealed bilateral\\, predominantly peripheral\\, patchy opacities (Figure 1A). Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed hyperechogenic and prominent portal triads with a \u201cstarry sky\u201d appearance; there was no biliary ductal dilatation or hydronephrosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities with tree-in-bud nodularity in both lungs (Figure 1B and 1C)\\, as well as small pleural effusions and enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes (Figure 1D). No hepatic lesions\\, biliary ductal dilatation\\, or hepatosplenomegaly were noted (Figure 1E). FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies of the Chest\\, Abdomen\\, and Pelvis. Dr. Crabtree: The patient started treatment with continuous positive airway pressure. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime and oral doxycycline was administered. A diagnostic test was performed.,Icteric leptospirosis."

    "user_input": "Dr. Margaret R. Connolly (Surgery): A 15-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and an ovarian mass. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 6 weeks before the current presentation\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "when lower abdominal pain developed along the midline. The pain was sharp and crampy\\, increased with movement\\, and decreased with lying down. During the next 24 hours\\, the pain shifted from the midline to the right side. The patient was taken to the emergency department of a hospital affiliated with this hospital for evaluation. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 125/82 mm Hg\\, the pulse 102 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The lower abdomen had mild tenderness that was present on both sides but was greater on the right side. The abdomen was soft and nondistended. Bowel sounds were normal\\, and there was no rebound\\, guarding\\, or tenderness at the costovertebral angle. The white-cell count was 14\\,270 per microliter (reference range\\, 4500 to 13\\,500) and the hemoglobin level 10.9 g per deciliter (reference range\\, 12.0 to 16.0). Blood levels of electrolytes\\, glucose\\, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal\\, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The urinalysis was normal. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were performed. TABLE 1  Laboratory Data.

There were multiple follicular cysts\\, measuring up to 1.7 cm in diameter\\, in the left ovary. Doppler flow was normal in both ovaries. There was a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. The appendix was not visualized. Dr. Connolly: Acetaminophen\\, ketorolac\\, and intravenous fluids were administered. A diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst was considered\\, and the patient was discharged home with plans to undergo repeat transabdominal ultrasonography 6 weeks later. After the patient was discharged from the emergency department\\, the abdominal pain slowly resolved. Three days after discharge\\, the patient resumed competitive long-distance running. Five weeks later\\, and 4 days before the current presentation\\, she participated in a running competition. The next day\\, abdominal pain recurred\\, and the patient was unable to go to school. She took ibuprofen\\, but it did not alleviate the pain. She was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient reported that the current episode of abdominal pain was similar to the episode that had occurred 6 weeks earlier. She had no fever\\, chills\\, night sweats\\, nausea\\, vomiting\\, anorexia\\, dysuria\\, hematuria\\, frequent urination\\, or vaginal bleeding or discharge. She had noticed an increase in her waist size during the past 2 weeks and had difficulty fitting into her pants. The patient had no notable medical history. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She had normal growth and development; menarche had not occurred. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. The patient lived in suburban New England with her parents and sister. She was not sexually active and did not smoke tobacco\\, drink alcohol\\, or use illicit drugs. Her parents and sister were healthy; menarche had occurred in her mother and sister when they were each 12 years of age. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 141/89 mm Hg\\, and the pulse 95 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.7. The right lower abdomen was firm and distended\\, with mild tenderness. Bowel sounds were normal\\, and there was no rebound\\, guarding\\, or evidence of a discrete mass or hepatosplenomegaly on palpation. Development of pubic hair and breasts was classified as Tanner stage 4 (with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development). The white-cell count was 16\\,120 per microliter and the hemoglobin level 10.1 g per deciliter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were performed. Dr. Pourvaziri: Transabdominal ultrasonography with Doppler analysis revealed a heterogeneous mass\\, measuring 16.6 cm by 15.6 cm by 9.9 cm\\, that was inseparable from the right ovary with the use of probe pressure maneuvers. The mass had normal vascular flow and areas of increased echogenicity. The left ovary was normal\\, and there was a moderate-to-large amount of free fluid in the pelvis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1)\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, showed a heterogeneously attenuating mass\\, measuring 17.8 cm by 13.6 cm by 8.6 cm\\, that displaced the bowel and pelvic viscera. The mass had prominent amorphous\\, peripherally enhancing components and internal vasculature. The right ovary was not definitively identified separately. There was a large amount of ascitic fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis (Figure 1)\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, also showed a heterogeneous mass with thick\\, nodular\\, peripheral enhancement that appeared to originate from the right adnexa. The endometrial lining appeared thickened\\, measuring up to 22 mm in thickness. FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies. Dr. Connolly: The patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.,Juvenile granulosa-cell tumor."
