[{"user_input": "Dr. Alexandra T. Lucas (Pediatrics): A 19-year-old man was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital because of shock, multiple organ failure, and rash.\nThe patient had been well until 20 hours before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed after he ate rice, chicken, and lo mein leftovers from a restaurant meal. Multiple episodes of emesis occurred, with vomitus that was either bilious or red-brown. The abdominal pain and vomiting were followed by the development of chills, generalized weakness, progressively worsening diffuse myalgias, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, neck stiffness, and blurry vision. Five hours before this admission, purplish discoloration of the skin developed, and a friend took the patient to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department of the other hospital, 4.5 hours before this admission, the patient reported diffuse myalgias that he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, he appeared pale, anxious, and moderately distressed; he answered questions appropriately and was oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, the pulse 147 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/124 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The oral mucous membranes were dry. On auscultation of the heart, tachycardia was present with a regular rhythm. The radial pulses were normal. The lungs were clear, without crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, without tenderness; the patient vomited yellow-green material during the examination. The skin was warm and dry and had a mottled appearance.\nBlood specimens were obtained and sent to the laboratory for culture, a complete blood count, and tests of renal function, liver function, and coagulation, as well as measurement of levels of electrolytes, glucose, lipase, lactic acid, and troponin. A urine specimen was sent for urinalysis and culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for influenza virus nucleic acid testing. Approximately 40 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, ondansetron, ceftriaxone, and a 2-liter bolus of 0.90% normal saline were administered intravenously.\nDuring the next 30 minutes, tachypnea worsened and labored breathing, hypoxemia, and cyanosis developed. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask, resulting in an oxygen saturation of 83%; then, oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 40 liters per minute. Intravenous doses of dexamethasone and vancomycin were given.\nDuring the following 40 minutes, the systolic blood pressure fell to 70 mm Hg and the dorsalis pedis pulses were noted to be weak. Approximately 110 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, a triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed in the right femoral vein and a continuous intravenous infusion of norepinephrine was initiated. After intravenous doses of midazolam, etomidate, and fentanyl were administered, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation with pressure-regulated volume control was begun, with a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of body weight, a rate of 24 breaths per minute, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm of water, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of 100%. A continuous infusion of propofol was begun.\nHypotension persisted, and a diffuse purpuric rash developed. Approximately 2 hours after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, a dose of piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered, a 1-liter bolus of 0.45% normal saline with 150 meq of sodium bicarbonate was given, and a Foley catheter was inserted. Twenty minutes later, a continuous intravenous infusion of phenylephrine was added, followed 7 minutes later by a vasopressin infusion. The patient was transported by helicopter to the PICU of this hospital.\nOn the patient\u2019s admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained from family members. A friend who had eaten the same meal as the patient the evening before admission had vomited once shortly thereafter but had not become progressively ill. The patient had a history of anxiety and depression, as well as intermittent ear infections during childhood. He had no known drug allergies. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. He smoked two packs of cigarettes weekly, smoked marijuana daily, and drank two alcoholic beverages approximately 2 times per week. He used dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine recreationally but did not use other illicit drugs.\nThe patient lived in northern New England with his mother, brother, and three cats but had been staying with a friend for 5 days before admission, during which time he had visited a beach along the ocean and a music venue. He worked part-time at a restaurant; he had not traveled recently or had any other exposure to animals or ill persons. His father had coronary artery disease, his mother had hypothyroidism, and his brother had had viral meningitis at 6 weeks of age.\nOn examination, the patient was pharmacologically sedated. The temperature was 40.8\u00b0C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/53 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was receiving mechanical ventilation with an Fio2 of 50%. He opened his eyes occasionally. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The femoral pulses were palpable, but the peripheral pulses were not palpable and the digits were cold. There was diffuse anasarca and oozing from venipuncture sites and from the site of central venous catheter insertion. A diffuse reticular purpuric rash was present on the face, chest, abdomen, back, arms, and legs, sparing the palms and soles (Fig. 1). A Foley catheter was in place, without urine output. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed perihilar airspace and diffuse interstitial opacities and bilateral small, layering pleural effusions.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 48.8  \nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201316.0, 16.4  \nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201313,000, 7930  \n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 4591  \nBands, 0\u20131300, 761  \nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 420  \nEosinophils, 0\u2013900, 206  \nBasophils, 0\u2013300, 71  \nMyelocytes, 0, 698  \nMetamyelocytes, 0, 1182  \n\nRed-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4,000,000\u20135,200,000, 5,380,000  \nSmear description, \u2014, Toxic granulation, D\u00f6hle bodies, vacuolated neutrophils, burr cells  \n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 12,000  \nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201320, 2  \nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 69.9  \nProthrombin-time international normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 7.9  \nActivated partial-thromboplastin time (sec), 22.0\u201336.0, >150.0  \nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 152  \nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 3.4  \nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 107  \nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 25  \nAnion gap (mmol/liter), 3\u201317, 20  \nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 6.1  \nPhosphorus (mg/dl), 2.6\u20134.5, 2.7  \nMagnesium (mg/dl), 1.7\u20132.4, 1.1  \nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 15  \nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 2.31  \nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 82  \n\nProtein (g/dl):\nTotal, 6.0\u20138.3, 2.7  \nAlbumin, 3.3\u20135.0, 1.6  \nGlobulin, 1.9\u20134.1, 1.1  \n\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201332, 31  \nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201333, 14  \nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 30\u2013100, 120  \n\nBilirubin (mg/dl):\nTotal, 0.0\u20131.0, 2.5  \nDirect, 0.0\u20130.4, 2.2  \n\nLactic acid (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.0, 9.4  \nD-dimer (ng/ml), <500, >10,000  \nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), <8.0, 81.4  \nFibrinogen (mg/dl), 150\u2013400, <60  \nAntithrombin III activity (%), 80\u2013130, 28  \nProtein C activity (%), 70\u2013150, 5  \nProtein S activity (%), 70\u2013150, 25  \nLupus anticoagulant screen, Negative, Positive  \n\nVenous blood gases:\nFraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, 0.60  \npH, 7.30\u20137.40, 7.17  \nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 38\u201350, 74  \nPartial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 35\u201350, <28  \nBase excess (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u20134.7  \n\nDr. Manuella Lahoud-Rahme: A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained while the patient was receiving norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vasopressin. The left ventricle had moderate dysfunction with regional wall-motion abnormalities; septal motion was decreased, but apical motion appeared to be preserved. The right ventricle had mild-to-moderate dysfunction with underfilling. There was no pericardial effusion.\nDr. Lucas: Approximately 7 hours after admission to this hospital, a diagnostic test result was received and additional management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Meningococcal purpura fulminans."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Michael D. Kritzer: A 57-year-old woman with major depressive disorder and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was evaluated at a hospital affiliated with this hospital because she was having delusions that she was dead.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 weeks before this presentation, when myalgias, cough, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting developed. She sought evaluation at the primary care clinic of an academic medical center affiliated with this hospital (the two hospitals are part of the same health care system). Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, and the patient was instructed to quarantine at home. She lived with her father and assisted him with activities of daily living; he also received a diagnosis of Covid-19.\nDuring the following week, the patient\u2019s cough persisted, and new shortness of breath developed. Her symptoms worsened; she felt that she was unable to take care of her father. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient and her father were taken to the emergency department of the other hospital, where they were both admitted for worsening Covid-19 pneumonia. The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. Treatment with remdesivir was stopped on hospital day 4 when the blood aminotransferase levels increased to three times the upper limit of the normal range.\nDuring the hospitalization, the patient was noted to have intermittent anxiety, particularly when discharge planning for her father was discussed. She and her brother declined to have their father discharged to a rehabilitation center and instead planned for him to eventually return home to quarantine with the patient. On hospital day 6, the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation was normal while she was breathing ambient air, and the blood aminotransferase levels had improved. She was discharged home with instructions to quarantine and continue taking dexamethasone.\nOne day after discharge, the patient\u2019s brother spoke to her on the telephone. He thought that she seemed to be confused and unable to take care of herself, and he asked her to return to the emergency department of the other hospital.\nOn evaluation in the emergency department, the patient explained that she was unsure why her brother had asked her to return to the hospital, and she said that she wanted to go home. She also expressed that she felt anxious about being home alone after discharge and overwhelmed about needing to care for her father at home once he was discharged from the hospital. The myalgias, cough, and shortness of breath had abated; she had no fevers, visual or auditory hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation.\nThe patient had a history of major depressive disorder, which had been diagnosed during the second decade of life. At the time of diagnosis, she had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and had received electroconvulsive therapy; thereafter, she had been discharged to a partial hospital program. She had been hospitalized for psychiatric symptoms twice since then, once for major depressive disorder and once for a mixed bipolar episode that was due to insomnia and anxious distress. The latter episode was associated with catatonic features and was treated with electroconvulsive therapy.\nThe patient had no history of suicidal or homicidal ideation or attempts and no history of violence. She had hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included dexamethasone, bupropion, fluoxetine, olanzapine, losartan, metformin, and pantoprazole. Sulfa drugs had caused angioedema, and lisinopril had caused cough. The patient was born in the Caribbean and had emigrated four decades earlier, first to southwestern Europe and then to the United States 2 years later. She lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with her father, who had mild dementia. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit substances.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 153/95 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented but guarded, with a flat affect. She appeared to be more anxious than she had been during the previous hospitalization. She paced around the room and perseverated about the care of her father. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 11,490 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000), with neutrophil predominance; the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Urinalysis and a radiograph of the chest were normal. Treatment with dexamethasone was stopped, and the patient was admitted to the hospital to facilitate discharge to a rehabilitation center for continued care.\nOn hospital day 3, the patient was noted to be more withdrawn, and she began responding to questions with one-word answers or silence. When she was encouraged to speak more, she continued to perseverate about the care of her father. When she was asked to elaborate on her concerns, she stated, \u201cHe is dead. I am dead.\u201d\nThe patient appeared disheveled, sullen, and anxious. She laid in bed motionless with her eyes open and looking forward, and she responded briefly to questions in a quiet voice with slowed speech. Her thoughts were perseverative and tangential. There was no evidence that she had loosening of associations, hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. She had poor insight and judgment. Memory, attention, concentration, abstract reasoning, and fund of knowledge were normal. When her arms and legs were lifted against gravity and released, they fell to the bed without resistance; with encouragement, she was able to move them. Muscle tone was normal, with no rigidity or waxy flexibility. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Aaron B. Paul: Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of an acute territorial infarct, intracranial mass, or hemorrhage. There was nonspecific moderate confluent hypoattenuation involving the supratentorial white matter.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Head.\nDr. Kritzer: Clonazepam was administered, and the dose of olanzapine was increased. Admission to an inpatient psychiatric unit was recommended. During the next week, while awaiting placement in an inpatient psychiatric unit, the patient continued to show signs of anxiety and a depressed mood. She said, \u201cI am dead. I do not exist. I am not real.\u201d She also believed that her father and brother, as well as her nurses and doctors, were dead. The patient was selectively mute and motionless, but she talked and moved with encouragement. She expressed that she felt directly responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic and asked to be thrown out of the window. She had the sensation that her bladder was gone and that she could not urinate, although she had been observed urinating independently. She felt that she could not eat, although she had been observed eating breakfast daily. On hospital day 9, the patient was transferred to the inpatient psychiatric unit of the other hospital.\nA diagnosis and management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Cotard\u2019s syndrome, catatonia, depression, and seizure after coronavirus disease 2019."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Kathleen W. Miller (Medicine): A 64-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in early winter with fever and pancytopenia.\nThe patient, who had multiple sclerosis, had been in her usual state of health until 7 months before admission, when nausea and fatigue developed. Over the next 2 months, these symptoms worsened, and in the context of severe nausea, two episodes of vasovagal syncope occurred. During an evaluation for syncope, anemia was noted. Five months before admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care provider at another hospital. The weight was 87.6 kg, and the results of physical examination were normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, cobalamin, folate, iron, iron saturation, and total iron-binding capacity were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed cholelithiasis and splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 17 cm in the craniocaudal dimension (normal value, \u226412 cm).\nTwo and a half months before admission, the patient was evaluated in a hematology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She reported persistent nausea and fatigue, poor appetite with reduced oral intake, and 2 weeks of dyspnea on exertion. There was no orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The weight was 83.2 kg, and the spleen tip was palpable four fingerbreadths below the costal margin; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, and examination of the bone marrow specimen revealed mildly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and mild dyserythropoiesis.\nTreatment with prednisone and folic acid was begun. Ocrelizumab infusions for multiple sclerosis were stopped. Nausea and fatigue persisted, and fevers and sweats developed. After 3 weeks of treatment with prednisone, the anemia had not abated and the patient had temperatures as high as 39.0\u00b0C. Testing for influenza A and B viruses was negative. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The course of prednisone was tapered off over the next 18 days, and the patient was referred to a hematologist affiliated with this hospital.\nIn the hematology clinic, the patient reported that the fevers had resolved but the fatigue, weakness, and poor appetite had worsened. She felt too fatigued to walk, and she had recently had a fall without loss of consciousness. The weight was 82.4 kg; splenomegaly was present, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nIn addition to relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis, there was a history of trigeminal neuralgia, restless legs syndrome, vasovagal syncope when blood samples were obtained, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level for 1 year without a clear cause. Medications included oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, ropinirole, folic acid, and cholecalciferol. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had quit smoking 20 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her adult son and pet cat and dog. Her backyard adjoined a large wooded area where deer were often seen. She worked in health care administration. Her family history included diabetes in her mother, lung cancer in her father, and multiple sclerosis in her sister.\nOn examination, the patient appeared pale but not unwell.

Docusate, senna, and topical lidocaine jelly were prescribed.\nThree days before this admission, bowel movements with tarry black and loose maroon stools and dark clots began to occur multiple times a day. When the episodes increased in frequency to every hour and there was bright-red blood per rectum, the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported severe rectal pain and burning, as well as fatigue, dizziness, and weakness. She did not report fever, chills, abdominal pain, hematemesis, hemoptysis, epistaxis, rash, bruising, hematuria, or menorrhagia.\nThe patient was congenitally deaf. She had received a diagnosis of kidney disease 12 years earlier, when proteinuria and hypertension developed during pregnancy and did not resolve postpartum. Pathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen had reportedly revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The patient was presumed to have Alport\u2019s syndrome; no genetic testing had been performed.\nTen years before the current evaluation, the patient had discontinued all prescribed medications, including prednisone and labetalol, without talking to her doctors; 3 years later, she presented to this hospital with dyspnea on exertion and end-stage renal failure. Hemodialysis was started and continued until a deceased-donor renal transplantation was performed 6 months before the current evaluation.\nRoutine pretransplantation serologic testing of the patient revealed IgG antibodies to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and no antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV). Serologic testing of the donor also revealed IgG antibodies to EBV and no antibodies to CMV. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin, belatacept, prednisone, and everolimus was initiated; famciclovir was administered for 3 months after transplantation.

The dose of everolimus had been decreased 1 month before this evaluation; belatacept had last been infused 2 weeks earlier. There were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived with her male partner and young son in an urban area of New England. She had not traveled recently. She had previously worked part-time as a teacher. There had been no exposure to animals other than two pet dogs. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol. Her sister was deaf and had a history of renal failure that had led to renal transplantation. Her father had a history of diabetes and renal failure that required hemodialysis.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 85/46 mm Hg, the pulse 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared pale and unwell. There was no jaundice or lymphadenopathy. There were palatal petechiae and sublingual ecchymoses, but there was no bleeding from the gums or nose. There was a healed surgical incision in the right lower abdomen and no tenderness over the renal allograft. A rectal examination revealed tenderness and dark blood with clots.\nThe hemoglobin level was 6.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 0 per microliter. A peripheral-blood smear showed red cells that were generally normal in size and morphology, with few hypochromic cells and rare pencil cells; there were no schistocytes or platelets. A direct antiglobulin test was negative. Blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Onofrio A. Catalano: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no bowel-wall thickening or distention. The spleen and liver were normal in size. The renal allograft was visible in the right lower quadrant (Figure 1). The transplanted kidney was enlarged and surrounded by extensive perinephric fat stranding. A small amount of free fluid was also present. There was moderate hydroureteronephrosis that extended up to the ureterovesical anastomosis. The renal collecting system, pelvis, and ureter contained spontaneously hyperdense material that was suggestive of blood breakdown products. No obstructing calculi were seen.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Renal Allograft.\nDr. Roberts: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the blood pressure increased to 97/53 mm Hg. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with everolimus and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was stopped.

There was intermittent swelling of the eyelids but no photophobia, itching, pain, tearing, or discharge. The patient\u2019s parents administered naphazoline hydrochloride and glycerin eye drops, but the eye redness did not abate. When the eye redness had persisted for 2 weeks, the patient was taken to the pediatrics clinic of another hospital. She was given a 7-day course of an oral antibiotic agent as empirical treatment for possible preseptal cellulitis.\nFive weeks before the current evaluation, the eye redness persisted despite treatment, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital. The blood pressure was not measured during this evaluation. The visual acuity with correction was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination revealed abundant white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were also keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and rare iris nodules in the right eye. Funduscopic examination was notable for optic-disk swelling and peripheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes, as well as perivascular exudates in the right eye. Cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes were prescribed.\nDuring the subsequent 3 weeks, additional tests were performed in the pediatrics clinic of the other hospital. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, syphilis, and Lyme disease were negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was indeterminate. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Funduscopic examination (Figure 2) showed vitreous white cells, optic-disk swelling, perivascular exudates, peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nFIGURE 2\n\nFundus Photographs.\nDuring the next 4 days, additional tests were performed, and sputum specimens were obtained for an acid-fast bacilli smear and culture. Optical coherence tomography revealed optic-disk swelling but no cystoid macular swelling. Fluorescein angiography revealed optic-disk leakage with areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion and some vessel leakage.\nDr. Figueiro Longo: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1C), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed protrusion and enhancement of the optic disks and enhancement of the irises, a finding consistent with the clinical diagnosis of uveitis. There was no evidence of optic neuritis or perineuritis.\nDr. Diacovo: The administration of cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes was continued. Treatment with oral prednisone was started, and a regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was begun as empirical treatment for possible tuberculosis. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. She was instructed to follow up in the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital and was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the rheumatology clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient had had normal growth and development and was currently in middle school. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had emigrated from West Africa to the United States 6 years earlier; since then, she had lived with her mother and father in a suburban town in New England and had not traveled outside the region. Six months before this evaluation, an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for M. tuberculosis had been positive. At that time, the patient had received a prescription for a medication to treat latent tuberculosis infection; however, the patient\u2019s parents could not recall giving the medication to the patient. She was taking the prescribed cyclopentolate and prednisolone eye drops, oral prednisone, and regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient\u2019s parents were healthy.\nA diagnosis and management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Sarcoidosis"}, {"user_input": "Dr. James W. Luccarelli (Psychiatry): A 70-year-old man with bipolar disorder was evaluated at this hospital because of depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and gait disturbance.\nThe patient had a long history of depressive episodes, with two previous hospitalizations for suicide attempts. Approximately two decades before the current admission, he was struck on the head with a beam while working at a construction site and had a 4-cm laceration. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital, where the wound was sutured but no further evaluation was conducted.\nApproximately 10 years before the current admission, around the time of his mother\u2019s death, the patient was evaluated at this hospital because of an episode of irritability, a reduced need for sleep, and grandiosity; he reported feelings of \u201ctranscendence\u201d and being \u201cat one with God.\u201d He was admitted for 1 month to the psychiatry unit of a second hospital, where he was treated with lithium and electroconvulsive therapy. Thereafter, he received outpatient psychiatric treatment on a monthly basis, as well as therapy with valproic acid and fluoxetine.\nApproximately 9 years before the current admission, the patient fell on concrete stairs and had back pain with subsequent lower-leg weakness and urinary incontinence. He was evaluated at a third hospital, where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes, including L4\u2013L5 spinal stenosis and central disk protrusion. Acetaminophen and physical therapy were prescribed.\nFive years later (4 years before the current admission), the patient fell because of an unsteady gait and was evaluated at a fourth hospital. Neurologic examination revealed a memory deficit (with an inability to recall any objects after 5 minutes on the three-item object-recall test) and poor attention (with an inability to perform serial sevens calculations), as well as action tremor in the arms and \u201cmildly unsteady\u201d gait, even with the use of a cane. The remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, results of renal function tests, and levels of electrolytes, valproic acid, folate, vitamin B12, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin were normal; serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. MRI of the head reportedly revealed no evidence of an infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or a mass but showed mild prominence of ventricles, sulci, and cisterns. The dose of fluoxetine was decreased, and the patient was discharged 3 days later.\nAdditional falls occurred 2 months and 4 months later, and both times, the patient was evaluated at the fourth hospital. Two months after the most recent fall, he hit the car in front of him while driving. His psychiatrist noted that he had bilateral tremor at rest; the dose of valproic acid was reduced, and he was referred to a neurologist. Two months after the car crash, he fell while walking and was evaluated at the fourth hospital. The evaluation was notable for nystagmus and a normal valproic acid level (89 \u03bcg per milliliter; reference range, 50 to 100) despite the dose reduction; the doses of valproic acid and trazodone were reduced, and physical therapy was provided. During the next 5 months, gait instability was reduced but persisted. The patient was evaluated by two other neurologists after reporting a feeling of \u201cimbalance.\u201d Audiometry revealed mild-to-moderate high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Medications were considered to be a contributor to his balance dysfunction.\nDuring the next 12 months, the dose of valproic acid was tapered and fluoxetine was stopped; the patient underwent trials of escitalopram and then sertraline for the treatment of depressive symptoms. He reported to his psychiatrist symptoms of confusion, some difficulty with memory, and decreased leg coordination. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 23 (scores range from 0 to 30, with a score of 18 to 25 suggesting mild cognitive impairment).\nDr. McKinley Glover: Fifteen months before the current admission, the patient began to have dizziness. MRI of the head (Figure 1), performed at this hospital, revealed an old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss, and mild ventricular prominence.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial MRI of the Head.\nDr. Luccarelli: Neuropsychiatric testing was performed, and the results did not suggest a neurodegenerative process. Given the patient\u2019s progressively depressed mood, treatment with aripiprazole was started, with the dose adjusted over the following 12 months.\nThree months before the current admission, the patient reported worsening depression, with hopelessness, guilt, and increased sleep. That month, his son found him unable to walk and requiring assistance to move. On examination, he had tremor and muscle rigidity; on ambulation, he had a shuffling gait and required a cane. Treatment with aripiprazole was stopped, benztropine was started, and sertraline was replaced by fluoxetine.\nOne month before the current admission, the patient was voluntarily hospitalized in the psychiatry unit of this hospital because of worsening depression, which he attributed to the progressive reduction in mobility and strength. He reported 3 weeks of frequent early morning awakenings, anhedonia, low energy, anorexia, difficulty concentrating, and low motivation, such that he had not paid bills or bathed. Examination was notable for tremor, muscle rigidity, and a shuffling gait. Blood levels of folate, vitamin B12, and glycated hemoglobin were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 antibodies and type 1 antigen and for antitreponemal antibodies were negative. Over the 5-day hospitalization, the dose of fluoxetine was increased and treatment with lurasidone was started.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), 1 Mo before Admission (This Hospital), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 130, 136  \nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 4.6, 4.4  \nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 92, 99  \nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 25, 24  \nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 21, 18  \nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.99, 1.02  \nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 77, 74  \nValproic acid (\u03bcg/ml), 50\u2013100, 66.8, 50.8  \n25-Hydroxyvitamin D (ng/ml), 20\u201380, 27, 29  \nThyrotropin (\u03bcIU/ml), 0.40\u20135.00, 6.66, 3.21  \nFree thyroxine (ng/dl), 0.9\u20131.8, 1.2, \u2014\n\nDuring the following 4 weeks, the patient\u2019s ability to walk continued to deteriorate, and he required intermittent use of a walker and a wheelchair. His depressive symptoms persisted, and after he reported thoughts of suicide and feeling unsafe to his psychiatrist, he was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for malaise, anorexia, poor sleep, anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt, low energy, worsening gait, and chronic joint pain; he reported no recent falls or manic symptoms.\nThe patient\u2019s psychiatric history included bipolar depression with suicide attempts and multiple psychiatric admissions, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, and skin picking. His medical history was notable for long-standing urinary incontinence, hypertension, and sleep apnea; he had undergone laser ablation of the prostate 4 years earlier, as well as bilateral inguinal hernia repair and rotator cuff repair. Medications at the time of admission included fluoxetine, lurasidone, valproic acid, aspirin, and lisinopril, as well as lorazepam and trazodone as needed. Lithium had caused tremor, aripiprazole had caused muscle rigidity and tremor, and gabapentin had caused grogginess. The patient did not smoke tobacco, and he drank alcohol less than once monthly; he had previously smoked marijuana several times daily but had been abstinent for 2 years. He was retired from employment as a laborer. He was divorced and resided in an assisted-living facility. His family history was notable for major depression in his mother and bipolar disorder in one of his children.\nThe temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/61 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.5. The patient was wheelchair-bound. He was described as well-groomed and cooperative, with appropriate eye contact. He was oriented to time, place, and person. His speech was fluent and indicated a logical thought process but was considered to be \u201cslow.\u201d Some of his responses seemed slow, but naming, repetition, attention, concentration, and memory were intact. His mood and affect were described as depressed, and he had suicidal ideation. Results of cranial nerve examination were normal, except for reduced facial expression. Motor examination showed mildly increased tone in the lower legs and left arm, with bradykinesia, and was otherwise normal. The gait was described as being \u201cslow to start\u201d with a \u201cmagnetic quality\u201d and then as \u201cshuffling\u201d for a few steps. The remainder of the neurologic and general physical examinations was normal.\nThe white-cell count, platelet count, and levels of hemoglobin, calcium, and albumin were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Glover: MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed the old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, and mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss with prominence of the ventricles and sylvian fissures. There was no abnormal enhancement. Coronal reformatted images showed a callosal angle (the angle at which the two lateral ventricles meet at the level of the posterior commissure) of 66 degrees.\nFIGURE 2\n\nAdditional MRI of the Head.\nDr. Luccarelli: Diagnostic tests were performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Normal pressure hydrocephalus."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Alison C. Castle: A 70-year-old woman with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was evaluated in a clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, because of cough, shortness of breath, and malaise.\nFifteen years before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of HIV infection after she had presented with substantial weight loss and fatigue. The initial CD4 cell count obtained at the time of diagnosis was 29 cells per microliter (reference range, 332 to 1642). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) with stavudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz was started. During the subsequent year, the symptoms resolved, the HIV RNA level became undetectable, and the patient reported adherence to her medications. Ten years before the current presentation, additional ART became accessible within South Africa, and the ART regimen was changed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz.\nFive years before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to a local hospital because of diarrhea and diffuse myalgias, and she was found to have virologic failure. The ART regimen was changed to zidovudine, lamivudine, and lopinavir\u2013ritonavir. During the subsequent 4 years, the patient reported adherence to these medications without a lapse in treatment. The HIV RNA level ranged from 68 to 594,000 copies per milliliter of plasma (reference value, undetectable).\nTwelve months before the current presentation, the patient had new shortness of breath, cough, anorexia, and weight loss. During the subsequent 4 weeks, the symptoms progressively increased in severity. When the shortness of breath worsened to the extent that she was unable to walk, she sought evaluation at the clinic. The temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 104/64 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 16.9. On examination, the patient appeared ill but was able to speak in full sentences. Auscultation of the chest was limited because of frequent coughing; diffuse crackles were present in both lungs.\nNucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear of the sputum was positive for mycobacteria, and subsequent nucleic acid testing and culture of the sputum was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. In accordance with recommendations from the South African Department of Health, the patient was instructed to isolate at home and complete a course of treatment for tuberculosis, which included rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable,Reference Range,11 Mo before Current Presentation,4 Mo before Current Presentation,On Current Presentation\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201315.0, 9.6, \u2014, 7.6\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 29.3, \u2014, 24.5\nMean corpuscular volume (fl), 78.9\u201398.5, 97.7, \u2014, 99.6\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 186,000\u2013454,000, 146,000, \u2014, 104,000\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 3900\u201312,600, 1900, \u2014, 1960\n\nCD4 cell count:\nRelative count (%), 28.00\u201351.00, 0.87, \u2014, 2.31\nAbsolute count (per \u00b5l), 332\u20131642, 6, \u2014, 6\n\nHIV RNA (copies/ml of plasma), 0\u201320, \u2014, 151,000, 793\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), 0\u201310, 38, \u2014, 14\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201310, 122, \u2014, \u2014\nCryptococcal antigen, serum lateral flow assay, Negative, Negative, \u2014, \u2014\n\nDuring the subsequent 6 months, the patient took the antimycobacterial medications, and the shortness of breath and cough decreased but still persisted. Her weight decreased by 8 kg, even though the anorexia had resolved. Four months before the current presentation, new headaches and mouth ulcers developed, and the patient sought evaluation at the clinic. A sputum specimen was obtained for examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear and mycobacterial nucleic acid testing and culture, all of which were negative. The HIV RNA level was 151,000 copies per milliliter of plasma. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment.\nTwelve days before the current presentation, the patient presented to the clinic for follow-up, and the ART regimen was changed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. When the symptoms did not abate, the patient presented to the clinic for additional evaluation. She described persistent shortness of breath and dry cough, as well as headaches on the right side and mouth ulcers. The review of systems was notable for fatigue and weakness during the past 12 months, as well as fever, night sweats, chest pain, mouth ulcers, and odynophagia. She had no ageusia, anosmia, vision changes, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, or joint pain. Radiography of the chest had not been performed.\nThe patient had not received vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). She took tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolutegravir, as well as acetaminophen for muscle pain as needed. There were no known drug allergies. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs; she did not take any remedies from traditional healers. The patient lived with her daughter in a rural farming community in a coastal region of South Africa, and she had not traveled recently. She commuted by foot within her community and had regular exposure to cattle, goats, chickens, and dogs. Her household water supply originated from a borehole and was untreated.\nOn examination, the patient was alert but appeared ill and cachectic. She coughed throughout the interview. The blood pressure was 97/71 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. The body-mass index was 13.7. The mucous membranes were dry. She had thrush on the tongue, as well as superficial ulcers on the buccal mucosa. On auscultation of the chest, diffuse crackles were present in both lungs and were worst in the right lower lobe. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal.

Over the next 2 days, chills, vomiting, neck pain, and headache with sonophobia developed. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital, where an evaluation reportedly showed dry mucous membranes but no signs of meningitis. The white-cell count was 12,300 per microliter (reference range, 4800 to 10,800), and the platelet count was 95,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Intravenous normal saline and morphine were administered, and the patient was discharged with supportive care for a presumed viral syndrome.\nDuring the next week, the patient had worsening headache and new photophobia, as well as malaise, anorexia, nonproductive cough, and dyspnea with minimal exertion. Two days before the current presentation, the patient\u2019s mother noticed episodes of confusion with nonsensical speech and excessive sleepiness, and she took the patient back to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported ongoing severe headaches and dyspnea.

The patient had photophobia, but the neurologic examination was reportedly otherwise normal. She had mild throat erythema and diffuse abdominal tenderness with intermittent guarding. A urine test for beta human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained.\nTable 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed subarachnoid hemorrhage and diffuse ischemic changes in the parietal and temporal lobes. Lumbar puncture was deferred because of thrombocytopenia. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed diffuse interstitial lung markings, multiple opacities and nodules in the peripheral lung, two hypodensities in the peripheral spleen, and subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and doxycycline was administered. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital.\nThe next morning, screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus were negative, as was a blood-smear examination for parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Platelets were transfused, and intravenous normal saline was administered. The respiratory rate increased to 45 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 93% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 8 liters per minute; ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure was attempted, and intravenous furosemide was administered. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole were discontinued, and empirical treatment with intravenous meropenem and clindamycin was administered. The patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital.\nOn arrival at this hospital, the patient had confusion and tachypnea and thus provided a limited history, but family members provided additional information. The patient had a history of depression, for which she received citalopram. She had no known drug allergies. She worked in health care. She drank wine socially, used electronic cigarettes, and occasionally smoked marijuana but did not smoke tobacco. Her most recent travel had been to the Caribbean more than 1 year before the current presentation. She had no exposure to wooded or rural areas. Her family had dogs, but she had no bites or scratches; she had no other animal or insect exposures. There were no recent sexual contacts. Her mother had cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and her maternal grandmother had Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 103/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 49 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 8 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22. The patient appeared to be in respiratory distress, with accessory muscles used for breathing. She was oriented only after prompting. She had meningismus and concomitant rigidity of the shoulders with passive range of motion, but she had no focal cranial-nerve, strength, or sensory deficits. Auscultation of the lungs and heart revealed diffuse rales and rhonchi, as well as a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur that was loudest at the apex and left axilla and radiated to the sternum. The spleen tip was palpable. A small patch of petechiae was present on the upper chest. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of phosphorus, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; antinuclear antibodies were undetectable. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional blood cultures were obtained. Chest radiography showed diffuse lung opacities and pleural effusions on both sides. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia with normal intervals and nonspecific minor ST- and T-wave changes. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, doxycycline, and acyclovir was administered.\nFour hours after admission, increased work of breathing, tachypnea, and confusion progressed, and the trachea was intubated for initiation of mechanical ventilation. Intravenous propofol, hydromorphone, and phenylephrine were administered. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, revealing mildly bloody and frothy effluent from all the lobes of the lungs. On examination of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, the nucleated-cell count was 375 per microliter, with 77% neutrophils. Gram\u2019s staining showed no organisms. Tests for common respiratory virus \u2014 including influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses \u2014 were negative. A culture was also obtained.\nDr. Eric W. Zhang: CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral scattered curvilinear hyperdensities in the cortical sulci, findings suggestive of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (Figure 1A). There were also focal hypodense regions in the left superior parietal lobule and right temporal lobe with loss of normal gray\u2013white matter differentiation, findings suggestive of acute cortical infarcts (Figure 1B). CT pulmonary angiography showed evidence of mild interstitial edema, bilateral pleural effusions, and multifocal peribronchovascular nodular opacities and consolidations involving all the lobes of the lungs, some of which were peripherally distributed, without cavitation (Figure 1C). CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed several splenic hypodensities, which were most likely splenic infarcts, with accompanying mild ascites and mild periportal edema (Figure 1D).\nFigure 1\n\nCT and MRI Images.\nDr. McFadden: Platelets were transfused, and lumbar puncture was performed, with an opening pressure of 38 cm of water.

Her medical history included measles encephalitis, which had been diagnosed when she was 6 years of age and had resulted in weakness on the left side, severe vision and hearing impairment, and gait and balance disturbance. After rehabilitation therapy, her balance and gait apparently normalized, but she had mild residual weakness on the left side, which resulted in a change from left-hand to right-hand dominance.\nTwo years before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She reported difficulties with balance, which worsened with head turning. She reported no disequilibrium, vertigo, back pain, paresthesia, or numbness. On examination, her cognitive function was intact, and although her speech was dysarthric and hypophonic, these abnormalities could have been associated with her hearing loss. The cranial-nerve examination revealed abnormal eye movements, with square-wave jerks, saccadic pursuit, and bilateral horizontal nystagmus. The hearing and vision were severely reduced. The muscle bulk was decreased throughout, and tone was normal. Motor strength was full and symmetric in the arms and legs bilaterally, and contractures were present in the fingers of the left hand. Reflexes were reduced or absent throughout, and plantar reflexes were extensor bilaterally. Vibratory sensation was reduced at the great toes but was otherwise normal. The patient had appendicular dysmetria on both finger-to-nose testing and heel-to-shin testing that was greater on the left side than on the right side. Her gait was wide-based, and she was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg sign was present.\nNeedle electromyographic findings and the results of nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine revealed mild multilevel degenerative disk disease without clinically significant spinal-canal stenosis. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 0 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and oligoclonal bands were absent. Tests of the CSF and serum for antibodies associated with autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis were negative (Table 1).

The patient initially attributed the weakness to fatigue, since it had occurred during a time of increased physical activity associated with moving to a different apartment. However, the weakness did not abate, and 2 months before this admission, she was again evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She noted difficulty with communicating in sign language and with holding objects in her right hand because of weakness and had started using her left hand to eat. She reported no neck, arm, or leg pain and no sensory loss. Her gait and balance were stable, with no recent falls.\nOn examination, there was reduced facial expression and reduced muscle bulk and tone throughout. The right shoulder was dropped, with weakness in the right trapezius and reduced active shoulder abduction that was limited to 70 degrees, without pain on shoulder abduction. There was predominantly proximal weakness in the right arm; the muscle strength was 4\u2212/5 on shoulder abduction and external rotation, 4+/5 on elbow flexion, and 4/5 on elbow extension, wrist extension, and abductor digiti minimi and finger extension. The strength in the right leg was normal. There was subtle weakness on the left side that involved wrist and finger extension and great toe extension. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right biceps and 1+ at the left biceps and were otherwise areflexic throughout. Sensation was intact in the arms, but there was decreased vibratory sensation and proprioception at the great toes; sensation was otherwise normal. Moderate appendicular dysmetria was present in the arms and legs. The patient\u2019s gait, which was assessed while she was using her white cane (the type of cane commonly used by blind or visually impaired persons), was wide-based; she took excessively large steps and reached out once to touch the wall. Neurologic examination was otherwise unchanged from the examination performed 2 years earlier. Additional studies were obtained.\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was reported to be normal. MRI of the cervical spine was also performed without the administration of contrast material; T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed signal hyperintensity in the suboccipital and paraspinal soft tissues that was consistent with edema. Areas of intrinsic hyperintense signal that were consistent with fatty atrophy were seen on T1-weighted imaging. There were diffuse degenerative changes with mild spinal-canal stenosis at C4\u2013C5, without cord compression.\nDr. Avetisyan: Repeat needle electromyography revealed no recorded motor units in the right deltoid or infraspinatus muscles, with complex repetitive discharges in the right cervical paraspinal and deltoid muscles. Nerve-conduction studies revealed mild reduction in the amplitudes of the bilateral median and right ulnar sensory responses; the sensory responses of the right radial, bilateral antebrachial cutaneous, and bilateral medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves were normal, as were the motor responses of the right median and right ulnar nerves.\nDuring the ensuing 2 months, the weakness in the right arm progressed rapidly, which caused the patient to have difficulty ambulating with her white cane (she was unable to walk with a standard cane), making walking unsafe after frequent falls and rendering her practically bedbound. She had no pain or numbness in her arm. She was ultimately unable to care for herself at home and was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation.\nOther medical history included hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism. Medications included ascorbic acid, vitamin B complex, coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, calcium carbonate and cholecalciferol, and levothyroxine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone and worked for a nonprofit agency. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank four glasses of wine per week, and did not use illicit drugs. She reported that her father had died from Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease when he was 71 years of age, 7 months after the onset of symptoms. Her mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which was diagnosed when she was in her 60s; she was currently living in a nursing home. The patient had four siblings; one had died at 46 years of age from an intracerebral hemorrhage, and her remaining three siblings were well.\nOn examination, the temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/64 mm Hg, the pulse 61 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 15.8. The patient appeared emaciated but was able to sit up in a chair and hold her head up. Strength in her right arm had decreased to 2/5 on shoulder shrug, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, and elbow extension, with 3/5 strength on wrist extension and finger flexion and extension. There was new proximal weakness in the right leg, with 4/5 strength on right hip flexion. The strength in the left arm was unchanged. Deep-tendon reflexes were 3+ at the right biceps and 2+ at the brachioradialis and were otherwise absent throughout. She had ataxia as well as occasional jerks that involved the legs (with the left leg affected to a greater extent than the right leg) and were possibly stimulus-induced. The remainder of the neurologic examination was unchanged from the last visit.\nDr. Schaefer: MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a new linear signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging but also a marked decrease in subtle restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging and hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging (identified in retrospect on the previous MRI) in the left frontal and left parietal lobes (Figure 1). MRI of the whole spine, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was unchanged from previous imaging.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Avetisyan: The creatine kinase level was normal.

Peyton (Medicine): A 43-year-old man was evaluated in the multidisciplinary Pulmonary Nodule Clinic of this hospital because of an incidentally found pulmonary nodule.\nOne month before the current evaluation, the patient, who lived in Panama, was seen at a primary care clinic in Colombia for a routine annual physical examination. He was in his usual state of good health, but because of a family history of cancer, he requested that imaging studies be obtained.\nDr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography (CT) of the neck, chest, and abdomen (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a pulmonary nodule (measuring 12 mm by 13 mm) in the right middle lobe.\nFIGURE 1\n\nChest CT.\nDr. Peyton: During the next month, follow-up testing was performed. The 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid level in a 24-hour urine specimen and the chromogranin A level in blood were reportedly normal, as were the results of pulmonary function testing and colonoscopy.\nDr. Shepard: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT (Figure 2) revealed FDG uptake in the right-middle-lobe nodule (measuring 14 mm in diameter), with a maximum standardized uptake value of 3.8. There was also FDG uptake in multiple normal-sized right inferior paratracheal, subcarinal, and hilar lymph nodes. A right hilar lymph node (measuring 8 mm in diameter) had a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.7.\nFIGURE 2\n\nPET Scan.\nDr. Peyton: The patient requested evaluation in the United States and was referred to the multidisciplinary Pulmonary Nodule Clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient felt well. He had no fever, shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, headache, vision changes, oral ulcers, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, arthralgias, or rash. He reported no recent illnesses.\nThe patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Three years before this evaluation, chest radiography and abdominal ultrasonography, performed at his request because of a family history of cancer, had reportedly shown no abnormalities. The patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He worked in the finance industry and had previously been a health care worker. He was born in northern South America and had moved to southern Central America 5 years earlier. He lived in an urban area with his wife, son, and dog.\nThe patient had visited nearly every country in North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. Four years earlier, he had traveled by motorcycle from Alaska to Panama; 6 months earlier, he had traveled by motorcycle from Colombia to Chile. The patient had also traveled to several countries in western and eastern Europe, northern Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific Islands. He had a physically active lifestyle that included weight lifting and bicycling at least four times per week. He had smoked two cigarettes daily and one cigar every 3 months for 2 years. His family history of cancer included breast cancer in his mother, prostate and pancreatic cancers in his father, cancer of unknown primary origin in his maternal grandfather, and ovarian cancer in his paternal grandmother.\nOn evaluation, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 133/82 mm Hg, the pulse 68 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.1. He appeared well, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. There was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The white-cell count was 6970 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the hemoglobin level 12.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the platelet count 213,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000).

Nestor (Medicine): A 41-year-old woman with transient dysarthria and facial droop was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of masses on the mitral valve.\nThree weeks before this presentation, the patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital because of concerns about heavy vaginal bleeding that had developed 1 week earlier and was associated with crampy abdominal pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and lightheadedness. Examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/79 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 100% while she was breathing ambient air; the examination was otherwise reportedly normal, although a gynecologic examination was not performed. Laboratory results were notable for a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0; previous level 1 year earlier, 9.1), a mean corpuscular volume of 71.3 fl (reference range, 80 to 94), and a platelet count of 148,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Normal saline was administered intravenously, and a 5-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed.\nEleven days after the patient completed the therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate (9 days before this presentation), heavy vaginal bleeding and dyspnea recurred. An additional 3-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed. The evening after the patient finished the second course of treatment, within 1 hour after she had been seen and had appeared to be well, her husband noted that she had facial droop on the right side and slurred speech; he called emergency medical services. When she arrived at the emergency department of a second hospital, within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms, her examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 173/83 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 99% while she was breathing ambient air. She was noted to have facial droop on the right side and unintelligible speech.\nDr. Sandra P. Rincon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Figure 1A) revealed no evidence of acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage. Small chronic infarcts were seen in the right thalamus and right cerebellar hemisphere. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck did not show high-grade stenosis or large-vessel occlusion.\nFIGURE 1\n\nNeuroimaging Studies.\nDr. Nestor: A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. Blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the white-cell count and differential count and the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable, and urinalysis showed 3+ blood, no protein, and no casts. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Post-transfusion laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 2A and 2B and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) showed thickened mitral valve leaflets and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg.\nFIGURE 2\n\nEchocardiograms and CT Scans of the Abdomen and Pelvis.\nDr. Evin Yucel: On the third hospital day, a transesophageal echocardiogram (Figure 2C and Videos 2 and 3) showed multiple echodensities on the atrial side of the mitral valve leaflets at the closure lines that were consistent with vegetations. Cultures of blood were obtained, and heparin was administered intravenously.\nDr. Nestor: On the fourth hospital day, the rate of heparin infusion was decreased at 6-hour intervals when the partial-thromboplastin time exceeded 150 seconds, until the infusion was stopped. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1; complement levels (C3 and C4) were normal. Additional cultures of blood were obtained.\nDr. Rincon: Repeat CT of the head revealed no acute abnormality. CT of the chest showed clustered nodules in the lower lobes that were probably related to aspiration, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2D, 2E, and 2F) revealed an enlarged heterogeneous uterus with multiple fibroids.\nDr. Nestor: The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On a review of systems, she reported no recurrence of dysarthria or facial droop and noted no other neurologic symptoms. She reported that she had had heavy menstrual bleeding and exertional dyspnea in the weeks preceding this presentation; pruritic, macular rashes on the trunk, scalp, arms, and legs with associated photosensitivity that had persisted for many weeks; new Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon in the past 10 months; and a long history of dry eyes and seasonal allergies. Medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, vitamin B12 deficiency, iron deficiency resulting in past iron infusions, uterine fibroids, anxiety, and hypertension. Surgical history included multiple laparoscopies and two laparotomies, including salpingo-oophorectomy for endometriosis. Owing to infertility, she had undergone in vitro fertilization; she had a first-trimester spontaneous abortion at 25 years of age. During her second pregnancy at 33 years of age, a screening rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was positive at 1:8; however, a treponemal-specific confirmatory test for syphilis was negative. Pregnancy-induced hypertension developed, followed by placental abruption at 30 weeks, which resulted in a cesarean delivery. Medications included amlodipine, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, and medroxyprogesterone acetate. She had no known medication allergies.\nThe patient lived in eastern Massachusetts with her husband and child. She did not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. Her mother had rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and a history of spontaneous abortion. One grandmother had diabetes and the other grandmother had had a stroke. An aunt had had leukemia and later breast cancer. Her child has psoriasis.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 155/98 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 175 cm, the weight 107 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 34.9. There were several small, circular macules on her back (Figure 3). There was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex. She had no lymphadenopathy, petechiae, nail changes, or evidence of arthritis. The remainder of the examination was normal, as was a neurologic examination.\nFIGURE 3\n\nClinical Photograph of Macules on the Back.\nLaboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Chen: A 34-year-old woman was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital for the management of relapsed, metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\nThe patient had been well until 3 years before this evaluation, when acute abdominal and back pain developed, and she presented to the emergency department of another hospital. As part of the evaluation, abdominal ultrasonography was performed and reportedly revealed a lesion in the right lobe of the liver. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Theodore T. Pierce: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a heterogeneous, hypoenhancing, lobulated lesion that measured 6.1 cm by 4.5 cm (Figure 1A), with imaging characteristics suggestive of primary or metastatic cancer. The lesion was associated with peripheral biliary dilatation, which suggested biliary obstruction (Figure 1B); restricted diffusion, indicating high tissue density (Figure 1C); peripheral rim enhancement on arterial phase imaging, reflecting increased vascularity at the rim of the lesion (Figure 1D); and delayed enhancement of the more central areas of the lesion, indicating fibrosis (Figure 1E and 1F). Taken together, these features are atypical of benign lesions, such as hemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatic adenoma, and are most consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial MRI of the Liver.\nPositron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT), performed after the administration of intravenous 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed FDG avidity in the hepatic mass in the right lobe.

The level of CA 19-9 was elevated, at 110 IU per milliliter (reference value, <35), but the levels of alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal. An ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy of the liver mass in the right lobe was performed, and management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Grace R. Bobkowski (Medicine): A 50-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of confusion.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 months before the current presentation, when dysphagia developed. One month later, she was evaluated by her primary care physician. She reported having a sensation that pills and food were getting stuck in her throat when she swallowed. She was unable to take her medications, and her food intake had decreased to two eggs per day. She estimated that her weight had decreased by 5 kg during the previous month. She was referred for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which reportedly revealed ulceration of the gastrojejunal junction from a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass performed 12 years earlier but otherwise normal mucosa. Examination of biopsy specimens obtained during the procedure reportedly revealed findings consistent with lymphocytic esophagitis. Treatment with swallowed fluticasone was recommended.\nThree months before the current presentation, leg swelling developed, and the patient was again evaluated by her primary care physician. She had stopped using fluticasone after 1 week of treatment because she had not noticed any decrease in the dysphagia. Her weight had decreased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month earlier. Pitting edema was present in the legs. A diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency was considered, and compression stockings were recommended.\nTwo months before the current presentation, leg swelling worsened, arm swelling developed, and the patient had trouble performing activities of daily living. She was admitted to another hospital. She reported persistent dysphagia and reduced food intake. Her weight had increased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month earlier. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The blood albumin level was 2.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.5 to 4.8), and the zinc level was 0.36 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 0.66 to 1.10). Blood levels of vitamin B2, vitamin B12, folate, and methylmalonate were normal; the blood level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide was normal for the patient\u2019s age. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The albumin:creatinine ratio in a random urine sample was 11.6 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine (reference value, <30.0).

Pitting edema of the arms and legs was attributed to hypoalbuminemia from limited oral intake, which was related to dysphagia from untreated lymphocytic esophagitis. The use of fluticasone was encouraged, and supplemental nutritional drinks were recommended, along with a multivitamin and zinc sulfate. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was discharged home.\nOne month before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to this hospital because of confusion and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Escherichia coli. Confusion resolved with treatment of the UTI. Her weight had decreased by 2 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. The patient reported loose stools without blood or mucus, which had occurred for 1 month. Edema was present. The blood albumin level was 1.7 g per deciliter, the zinc level 0.3 \u03bcg per milliliter, the selenium level 34 ng per milliliter (reference range, 70 to 150), the vitamin A level 16.6 \u03bcg per deciliter (reference range, 32.5 to 78.0), and the vitamin C level 0.2 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.4 to 2.0). Blood levels of vitamin B1 and vitamin B3 were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nEGD showed ulceration of the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. Biopsy specimens of the esophagus, stomach, and jejunum showed normal mucosa. A biopsy specimen of the gastrojejunal anastomosis showed small-intestinal mucosa with erosion and nonspecific morphologic features; periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining was negative for microorganisms, Congo red staining was negative for amyloid, and immunohistochemical staining was negative for cytomegalovirus. Magnetic resonance enterography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of active inflammatory bowel disease. A high-protein diet was recommended, along with a multivitamin, zinc sulfate, and selenium. On the eighth hospital day, the patient was discharged home.\nAfter discharge, the patient initially felt well. The edema abated, and her appetite improved. She began to have six small meals and three protein shakes per day. Two weeks after discharge, and 1 week before the current presentation, confusion developed, and the gait became unsteady; she began using a walker for ambulation. During the next week, confusion increased, and she fell while walking. Her family brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, she was unable to answer questions about her history. Her family reported that she had had slowed and slurred speech for the past week and increasing difficulty with attention, including difficulty with holding a conversation. Other medical history included chronic back pain, bipolar disorder, seizure disorder, and ulcerative colitis. Medications included carbamazepine, ergocalciferol, fluticasone, gabapentin, mesalamine, methocarbamol, mirtazapine, a multivitamin, olanzapine, omeprazole, oxycodone\u2013acetaminophen, selenium, sucralfate, thiamine, topiramate, and zinc sulfate. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was receiving disability benefits and did not work because of chronic back pain. She had smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 35 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had endometrial cancer, and her father had lung cancer.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 89/52 mm Hg, the pulse 132 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.9. Her weight had decreased by 6 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. She appeared chronically ill and was lethargic but arose in response to voice. She moved her arms and legs but did not participate in a detailed neurologic examination. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The white-cell count was 17,150 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with neutrophil predominance. The blood zinc level was 0.35 \u03bcg per milliliter, the copper level 0.28 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 0.75 to 1.45), and the vitamin B6 level less than 2 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50). Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and 50 to 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nA chest radiograph was normal, without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Urine, blood, and stool specimens were obtained for culture. Three liters of intravenous lactated Ringer\u2019s solution were administered, and the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Three hours after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, she became more lethargic and had no response to voice; she reacted to being shaken but did not open her eyes or answer questions. Additional imaging studies were performed.\nDr. Theodore T. Pierce: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed no abnormalities. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse hepatic steatosis, as well as mucosal hyperenhancement and submucosal edema involving portions of the small and large bowel, with relative sparing of the distal jejunum, proximal ileum, descending colon, and sigmoid colon.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Abdomen and Pelvis.\nDr. Bobkowski: Treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was initiated. Six hours after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, the blood pressure decreased to 85/45 mm Hg, and the heart rate increased to 132 beats per minute. There was no response to painful stimuli. Myoclonic jerking movements were observed. Treatment with norepinephrine was initiated, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The trachea was intubated for airway protection, and sedation with propofol and dexmedetomidine was initiated. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was continued; prescribed medications of carbamazepine, a multivitamin, omeprazole, selenium, sucralfate, thiamine, topiramate, and zinc sulfate were administered.\nOn the first hospital day, the blood pressure increased, and vasopressors and sedative medications were discontinued. The patient had no spontaneous interaction or speech production. She did not follow commands or grimace in response to noxious stimuli. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The corneal reflexes were intact, as were the cough and gag reflexes. There was no spontaneous movement of the arms or legs, but they withdrew in response to pain; the deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The results of CT of the head were normal. Sedation was not resumed, and serial neurologic examinations were performed.\nOn the second hospital day, leukocytosis had resolved, but the patient\u2019s mental status had not improved. Electroencephalography (EEG) with long-term monitoring revealed near-continuous generalized periodic discharges with triphasic morphologic features, often with superimposed rhythmic activity. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head were normal, as were the results of magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck. Lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed normal protein levels and no nucleated cells. The urine culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. The blood and stool cultures were negative, as was a stool test for Clostridioides difficile and an examination of the stool for ova and parasites. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was stopped, and treatment with ciprofloxacin was started.\nOn the third hospital day, the patient\u2019s mental status had not improved. EGD showed a small scar at the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. The results of flexible sigmoidoscopy were normal. Biopsy specimens of the jejunum and descending colon showed normal mucosa.\nA diagnostic test was performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Noncirrhotic hyperammonemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Sunu S. Thomas: A 26-year-old pregnant woman was transferred to this hospital for evaluation and treatment of cardiogenic shock after a cardiac arrest resulting from ventricular tachycardia.\nThe patient had had two previous uncomplicated pregnancies and was currently pregnant at 32 weeks of gestation with monochorionic, diamniotic twins. Her pregnancy had been monitored for polyhydramnios by her obstetrician with the use of serial fetal ultrasonography.\nThree weeks before presentation to this hospital, one of the patient\u2019s preschool-age children had an ear infection and the other had a sore throat. The patient had erythema in the eyes with greenish drainage, for which topical erythromycin and sulfacetamide were prescribed. One week later, a nonproductive cough complicated by a sore throat and ear pain developed. The patient also noted new edema in her legs that was not associated with pain, redness, or warmth. However, during the subsequent week, progressive pain in her right leg occurred, which prompted her to seek care at an emergency department of another hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the pulse 113 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Pitting edema of the legs was noted, with no associated erythema, warmth, or tenderness on palpation of the calves. Ultrasonography of the right leg reportedly showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and a rapid test for streptococcal antigen was negative. While the patient was in the emergency department, painful uterine contractions with back discomfort developed; the cervix was 2 cm dilated. She was admitted to the labor and delivery unit for management of preterm labor. Intramuscular betamethasone and magnesium sulfate were administered for maturation of the fetal lungs and tocolysis, respectively. Continuous intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution was initiated. Subcutaneous heparin was not administered, because delivery was thought to be imminent. After 24 hours of magnesium sulfate therapy, the uterine contractions remained unchanged, and no further cervical dilatation was noted. Because of concern about preterm labor, she remained hospitalized, with continuous monitoring of the fetal heart rate.\nFive days after admission to the labor and delivery unit, the patient had tenderness in the left leg, and the edema in both legs had worsened. She also had episodes of severe coughing but reported no chest pain or shortness of breath. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/51 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed expiratory wheezes. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Doppler ultrasound examination of the legs revealed an occlusive thrombus in the left peroneal vein. The hematology service was consulted, and an intravenous heparin infusion was initiated. Intravenous furosemide and oral azithromycin and guaifenesin were also administered.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (First Hospital), 1 Day before Transfer (First Hospital), Day of Transfer after Cardiac Arrest (First Hospital), Reference Range (This Hospital), On Arrival (This Hospital)\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 11.2\u201315.7, 10.9, 11.0, 12.0\u201316.0, 9.6\nHematocrit (%), 34.1\u201344.9, 32.5, 33.1, 36.0\u201346.0, 28.2\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 132,000, 190,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 158\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 3980\u201310,040, 8920, 12,670, 4500\u201311,000, 19,500\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l),\n\u2003Neutrophils, 1400\u20137700, 6333, 5448, 1800\u20137700, 16,302\n\u2003Lymphocytes, 1100\u20134000, 892, 3928, 1000\u20134800, 1014\n\u2003Eosinophils, 0\u2013700, 89, 127, 0\u2013900, 0\n\u2003Bands, 0\u20134, 714, 1140, 0\u20131100, 838\nSodium (mmol/liter), 136\u2013145, 135, 142, 135\u2013145, 143\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.5\u20135.1, 3.6, 3.8, 3.4\u20135.0, 4.0\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013107, 102, 108, 98\u2013108, 109\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 21\u201332, 20, 19, 23\u201332, 21\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 7\u201318, 9, 8, 8\u201325, 9\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.55\u20131.02, 0.57, 1.0, 0.60\u20131.50, 0.67\nGlucose (mg/dl), 74\u2013100, 98, 152, 70\u2013110, 202\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.1, 7.9, 7.5, 8.5\u201310.5, 6.7\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.4\u20138.2, 4.9, 5.0, 6.0\u20138.3, 3.6\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.4\u20135.0, 1.9, 1.6, 3.3\u20135.0, 1.9\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 5\u201337, 26, 44, 9\u201332, 648\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201365, 25, 31, 7\u201333, 101\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013117, 142, 141, 30\u2013100, 132\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.2\u20131.0, 0.59, 0.28, 0.0\u20131.0, 0.8\nMagnesium (mg/dl), 1.6\u20132.6, \u2014, 2.0, 1.7\u20132.4, 1.8\nProthrombin time (sec), 9.5\u201312.1, \u2014, 10.1, 11.5\u201314.5, 15.0\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.91\u20131.16, \u2014, 0.97, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.2\nPartial-thromboplastin time (sec), 23.9\u201331.3, \u2014, 73.8, 22.0\u201335.0, >150.0\nCentral venous oxygen saturation (%), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 70\u201380, 76.9\nPhosphorus (mg/dl), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 2.6\u20134.5, 4.1\nIonized calcium (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.14\u20131.30, 0.96\nGlobulin (g/dl), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.9\u20134.1, 1.3\nLactic acid (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.5\u20132.2, 1.3\nTroponin T (ng/ml), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, <0.03, 28.32\nCreatine kinase (U/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 40\u2013150, 11,012\nCreatine kinase MB isoenzyme (U/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.0\u20136.9, 552.0\nFibrinogen (mg/dl), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 150\u2013400, 259\nArterial blood gases:\n\u2003Fraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.0, \u2014, 1.0\n\u2003pH, 7.35\u20137.45, \u2014, 7.19, 7.35\u20137.45, 7.31\n\u2003Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 35\u201345, \u2014, 42.7, 35\u201342, 42\n\u2003Partial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 75\u2013100, \u2014, 251.9, 80\u2013100, 449\n\n\nThe next morning, after the patient had eaten breakfast, she had sudden severe, \u201ccrushing\u201d chest pain and became unresponsive and pulseless. Telemetry revealed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 178 beats per minute, with a right bundle-branch block pattern with a superior axis. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and after the administration of epinephrine and cardioversion, the return of spontaneous circulation was achieved within 4 minutes. Intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, propofol, and fentanyl were administered. The trachea was intubated, and ventilatory support was initiated. An emergency cesarean section was performed, and two healthy male infants were delivered, with an estimated intraoperative blood loss of 1600 ml. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Andrew S. Fox: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening, findings that were consistent with pulmonary edema; bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion; cardiomegaly with biventricular enlargement; and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery, which measured 3.8 cm in diameter. No pulmonary embolus was identified.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Chest.\nDr. Thomas: A transthoracic echocardiogram showed biventricular dilatation and severely decreased biventricular systolic function, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion. Furosemide was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to a nearby tertiary care center for further treatment.\nOn arrival at the second hospital, 210 minutes after the cardiac arrest, the pulse was 177 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure was 65 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. Physical examination was notable for diffusely coarse breath sounds, rapid regular heart sounds, and generalized edema. Thirty minutes after arrival at the second hospital, the patient underwent cannulation for femoral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and an intravenous infusion of milrinone was initiated. Ventricular tachycardia recurred; intravenous magnesium and lidocaine were administered, and the arrhythmia was terminated with cardioversion. Plans were made to transfer the patient by helicopter to this hospital, and intravenous vecuronium was given in preparation for transport. During the flight, severe vaginal bleeding developed, and 2 units of packed red cells were transfused; however, the heparin infusion was continued, given the presence of the ECMO circuit.\nOn arrival at this hospital, 10 hours after the cardiac arrest, additional information was obtained from the patient\u2019s sister and grandmother. The patient had a history of childhood asthma, obesity, anxiety, and depression. She had previously delivered two healthy, full-term children; her current pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus and polyhydramnios of one of the fetuses. Her medication history included insulin, inhaled albuterol, sertraline, iron sulfate, and folic acid. She had had no known adverse drug reactions. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was married and had two healthy preschool-age children, in addition to her two newborns. Her mother had died from ovarian cancer; her sister was healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the pulse 123 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure 76 mm Hg without intrinsic arterial pulsatility while the patient was receiving ECMO support. The respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was receiving oxygen through volume assist\u2013control mechanical ventilation, with a delivered tidal volume of 290 ml and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0. The weight was 105 kg, the height 163 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 39.5. The central venous pressure was 4 mm Hg. The pupils were equal and briskly reactive to light; once the patient was weaned off propofol, she was able to follow commands and move her arms and legs. Breath sounds were coarse bilaterally and diminished at the bases. Heart sounds were distant. The abdomen was soft and obese; no active bleeding was noted from the surgical incision, but large-volume vaginal bleeding and clots were observed. The arms and legs were warm and had moderate symmetric pitting edema. The femoral venous and arterial cannulas were secured in place in the right groin. The blood level of thyrotropin was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for influenza viruses, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus were negative.\nDr. Fox: Chest radiography (Figure 1C), performed at the time of transfer to this hospital, revealed interstitial opacities, a small left pleural effusion, and a dense retrocardiac opacity on the left side. The venous ECMO drainage cannula and a central venous catheter were visible in the right atrium.\nDr. Thomas: An electrocardiogram (Figure 2A) showed normal sinus rhythm, right bundle-branch block, borderline-low QRS voltage, and Q waves with T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads.\nFIGURE 2\n\nCardiac Studies.\nDr. Doreen DeFaria Yeh: Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 2B; and Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org), performed while the patient was receiving ECMO support, revealed a dilated left ventricular cavity with normal wall thickness and severe diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis that was most prominent in the anterior, anteroseptal, and lateral territories, with an estimated ejection fraction of 11%. Additional notable findings included moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, moderate right ventricular dysfunction and dilatation, an estimated pulmonary-artery systolic pressure of 53 mm Hg, a small pericardial effusion, and a pleural effusion. The ECMO inflow cannula was visualized in the inferior vena cava, and consistent with systemic ECMO blood flows, the aortic valve was observed not to open during the cardiac cycle, which suggested very poor native left ventricular contraction. There was no evidence of intracardiac shunting.\nDr. Thomas: The dose of milrinone was increased, and the dopamine infusion was discontinued. An oxytocin infusion and rectal misoprostol were administered. Ongoing large-volume vaginal bleeding was observed, and an intrauterine balloon was placed to control the bleeding.\nA diagnosis and management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction, probably due to spontaneous coronary-artery dissection."}, {"user_input": "Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 47-year-old right-handed man was evaluated at this hospital because of pain on the left side of the head and neck.\nSix years before the current evaluation, the patient was admitted to this hospital with 1 week of headache, pain on the left side of the neck, numbness on the left side of the face, and dizziness. The pain was not relieved with the use of ibuprofen and had previously been evaluated and treated by a chiropractor. A neurologic examination revealed a slight decrease in taste and in sensation to touch and temperature on the left side of the face; a gait evaluation revealed a subtle leftward sway. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Byung C. Yoon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed subtle foci of hypodensity in the left cerebellum, a finding suggestive of infarction. There was no evidence of arterial dissection, aneurysm, stenosis, or thrombotic occlusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, confirmed the presence of a left medial cerebellar infarct and a small left lateral medullary infarct (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C).\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI and CT Angiogram.\nDr. Dudzinski: The patient had normal results on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, echocardiography, and a hypercoagulability panel, except for a mildly elevated level of anticardiolipin IgM (18.9 IgM phospholipid units; reference range, 0 to 15). During the hospital admission, lesions with a vesicular appearance developed on the left side of the lips and oral cavity, and the patient was treated with famciclovir. He was discharged home while receiving aspirin, with a follow-up visit scheduled in the neurology clinic.\nOne month later in the neurology clinic, the patient reported partial resolution of headache, persistent neck pain and ear pain with balance difficulty, and perioral paresthesia. There was diminished sensation on the left side of the face (similar to that observed during the previous examination). No oropharyngeal lesions were visible. An evaluation of gait and balance was normal.\nDr. Yoon: Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed expected evolution of the left cerebellar infarct and no new infarction. The left posterior inferior cerebellar artery was not visualized, possibly because of occlusion or slow blood flow.\nDr. Dudzinski: Repeat CSF analysis showed normal protein and glucose levels and 14 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 94% were lymphocytes. Gram\u2019s staining showed no organisms. CSF tests for borrelia and varicella DNA and for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus antibodies were negative. Two days later, cerebral angiography revealed mild narrowing of the origin of the left vertebral artery. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-La and anti-Ro antibodies were negative, as was a rapid plasma reagin test.\nThe patient received follow-up care at another hospital until the current evaluation, when he presented to the emergency department of this hospital with 3 days of severe pain on exertion that affected the left side of the neck and left temporo-occipital region. The symptoms were similar to those he had reported in the past and were not relieved with the use of ibuprofen or marijuana. The head pain was described as pulsating and pounding, and it worsened when he was in the supine position.\nThe patient reported right flank pain; the onset of this pain had occurred with lifting of a heavy object and had just preceded the onset of headache. He also reported a tendency to bruise. The review of systems was otherwise normal. His medical history was notable for dyslipidemia. He had undergone repair of meniscus tears in both knees and repair of a traumatic dislocation of the right shoulder. Medications included rosuvastatin and gemfibrozil, as well as acetaminophen as needed. There were no known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was a self-employed laborer and lived with his wife and children in a suburb of Boston. He smoked cigars and marijuana occasionally, and he drank up to eight beers per day on weekends. His family history was notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia in both of his parents, as well as early-onset dementia in his father.\nThe temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 176/119 mm Hg in both arms, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A neurologic examination revealed a mild decrease in coordination in the left hand but was otherwise normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, troponin T, C-reactive protein, lipoprotein(a), and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of renal function tests.

There was no evidence of acute ischemia. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of infarction or a perfusion abnormality. However, a T1-weighted image showed a focus of intrinsic hyperintensity along the left vertebral artery, a finding consistent with hemorrhage within the vessel wall from the dissection (Figure 1F).\nDr. Dudzinski: The patient was admitted to the neurology service. Control of the blood pressure required multiple medications. Echocardiography showed no cardiac, valvular, or aortic structural abnormality. Right flank pain recurred. Urinalysis showed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field but was otherwise normal.\nDr. Yoon: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dissection of the right renal artery, extending from the origin of the artery to subsegmental renal arteries. Perinephric fat stranding was present on the right side, and there were areas of diminished enhancement in the right kidney.

Lu (Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear): A 61-year-old man was evaluated in an ophthalmology clinic affiliated with this hospital because of eyelid swelling.\nEight years before the current presentation, the patient noticed mild puffiness of the eyelids that was worst in the morning and typically resolved by midday. Five years before the current presentation, the eyelid swelling began to progressively worsen and to last throughout the day. The patient had a history of glaucoma; when the eyelid swelling began to interfere with his vision, he asked for a consultation with the ophthalmologist who had treated his glaucoma. A diagnosis of dermatochalasis with fat prolapse was suspected, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery clinic affiliated with this hospital for consideration of blepharoplasty.\nIn the clinic, the patient reported that eyelid puffiness was interfering with his ability to read and drive. He did not have dry eye. He had a sensation of pressure behind the eyes and intermittent double vision. There was generalized joint stiffness in the mornings that resolved after 1 hour. There was left lateral hip pain that radiated to the left buttock and thigh, with associated paresthesia in the left foot.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection had been diagnosed 31 years before the current presentation and was well controlled with antiretroviral therapy, although lipodystrophy had occurred with treatment. Other medical history included carpal tunnel syndrome, cataracts, depression, dyslipidemia, hypertension, allergic rhinitis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma, in addition to primary open-angle glaucoma. Surgical history included carpal tunnel release surgery (performed 2 months before the current presentation), intraocular lens replacement in both eyes, and lipectomy for the reduction of dorsocervical lipohypertrophy due to lipodystrophy. Medications included antiretroviral therapy (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide), bupropion, fluoxetine, triamterene, amlodipine, atorvastatin, inhaled albuterol, and topical testosterone. The administration of iodinated contrast material had caused hives. The patient lived part time in Florida and part time in New England. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit substances.\nOn examination, the corrected visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light. Confrontation testing revealed deficits in the outer superior temporal visual fields and the superior nasal visual fields, which abated with manual elevation of the eyelids. Supraduction and abduction were limited in both eyes. Soft edema of the upper and lower eyelids was present, along with mild erythema of the upper eyelids (Figure 1). The upper-eyelid skin was overhanging the lashes medially, a finding indicative of dermatochalasis. There was upper-eyelid ptosis. The globes were moderately resistant to retropulsion, and there was mild proptosis. The levator palpebrae superioris muscles had impaired function, with an eyelid elevation of 8 mm in the right eye and 11 mm in the left eye (reference range, 12 to 18). Slit-lamp examination revealed 1+ chemosis and trace injection in the conjunctivae; there was no evidence of superficial punctate keratopathy or cells in the anterior chambers. Funduscopic examination revealed an increased cup-to-disk ratio in the optic nerves, a finding consistent with the patient\u2019s known history of glaucoma. The tongue was enlarged, and there was dorsocervical lipohypertrophy on the posterior aspect of the neck.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs at Presentation.\nThe blood levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins were normal.

He had had developmental delay, was nonverbal, and required supervision while walking because of a slow, shuffling gait with associated falls.\nThe patient was in his usual state of health until 2 months before this admission, when his parents noticed swelling of the left foot after a fall. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital, and radiography of the left foot was reportedly normal.\nTwo weeks before this admission, swelling of the left foot increased. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician, and additional imaging of the foot was recommended. The patient was already scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (which was planned to be performed with the patient under general anesthesia) as part of a research study for patients with the Dravet syndrome.1 MRI of the left foot was performed at the same time.\nDr. Teresa Victoria: MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse cerebral volume loss. There were incidental secretions filling the sphenoid and frontal sinuses that had heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted images and hyperintense signal intensity on T1-weighted images; mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses was also noted. MRI of the left foot, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal bone marrow edema in the midfoot and hindfoot. There was no fracture, dislocation, or joint effusion.\nDr. Lerner: Treatment with amoxicillin was initiated by the patient\u2019s primary care physician to treat possible sinusitis. Seven days before this admission, the patient\u2019s parents noticed increased swelling and new warmth of the left foot, and the patient appeared uncomfortable when bearing weight on that foot.

He had intermittent diaphoresis and tachycardia, and the frequency of seizures had increased from one every 2 to 3 days to two or three seizures daily. One day before this admission, the oral temperature measured at home was 38.1\u00b0C. After a telephone consultation with the patient\u2019s primary care physician, treatment with amoxicillin was changed to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate. The seizure frequency did not decrease, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nAdditional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. They had not observed nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or cough. The patient had gingivitis that had recently worsened; during the 2 weeks before this admission, there had been new bleeding from the gums and bleeding from the nose. The patient was following a ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment for seizures; because of multiple food allergies, the ketogenic formula was administered through a gastrostomy tube. He had loose stools, which the parents attributed to tube feeding; the stools were unchanged in volume and frequency. He had had two episodes of nonbilious, nonbloody emesis during the week before this admission.\nThe patient\u2019s parents also reported that 7 months before this admission, the patient had begun to have fever, vomiting, and increased volume and frequency of stools; coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was diagnosed, and the volume of the ketogenic formula was decreased by half for 4 days until vomiting resolved. Medications included amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, cannabidiol, clobazam, famotidine, glycopyrrolate, levocarnitine, levocetirizine, a multivitamin, potassium citrate, and phosphorus, as well as lorazepam as needed for seizures lasting longer than several minutes.

Stool testing for Clostridium difficile antigen and toxin was negative, as was a stool examination for ova and parasites. Specimens of blood and stool were sent for culture. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest revealed a patchy opacity in the right lung base. Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed diffuse bone demineralization and fractures of the second metatarsal and cuboid, findings that were similar to those seen on previous imaging. There was sclerosis in the proximal first and distal fourth and fifth metatarsals that was suggestive of new fractures. A crescentic osseous fragment was thought to be an avulsed fragment of bone.\nDr. Lerner: A diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made, treatment with intravenous fluids and ampicillin\u2013sulbactam was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 7 days, he had no fever, but tachycardia persisted. Blood cultures showed no growth, and stool cultures showed normal intestinal flora. The CRP level had increased to 108.1 mg per liter, the d-dimer level was 6953 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500), and the hemoglobin level had decreased to 7.0 g per deciliter.

She was evaluated in the oncology clinic of another hospital, and mammography and ultrasonography of the right breast confirmed the presence of a mass. A core-needle biopsy was performed, and pathological examination of the specimen revealed invasive ductal carcinoma with no lymphovascular invasion. Lumpectomy of the right breast, along with sentinel-node biopsy of the right axilla, was performed.\nDr. Baris Boyraz: Pathological examination of the specimen that was obtained by means of lumpectomy confirmed the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient\u2019s tumor was grade 3 (measuring 2.5 cm in diameter), negative for estrogen receptor, weakly positive (<5% of tumor cells) for progesterone receptor, and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), findings consistent with a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer. Three sentinel lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma, and there was no lymphovascular invasion. Genetic testing revealed no pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.\nDr. Oh: The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, followed by radiation therapy to the right breast. During the subsequent 3.5 years, surveillance imaging showed no evidence of disease recurrence.\nEighteen months before the current presentation, weakness and numbness developed in the left arm and resolved spontaneously after 15 minutes. During the subsequent 4 weeks, the patient had similar episodes of left-arm weakness and numbness, which occurred 1 or 2 times per week. When the episodes did not abate, she sought evaluation in the emergency department of the other hospital. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Karen Rodriguez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a partially cystic mass in the right precentral gyrus. The mass measured 3.5 cm in diameter, with peripheral enhancement and local mass effect.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Head and Chest.\nDr. Oh: The patient was transferred to this hospital for neurosurgical management. The episodes of arm weakness and numbness were attributed to seizures; treatment with dexamethasone and levetiracetam was started. Right frontal craniotomy was performed, and the mass was resected.\nDr. Boyraz: Pathological examination of tissue obtained from the resected mass (Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C) revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive mitotic and apoptotic activity. The tumor cells had patchy positivity for GATA-3, a transcription factor expressed by breast tissue, which supported a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma originating in the breast. Further studies revealed the tumor to be estrogen-receptor\u2013negative and progesterone-receptor\u2013negative, with a HER2 score on immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of 1+ (incomplete, faint membrane staining in >10% of tumor cells), and programmed death ligand 1 expression of less than 1%, findings that are consistent with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Next-generation sequencing revealed variants in FOXL2, CCND3, TP53, and FLT3. An RNA fusion assay did not show fusion transcripts.\nFIGURE 2\n\nBiopsy Specimens of the Brain Mass and Lung.\nDr. Rodriguez: Positron-emission tomography\u2013computed tomography (PET-CT) (Figure 1B and 1C), performed after the administration of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, showed a conglomerate lymph-node mass in the right perihilar region with intense FDG avidity.\nDr. Oh: After surgery, the patient had an uneventful recovery, and the episodes of weakness and numbness resolved. She was discharged home with planned follow-up in the oncology clinic. Radiation therapy was administered to the brain, and treatment with capecitabine was initiated. However, 11 months before the current presentation, the episodes recurred. The dose of levetiracetam was increased, and additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Rodriguez: MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple new enhancing lesions with features consistent with metastasis, including a lesion in the right occipital lobe that measured 3 mm in diameter. Postsurgical changes related to the craniotomy on the right side and the resection of the mass in the right precentral gyrus were also present.\nDr. Oh: Stereotactic radiosurgery to the right occipital metastasis was performed.\nDr. Rodriguez: Seven months before the current presentation, PET-CT, performed after the administration of FDG tracer, showed an increase in the size of the right perihilar mass with intense FDG avidity, as well as new FDG avidity in a right lower paratracheal lymph node.\nDr. Oh: Treatment with capecitabine was discontinued. The patient was enrolled in a clinical trial, and treatment with oral paclitaxel was initiated (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03326102).\nDr. Rodriguez: Five months before the current presentation, MRI of the head revealed a new enhancing lesion in the right superior frontal gyrus, measuring 7 mm in diameter. The right occipital lesion was not seen.\nDr. Oh: The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to the right frontal metastasis. During the subsequent 5 months, treatment with oral paclitaxel was continued.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, nonproductive cough developed. There was no shortness of breath, orthopnea, or chest pain.

In addition, there was severe narrowing of the right superior pulmonary vein.\nDr. Oh: Treatment with oral paclitaxel was stopped, and the patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to the metastasis involving the left frontal lobe.\nManagement decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Triple-negative breast cancer with metastasis to the lung and brain."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Beatriz Rizkallah Alves (Neurology): A 71-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital for neurosurgical evaluation because of confusion, aphasia, and a mass lesion in the brain.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current presentation, when headache and fatigue developed. The next day, she was typing on a computer at her workplace when she suddenly noticed that her typed words were incoherent. The episode of confusion and language production difficulties resolved after a few minutes. Confusion recurred in the evening while the patient was at dinner with her husband, and she sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Examination was reportedly normal.\nDr. Jeremy N. Ford: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, and CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed a large area of attenuation in the left posterior superior frontal lobe.\nDr. Alves: The patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nDr. Ford: On hospital day 2, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left frontal lobe with vasogenic edema and mass effect. A diagnosis of cancer with metastases to the brain was considered, and additional imaging studies were obtained. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly showed a pulmonary nodule that measured 0.2 cm in diameter and a nodule in the right breast that measured 1.3 cm in diameter. The appearance of the breast nodule was unchanged from that observed on imaging performed 8 years before the current presentation, except for the presence of a new punctate calcification along the anterior margin.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head Obtained on Hospital Day 2.\nOn hospital day 3, expressive aphasia developed. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly showed increased edema and mass effect that corresponded to the abnormality in the left frontal lobe.\nDr. Alves: Treatment with dexamethasone and levetiracetam was started. The patient received one dose of each medication before she was transferred to the neurosurgical unit of this hospital for evaluation and possible brain biopsy.\nThe patient had a history of myasthenia gravis, vitamin B12 deficiency, and hypertension. Surgical history included supracervical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine fibroids (performed 31 years before the current presentation), transsternal thymectomy and wedge resection of the right upper lobe for a cortical thymoma (22 years before the current presentation), and sigmoid colectomy for recurrent diverticulitis (7 years before the current presentation). Ocular-predominant myasthenia gravis was diagnosed 18 years before the current presentation and 4 years after thymectomy. Myasthenia gravis had been treated for 11 years with cyclosporine and pyridostigmine. Seven years before the current presentation, a flare of myasthenia gravis was complicated by respiratory failure, for which the patient received bilevel positive airway pressure and underwent plasmapheresis. After that hospitalization, cyclosporine therapy was replaced by mycophenolate mofetil, which she had been taking daily for the past 7 years.\nOther medications included cholecalciferol, latanoprost ophthalmic drops, hydrochlorothiazide, polysaccharide\u2013iron complex capsules, and monthly intramuscular vitamin B12 injections. Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate had previously caused rash. The patient lived in the northeastern United States, was married, and worked in an office. She had recently traveled to California for a wedding, and she reported no exposures to animals or fresh water. She had not had any recent dental procedures. She had no history of tobacco use or injection drug use. She rarely consumed alcoholic beverages. Her mother had systemic lupus erythematosus, and her father had lung cancer. A sister had rheumatoid arthritis.\nOn examination, the oral temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 150/80 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Severe expressive aphasia was observed, and she followed commands intermittently. Orientation could not be accurately assessed. She had disconjugate gaze at rest. Motor strength was 5/5 in the left arm and left leg and 4/5 in the right arm and right leg. The blood level of glucose was normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of phosphorus was 2.2 mg per deciliter (reference range, 2.6 to 4.5). The complete blood count was normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation.\nElectroencephalography showed intermittent irregular delta slowing focally over the left frontal region but no epileptiform abnormalities. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed ill-defined parenchymal hypoattenuation involving the left superior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and left centrum semiovale with associated sulcal effacement. Treatment with dexamethasone, hydrochlorothiazide, mycophenolate mofetil, and pyridostigmine was stopped, as was treatment with cholecalciferol, latanoprost drops, polysaccharide\u2013iron complex, and vitamin B12. Treatment with levetiracetam was continued, and empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin was started.\nDr. Gavin P. Dunn: A left frontal craniotomy with open brain biopsy was planned to allow for sufficient lesional tissue to be obtained and to enable further debulking to be performed, pending intraoperative findings and the results of pathological assessment. A small craniotomy centered at the coronal suture directly over the target lesion was performed. The lesion appeared gray, and tissue that appeared abnormal was sampled in several locations of the lesion. Direct microscopic visualization of the specimens identified areas that did not appear to be completely distinct from normal tissue, and thus, further debulking was not indicated. No purulence was noted.\nDr. Christopher W. Mount: Intraoperative examination of a frozen section (Figure 2) revealed a cellular infiltrate consisting of atypical cells in a focal perivascular arrangement. No evidence of pathologically significant acute inflammation was present in the tissue. At this time, these features suggested the presence of a malignant infiltrate. Additional specimens were submitted to the pathology department for formalin fixation and interpretation.\nFIGURE 2\n\nFrozen Section of Brain Tissue.\nDr. Alves: A diagnosis of lymphoma was considered, and treatment with dexamethasone administered intravenously every 6 hours was started. On postoperative day 1, new facial droop on the right side developed, along with weakness with cervical flexion and monoplegia of the right arm.\nDr. Ford: Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 3), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed postsurgical changes in the left frontal lobe and susceptibility artifact at the biopsy site that was consistent with blood products. There was enlargement of the expansile lesion in the left frontal lobe that corresponded to an area of hyperintensity on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging.\nFIGURE 3\n\nMRI of the Head Obtained on Postoperative Day 1.\nDr. Alves: A diagnostic test was performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Brain abscess due to infection with Listeria monocytogenes.\n"}, {"user_input": "Dr. Lucas X. Marinacci: A 72-year-old woman was evaluated for dysarthria and respiratory failure during an admission to this hospital, which had occurred before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nTwo years before the current evaluation, the patient presented to her primary care physician at this hospital with subacute exertional dyspnea, which had been present for more than a year but had progressively worsened during the past several months. The oxygen saturation was 91 to 94% while she was walking. She had edema in both legs. The white-cell count, platelet count, and blood levels of electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, and hemoglobin were normal, as were test results for kidney function.\nDr. Sandra P. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and bilateral interstitial opacities.\nDr. Marinacci: Hydrochlorothiazide was prescribed. At a follow-up evaluation 2 weeks later, the patient\u2019s weight had decreased by 5 kg, but the exertional dyspnea and bilateral leg edema were unchanged. The N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide level was normal, and the d-dimer level was 3259 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500).\nDr. Rincon: Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no pulmonary emboli. A dilated main pulmonary artery, mosaic attenuation of the lungs, and coronary-artery calcifications were present.\nDr. Marinacci: Four weeks later, the patient presented to her primary care physician with increased exertional dyspnea. Her weight had decreased by 2 kg. The peak expiratory flow was 220 liters per second (expected value according to age, sex, and height, 350). A tapering course of prednisone and inhaled albuterol were prescribed, and her condition improved initially.\nThe patient was lost to follow-up; her next visit took place 10 months before the current evaluation. At that time, the patient reported recurrent exertional dyspnea, which occurred when she moved from room to room. She reported an episode of transient facial asymmetry with saliva dripping from the left side of her mouth that had developed while she was washing herself; later that day, her sister had noticed that she was slurring words during a telephone call. The white-cell count, platelet count, and blood levels of thyrotropin, glycated hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, and hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

An examination was notable for diffuse crackles in both lung fields.\nDr. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed pulmonary edema and a small right pleural effusion.\nDr. Marinacci: Intravenous furosemide was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal biventricular wall thickness, size, and function. Mild biatrial enlargement, a patent foramen ovale with mild left-to-right shunting, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg were noted.\nOn the day before the current evaluation, the patient called her primary care physician to report sore throat with difficulty swallowing that had started 2 days earlier. Because she had slurred speech over the phone, she was referred to the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported dysphagia with food, liquids, and medications. Her daughter reported that her voice had sounded \u201cgarbled\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d during the preceding days and also during an episode of transient dysarthria that had developed a few months earlier. Dyspnea and mild leg edema had been present for at least 3 years, along with some orthopnea and an intermittent nonproductive cough. The patient had started using a walker in the past year owing to exertional fatigue, arthritic pain, and weakness in both legs. Two falls had occurred in the previous 8 months. In addition, the patient reported increased generalized weakness and limb weakness, daytime somnolence, and fatigue. She had no diplopia, numbness, dizziness, headache, chest pain, palpitations, bleeding, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for severe obesity, coronary-artery calcifications, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial flutter, and hyperparathyroidism. Medications included furosemide, apixaban, aspirin, amlodipine, lisinopril, metoprolol, lovastatin, metformin, and sertraline. She had had no known adverse drug reactions. The patient was retired and divorced, and she lived alone in an assisted-living community. She had smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 15 years but had quit smoking 20 years earlier, and she did not drink alcohol or use other substances. Her family history was notable for ischemic heart disease. Her father had had myocardial infarctions; a paternal cousin had systemic lupus erythematosus.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 76 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/88 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 124 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 53.1. The patient was appropriately oriented, and her speech was fluent. She appeared to have increased work of breathing. The oropharynx was clear; no stridor was noted. Auscultation revealed an irregular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur at the base of the left sternal border and crackles in both lungs. The patient had pitting edema in both legs with venous stasis dermatitis and had tenderness of the knees with mild crepitus but no erythema or effusion.\nThe white-cell count, platelet count, and blood levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphate, creatine kinase, lactate, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, globulin, lipase, and hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 1+ protein. Testing of an oropharyngeal swab for group A streptococcal antigen was negative, and a throat culture showed no growth.\nDr. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, low lung volumes, and bilateral interstitial opacities (Figure 1A).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Marinacci: Electrocardiography was notable for atrial flutter with a ventricular rate of 75 beats per minute, a rightward axis, and low precordial QRS voltage. On the first night in the emergency department, the patient was unable to lie flat to sleep because of dyspnea. Intravenous furosemide was administered, along with continuous positive airway pressure (with a pressure of 10 cm of water and a rate of 4 liters of oxygen per minute). Cardiology and neurology consultations were requested.\nDr. Rincon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head and CTA of the head and neck showed chronic lacunar infarcts and chronic hypertensive microangiopathy (Figure 1B). No high-grade stenosis or large-vessel occlusion was noted. CT of the neck and mediastinum showed no mass or lymphadenopathy (Figure 1C).\nDr. Marinacci: On the second day, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of slurred speech, voice changes, and dyspnea. The examination was notable for tachypnea and a new onset of forgetfulness. The dysarthria was most pronounced with guttural sounds. She also had facial droop on the right side, subtle ptosis in the right eye, slight weakness in the proximal muscles on both sides, pronator drift on the left side, and the Babinski reflex in the right foot. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Rincon: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck showed findings similar to those seen on CT. No evidence of acute infarction was noted (Figure 1D). Scattered foci of susceptibility signal were present in the cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, and thalami, findings consistent with chronic microhemorrhages. MRA showed widely patent intracranial and cervical arteries (Figure 1E and 1F).\nDr. Marinacci: On the third day, the patient was somnolent and was using accessory muscles for breathing until bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated. An evaluation revealed weak cough and delayed swallow initiation. Owing to the degree of dysphagia, it was recommended that the patient avoid oral medications and food. The thyrotropin level was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Direct laryngoscopy showed an impaired swallow, normal vocal cords, and no mass or other source of obstruction. Intravenous furosemide and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam and inhaled ipratropium were administered.\nDiagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Myasthenia gravis."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Leontios Pappas (Medicine): An 80-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of pancytopenia and the identification of schistocytes on a peripheral-blood smear.\nSix weeks before admission to this hospital, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, along with chills and subjective fever. The symptoms resolved after 4 days without specific intervention, but then intermittent dysphagia with solid foods and early satiety developed. During the next 4 weeks, the patient had gradually progressive fatigue and light-headedness. The fatigue progressed to the point that she could no longer stay at work for more than a few hours; she presented to another hospital for evaluation.\nAt the other hospital, the patient reported that she had ongoing fatigue and had lost 6 kg of weight over a 5-week period. On examination, the temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the weight 55.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.9.

Dhami: A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed a small hiatal hernia, multiple simple cysts in the right kidney, and indeterminate bilateral pelvic masses measuring 4.8 cm in diameter on the right side and 6.3 cm in diameter on the left side (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Abdomen and Pelvis.\nDr. Pappas: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level decreased to 6.6 g per deciliter, and two units of packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed diffuse esophageal inflammation with white exudates throughout the esophagus; examination of brushings revealed yeast consistent with candida, and treatment with fluconazole was initiated.\nDuring the next 3 hospital days, the patient continued to feel unwell, with persistent fever and limited oral intake due to odynophagia, and the administration of intravenous fluids was continued. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. On hospital day 5, empirical therapy with doxycycline was started because of concerns about a possible tickborne illness.\nOn hospital day 6, the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 94% when oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening, findings consistent with pulmonary edema, along with bilateral pleural effusions of a small to moderate size. The administration of intravenous fluids was stopped, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was provided.\nOn hospital day 7, fever resolved but pancytopenia persisted. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a moderate amount of schistocytes, severe anisocytosis, large platelets, and an increased amount of bands without blasts. Direct and indirect Coombs\u2019 tests were negative, as were nucleic acid tests for babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, cobalamin, folate, homocysteine, and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The results of serologic tests for Epstein\u2013Barr virus were consistent with previous infection. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed phenotypically normal myeloid cells; there was an increased amount of atypical CD34+ myeloblasts, which accounted for less than 1% of leukocytes and were of unclear clinical significance.\nA tunneled catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and plasma exchange was initiated for the treatment of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Total parenteral nutrition was also initiated, because oral intake was still limited by odynophagia.\nOn hospital day 8, oral intake of soft foods and liquids increased. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, as well as a mildly thickened aortic valve with no stenosis or regurgitation; there was trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. On hospital day 9, the patient underwent additional plasma exchange and was transferred to this hospital for further care.\nOn evaluation in this hospital, the patient reported that her energy level had increased. She recalled that she had felt mildly confused at the other hospital, but the confusion had since resolved. She had had no gum bleeding or blood in the stool or urine. Other medical history included hypertension and dyslipidemia. Surgical history included hysterectomy at 40 years of age, with no vaginal bleeding since the procedure.\nOne year earlier, routine laboratory testing had revealed mild thrombocytopenia and anemia. A bone marrow biopsy performed at that time had revealed slightly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis but with some erythroid abnormalities and occasional hyperchromatic megakaryocytes; cytogenetic analysis had shown a loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and a gain of chromosome 8 in 65% of the cells. Thereafter, blood counts monitored every 4 months, including 4 months before this presentation, had remained stable; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nMedications included amlodipine, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. She had smoked tobacco for 50 years but had quit 5 years before this presentation. She was widowed and lived alone in New England; her work involved cleaning a church several days a week. Her sister had had breast cancer at 30 years of age, and a brother had had testicular cancer at a young age and liver cancer at 55 years of age.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 150/65 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented, and she did not appear ill. There were no petechiae. There was no bleeding at the site of tunneled catheter placement in the right internal jugular vein. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard at the left lower sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nExamination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes, anisocytosis, and a low platelet count, with large platelets present; the white cells appeared normal, and there were no blasts (Figure 2). The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. The levels of serum free kappa and lambda light chains were increased, with a normal ratio. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. Urinalysis showed 2+ urobilinogen, without bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, protein, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Consultation was obtained from the gynecology service regarding the bilateral pelvic masses noted on CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Blood levels of CA 125, CA 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal, and follow-up in the gynecology clinic was recommended for further evaluation after discharge.

Bilateral, frontal, pulsatile headache developed suddenly and reached maximal intensity within seconds. The patient rated the pain at 10 (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain) and noted that it was the worst headache pain that she had ever had. The pain was so severe that she could not complete her sentence. She sat down, feeling as though she might faint because of the severity of the pain. She repeatedly told her husband, \u201cSomething is really wrong.\u201d Nausea developed without emesis. When the symptoms did not abate after 30 minutes, emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing headache and nausea. Medical history included hypertension and cervical disk disease with chronic neck pain. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide and oral conjugated estrogens, which the patient took every 3 days for symptoms of menopause. She had no known allergies. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. She lived with her husband and worked as an administrative assistant. Her mother had diabetes. There was no family history of venous thromboembolism.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 157/77 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The neck was supple. She was oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. The visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The visualized portions of the retina were normal in both eyes with normal-appearing optic disks. Tests of motor strength and sensation showed normal results, as did tests of reflexes and cerebellar function. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count with differential count and the results of tests of kidney function and coagulation. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Javier M. Romero: Two hours after the onset of headache, computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1), revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left superior parietal lobule and paramedian parietal sulci.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT Scan of the Head, Obtained during the Initial Presentation.\nDr. DiCarlo: Treatment with intravenous morphine and promethazine was administered. Nausea resolved, and the headache pain abated. Four hours after the onset of headache, the blood pressure was 136/45 mm Hg. Additional laboratory studies were obtained. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 8 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), the blood level of C-reactive protein 2.7 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the blood level of troponin T 0.36 ng per milliliter (reference value, <0.03). Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block and diffuse submillimeter ST-segment depressions.\nAdditional testing was performed, and a diagnosis was made.", "ground_truth_output": "Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome with takotsubo cardiomyopathy."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Claudio M. de Gusmao: A 69-year-old man was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of progressively worsening ataxia.\nThe patient had been well until 9 years before this evaluation, when abnormal gait and impaired coordination developed. He was unable to walk in a straight line; he bumped into walls when walking down a hallway. He also had difficulty reading traffic signs while driving and noted a change in the quality of his voice. The patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of another hospital and began physical therapy.\nDuring the next several years, symptoms gradually worsened despite physical therapy. The patient was no longer able to drive or play golf, and he intermittently used a walker because of unsteadiness. He had frequent falls, including one that led to fractures in six ribs. His speech changes worsened, such that he could no longer sing. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the neurology clinic, the patient reported frequent bowel movements, approximately 10 per day. He had no vertigo, lightheadedness, hearing loss, tremor, erectile dysfunction, disturbance of sleep, or urinary incontinence. He reported a sense of visual disorientation with head movement and with changes in the direction of gaze. He had a history of hyperlipidemia. Medications included atorvastatin, cetirizine, and a multivitamin; there were no known drug allergies. The patient had recently moved from an urban area in the southeastern United States to a suburban area of New England. He drank one glass of wine nightly; additional alcohol use caused worsening of ataxia and dysarthria. He had previously smoked five cigarettes daily but had quit smoking 30 years before this evaluation; he did not use illicit drugs.\nThe patient\u2019s mother had died of heart failure at an elderly age, and his father had died after a stroke and myocardial infarction at 70 years of age. The patient had two adult children, who were healthy. His two brothers and one of his sisters had celiac disease; the sister also reportedly had a shuffling gait. The sister\u2019s daughter had received a diagnosis of Turner\u2019s syndrome and had been seen by a neurologist for a balance disturbance. A brother\u2019s grandson also had celiac disease and a gait disturbance (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nFamily History.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg, and the pulse 72 beats per minute. The patient was alert, oriented, and attentive and provided a detailed history. He had moderate dysarthria, with impairment in the rate, rhythm, and clarity of speech. An oculomotor examination revealed complete and conjugate gaze in all directions; he had intact smooth pursuit movements but had slow, dysmetric saccades. Results of a head impulse test were abnormal, with corrective saccades noted bilaterally. Normal tone and full strength were present in all major muscle groups of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric at the knees but absent at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Rapid tapping of the index fingers on the thumbs was dysrhythmic and uncoordinated. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing revealed mild intention tremor. Heel-to-shin testing revealed symmetric jerking movements with lateral movements across the shins. Vibration and joint-position senses in the legs were profoundly decreased: the patient was unable to sense vibration at the toes, had a decreased ability to sense vibration at the knees, and had difficulty discerning the position of his big toe with his eyes closed. There was sway in his stance, regardless of whether his eyes were open, and he could not stand with the feet together. The patient walked without support. He had a wide-based gait with considerable staggering and jerky, stiff movements of the legs. He was unable to maintain balance in a tandem stance or to walk with a tandem gait.\nThe complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were test results for kidney, liver, and thyroid function; antibodies to thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin were not detected. Blood levels of cyanocobalamin, methylmalonic acid, vitamin E, and glycated hemoglobin were normal; anti\u2013glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were not detected. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Genetic testing revealed no mutations in genes associated with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8. Clinical testing of otolith function revealed abnormal vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials on the left side. Nerve-conduction studies revealed absent or barely detectable responses in the bilateral sural nerves, left superficial peroneal nerve, left median nerve, left ulnar nerve, and right radial nerve. Results of motor nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were results of a modified barium-swallow evaluation. A previous workup at another hospital for chronic diarrhea had reportedly been normal, with no evidence of malabsorption.\nDr. McKinley Glover: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss and prominent cerebellar volume loss, most notably involving the vermis and superior cerebellar hemispheres. There was mild flattening of the superior margin of the midbrain, and the ratio of midbrain to ventral pons was mildly reduced at 0.51 (reference range, >0.52).1 The anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain was 8.90 mm (reference range, >9.35).1 There was no abnormal signal in the pons, and the middle cerebellar peduncles were normal. There was a chronic lacunar infarct of the right thalamus.\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. de Gusmao: Additional history was obtained, and a diagnosis was made.", "ground_truth_output": "Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome due to a biallelic expansion in RFC1."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Alba Coraini (Neurology): A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of back pain and leg stiffness.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 years before the current presentation, when stiffness in the back and upper legs developed abruptly while she attempted to rise from a seated position. She also began to have associated low back pain that worsened with bending the knees or climbing stairs. During the next several months, back and leg stiffness waxed and waned; at times, the patient could walk normally and engage in running for exercise, and at other times, she was unable to walk because her knees felt as though they had \u201clocked up.\u201d Two months after the onset of symptoms, the patient fell and broke her right arm. She perceived the fall as being unusual in that after she tripped, she was unable to prevent herself from falling because of tension in her legs. After the fall, the patient underwent physical therapy for several months, but she did not resume running for exercise because of a fear of falling.\nTwo and a half years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in a rheumatology clinic of another hospital. Passive flexion of the left knee was guarded, but the knee bent when a distraction technique was used; the remainder of the examination was normal. Hip and knee radiographs were reportedly unremarkable. The knee stiffness was not thought to be due to an underlying rheumatologic disorder.\nOne and a half years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated for knee pain in the sports medicine clinic affiliated with this hospital. The pain was localized to the anterior portions of the knees at the level of the patellae; it worsened with climbing stairs and resolved with rest. Examination and radiographs of the knees showed no abnormalities. Patellofemoral pain syndrome was diagnosed, and physical therapy was recommended. The knee pain resolved after physical therapy, but the patient continued to have leg stiffness and did not return to running owing to a fear of falling.\nThree months before the current presentation, the patient noticed ongoing lower back pain and increased stiffness in the legs that was worse in the right leg. She felt unsteady on her feet and worried about tripping while walking or falling while climbing stairs. While walking in her house, she hit her leg on a coffee table; both legs stiffened, and she fell, striking her face on the floor. There was no loss of consciousness. She was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, she had mild tenderness on palpation of the lumbar spine. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed normal paraspinal soft tissues and exaggeration of the normal lumbar lordosis, with preserved vertebral height. A loss of normal signal intensity was noted in the L4\u2013L5 intervertebral disk space on T2-weighted images, a finding that was consistent with mild degeneration. Evaluation for signal abnormality in the visible portion of the spinal cord and in the cauda equina nerve roots could not be assessed owing to severe motion artifact. There was no evidence of high-grade spinal canal or foraminal stenosis.\nDr. Coraini: Treatment with cyclobenzaprine, which was to be taken as needed at night for back pain, was initiated, and physical therapy was recommended. However, after 3 months of physical therapy, the back pain had not abated, and the leg stiffness had worsened. The patient sought evaluation in the neurology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the neurology clinic, the patient reported ongoing leg stiffness and rigidity that caused gait abnormalities. She noticed jerking movements at night as she was falling asleep. Three months before the current evaluation, she had taken lorazepam for claustrophobia before entering the MRI machine for spinal imaging, and her gait was reportedly normal for several hours after imaging.\nThe patient had a history of vitiligo, eczema, and alopecia areata. Graves\u2019 disease, for which she had been treated with methimazole, was in remission. Immune thrombocytopenia, which had been diagnosed 7 years before the current presentation, had been treated with a course of intravenous immune globulin. In addition to cyclobenzaprine, medications included cetirizine, desogestrel\u2013ethinyl estradiol, and a multivitamin. She had no known allergies. She lived in New England with her husband and had recently started a new job as an office manager. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. One sister had autoimmune thyroiditis, and another had alopecia areata.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/91 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.7. The patient appeared anxious but was in no acute distress. Strength was assessed as normal in the arms and legs. She had mildly increased tone in the legs; no fasciculations were present. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ in the arms and 3+ in the legs, with nonsustained clonus in the ankles. An exaggerated startle response was present. Sensation was normal. On ambulation, there was reduced flexion of the knees and a wide-based gait.\nBlood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of creatine kinase was 33 U per liter (reference range, 26 to 192), the C-reactive protein level 1 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 10), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 2 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Schaefer: MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1), was limited by motion artifact. No specific cord abnormality was identified. Mild degenerative changes were noted in the thoracolumbar spine, without moderate or severe narrowing of the spinal canal or neural foramina. No abnormal enhancement was seen. Possible atrophy of the posterior paraspinal musculature was detected in the lower lumbar spine. Exaggeration of the normal lumbar lordosis was noted.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Spine.\nDr. Coraini: A diagnostic test was performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 autoantibody\u2013associated stiff-person syndrome."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Ethan Borre (Medicine): A 36-year-old man was evaluated in the infectious diseases clinic of this hospital because of fevers.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 18 days before the current presentation, when he began to have a sensation of swelling in his throat. Three days later, the temporal temperature measured at home was 38.4\u00b0C. A home test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen was negative. The patient was evaluated in a local urgent care clinic, where he was told that there were white spots on his tonsils. Treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid was started for a presumptive diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. A throat culture was reportedly negative, but treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid was continued. During the next 4 days, fevers persisted. A repeat home test for SARS-CoV-2 antigen was negative. Eleven days before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician.\nIn addition to fevers, the patient reported headaches. Two weeks before the onset of symptoms, he had traveled with his wife to the southwestern United States for 1 week. During the trip, his wife had begun to have fever and sore throat; her symptoms had resolved after several days, and she did not seek medical evaluation. The patient reported that he did not have throat pain, but rather that the lower part of his neck felt swollen and that moving his neck caused discomfort. He had no dysphagia, odynophagia, rhinorrhea, or rash. His medical history included seasonal allergies.\nTwo years earlier, a routine screening test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had been negative. In addition to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid, medications included ibuprofen as needed for headaches and acetaminophen as needed for fevers. The patient had no known drug allergies. He lived in Massachusetts and worked in an office setting. He had moved to the United States from Asia 7 years before the current presentation. He drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. He occasionally smoked tobacco. His father had hypertension, and his paternal grandmother had cancer of unclear primary origin.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 127/69 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The tonsils appeared normal, without exudates or enlargement. There was mild tenderness on palpation over the anterior portion of the neck that was thought to correspond to enlarged lymph nodes in the anterior cervical region. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nA complete blood count with differential count and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was 65.8 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) antibodies was negative. Urinalysis was normal. A specimen of blood was obtained for culture. The results of chest radiography were normal. A diagnosis of viral pharyngitis was considered, but treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid for possible streptococcal pharyngitis was continued.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range, 11 Days before the Current Presentation\n\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 43.8\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 14.6\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 7320\n\nDifferential count (per pl):\nNeutrophils (per \u00b5l), 1800\u20137700, 5100\nLymphocytes (per \u00b5l), 1000\u20134800, 1430\nMonocytes (per \u00b5l), 200\u20131200, 610\nEosinophils (per \u00b5l), 0\u2013900, 130\nBasophils (per \u00b5l), 0\u2013300, 30\nImmature granulocytes (per \u00b5l), 0\u2013100, 20\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 375,000\n\nDuring the next 6 days, daily fevers and headaches continued, and fatigue developed. The patient reported his symptoms during a telephone call with his primary care physician. Blood cultures that had been obtained during the previous evaluation were without growth, and additional testing was performed. The blood level of CRP was 138.9 mg per liter, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 81 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 14). A test for Lyme disease was nonreactive. The result of an interferon-\u03b3 release assay to detect previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis was invalid because of a test control failure. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Shambo Guha Roy: Computed tomography (CT) of the neck (Figure 1), chest, and abdomen was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. A calcified lung nodule that was observed in the left lower lobe was consistent with previous granulomatous disease, and mild degenerative changes were noted in the thoracic spine. Evaluation of the thyroid gland was suboptimal owing to a streak artifact from the arms; however, a possible hypoattenuating nodule was observed in the right lobe.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Neck.\nDr. Borre: During the next 4 days, fevers continued, and the patient was referred to the infectious diseases clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the infectious diseases clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient reported that fevers were most prominent in the evening; the highest recorded temperature was 39.5\u00b0C. He had had two episodes of chills associated with fever, as well as occasional night sweats. He had no pets or animal exposures. He did not consume unpasteurized cheeses or uncooked meats. He was sexually active with his wife. A dental extraction had been performed 2 months before the onset of fevers. He had no known exposures to persons with tuberculosis.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 144/98 mm Hg, the pulse 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was noted to cough occasionally during the examination but was breathing comfortably with normal lung sounds. The oropharynx appeared normal, without tonsillar exudates. There was no supraclavicular, submandibular, cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Firm, nontender thyroid tissue was palpable in the anterior portion of the neck. No rashes or skin lesions were present, including on the palms or soles. The heart was tachycardic with a regular rhythm and no murmurs.

Witkin: A 21-year-old male college student was evaluated in the cardiology clinic at this hospital, before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, because of progressive dyspnea.\nWhen the patient was in his early teens, he was evaluated for intermittent exertional dyspnea and received a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma. Montelukast and an albuterol inhaler were prescribed for use as needed; however, he had not used these medications in the 2 years before the current presentation.\nSeveral months before the current presentation, the patient noticed increased dyspnea, which occurred when he was playing sports such as volleyball or walking on campus, specifically when walking at an incline or while carrying parcels. Friends had commented on his inability to \u201ckeep up\u201d during games and while walking.\nSix days before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated for dyspnea by his primary care physician at a hospital affiliated with this hospital. The heart rate was 71 beats per minute and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG), transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and chest radiograph were obtained.\nDr. David M. Dudzinski: An ECG (Figure 1A) showed right bundle-branch block and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. A TTE (Figure 1B and 1C) showed right ventricular enlargement with severe hypokinesia and hypertrophy (estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, 84 mm Hg), right atrial enlargement, flattening of the interventricular septum during systole and diastole, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and inferior vena cava dilatation.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCardiac Studies.\nDr. Anuradha S.

Bilateral mild, diffuse, centrilobular ground-glass nodules were noted, along with interlobular septal thickening. A 45-mm area of coarse calcification was seen in the right lobe of the liver.\nDr. Witkin: The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital with a plan for follow-up the next morning in the cardiology clinic at this hospital. At the follow-up visit, the system review was notable for snoring (reported by his roommates) and dyspnea that occurred after he ascended three flights of stairs. He had no chest pain or pressure, edema, orthopnea, dyspnea at night, light-headedness, syncope, fever, recent illness, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, change in weight, jaundice, abdominal pain or distention, change in bowel habits, nausea, anorexia, hair or nail changes, or rash.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for internal hemorrhoids with an episode of rectal bleeding, as well as a traumatic ankle sprain 3 years before the current presentation. He took no medications but had previously taken methylphenidate and atomoxetine for a learning disability characterized by inattention and difficulty with auditory processing. He took several supplements for calming and increased attention, which included the following ingredients: rhodiola extract, phosphatidylserine, melatonin, astaxanthin, and amino acids such as glutamate, glycine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, taurine, theanine, and tyrosine. He consumed protein shakes before workouts and had used creatine supplements 2 years earlier. He had received an influenza vaccine and all the routine immunizations that are required to attend school.\nThe patient was a student at a local college. During the current school year, he had been exercising at the gym three times per week, doing mostly isometric exercise and some aerobic exercise. He had never used cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, marijuana, or illicit substances. He lived with roommates, and there were no known allergic or environmental exposures in their apartment. His family history was notable for inflammatory bowel disease in his father, coronary artery disease in several paternal relatives, myocardial infarction in his maternal grandfather (when he was in his 70s), colon cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after long-term smoking in his maternal grandmother, and asthma in his maternal aunt. His two siblings were healthy.\nOn examination, the heart rate was 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg in the right arm and 122/72 mm Hg in the left arm, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was in the supine position and breathing ambient air, and the level decreased to 90% after he ascended two flights of stairs. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.6. The patient appeared to have normal development and was breathing comfortably. The sclerae were anicteric. The jugular venous pressure was 14 cm of water. A parasternal heave was detected. On auscultation, the lungs were clear, the P2 heart sound was accentuated, and a grade 3/6 early systolic murmur was present at the left sternal border. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Clubbing of the fingers and toes was present, without cyanosis.\nAn ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute, right bundle-branch block, and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. Blood levels of thyrotropin and glycated hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nAdditional tests were performed the next day. Spirometry showed normal lung volumes and a reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO; 71% of the predicted value). A bronchodilator test showed no clinically significant response to an inhaled bronchodilator. Right heart catheterization revealed a right atrial pressure of 6 mm Hg, a right ventricular pressure of 90/7 mm Hg, a pulmonary arterial pressure of 89/28 mm Hg (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 57 mm Hg), and a pulmonary arterial wedge pressure of 8 mm Hg. The central venous oxygen saturation was 67% (reference range, 60 to 70), the mixed venous oxygen saturation 71% (reference range, 65 to 75), and the arterial oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The cardiac output, measured by means of thermodilution, was 6.2 liters per minute. The pulmonary vascular resistance was approximately 8 Wood units. After the patient inhaled 30 ppm of nitric oxide, the mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 52 mm Hg and the cardiac output 6.0 liters per minute.\nA diagnosis was made.", "ground_truth_output": "Congenital absence of the main portal vein with a congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (Abernethy malformation)."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Jacquelyn M. Nestor (Medicine): A 19-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of respiratory failure.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 weeks before the current presentation, when pain developed in the right shoulder and the right flank. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital and was discharged home after testing for kidney stones and appendicitis was reportedly negative.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, dyspnea with exertion and nonproductive cough developed. Six days after the onset of dyspnea and cough, the patient departed on a vacation cruise with her family. During the 8-day trip, dyspnea and cough worsened and prevented her from participating in activities such as swimming and hiking. By the end of the cruise, she had severe dyspnea with walking, and she required the use of a wheelchair during her trip home. After returning to Massachusetts, she presented to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation.\nThe patient reported ongoing cough and progressively worsening dyspnea but no chest pain or hemoptysis. The temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 132 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/47 mm Hg, the respiratory rate more than 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while she was breathing ambient air. She appeared ill and had increased work of breathing. A murmur was heard on cardiac examination; other details of the examination are not available. An electrocardiogram (ECG) reportedly showed sinus tachycardia and lateral and precordial T-wave inversions. Urinalysis results and blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; the blood level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 24,913 pg per milliliter (reference range, 5 to 125).

Point-of-care ultrasonography reportedly revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, marked aortic regurgitation, and a possible aortic-root abscess. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula. Treatment with intravenous furosemide, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin was started. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit of this hospital.\nOn arrival at the cardiac intensive care unit, the patient received bilevel positive airway pressure. A family member accompanying the patient provided additional history. The patient had had intermittent back pain beginning 6 months before the current presentation. Two months before the current presentation, she had had asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Five weeks before the current presentation, she had had a dental cleaning. During the cruise, the patient had two episodes of diarrhea without fever or chills; the family member did not know whether other persons on the cruise had been ill. The patient had told her family that she had noticed visible pulsations in her chest during the 2 weeks before the current presentation, and the family member reported that the patient\u2019s breathing had appeared labored while she was sleeping.\nOther medical history included anxiety and anemia. The patient took supplemental iron and had no known drug allergies. She did not use alcohol, tobacco, or other substances. She lived with her family in Massachusetts and worked in child care. There was no family history of cardiac or autoimmune disease.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure 145/58 mm Hg in the right arm and 136/65 mm Hg in the left arm, the respiratory rate 48 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving bilevel positive airway pressure (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.70). The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. While the patient was sitting in an upright position, she had increased work of breathing and intermittent cough. The heart rhythm was tachycardic, with a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the base and a grade 3/4 decrescendo diastolic murmur at the base that radiated to the apex, without an S3 gallop. Carotid and subclavian bruits were present. The jugular venous pressure was 8 cm of water. There were rales and decreased breath sounds in both lungs. Brachial, ulnar, radial, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses were symmetric. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, thyrotropin, lipase, human chorionic gonadotropin, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of liver function and kidney function. A urine toxicology screening test was negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 77 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the blood level of C-reactive protein was 147.8 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Tests for SARS-CoV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative.\nDr. Eric M. Isselbacher: An ECG (Figure 1A) showed sinus tachycardia, a borderline rightward axis, poor R-wave progression in leads V1 through V4, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 1B through 1F and Videos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 34%. The aortic valve was tricuspid, without evidence of vegetation or aortic-root abscess, but there was incomplete closure of the aortic valve, which resulted in severe aortic regurgitation. The ascending thoracic aorta was dilated, measuring 44 mm in diameter, with thickened walls. The dilated left ventricle caused tethering of the mitral valve, which resulted in mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation and mild left atrial enlargement. There was a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of cardiac tamponade.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCardiac Studies.\nDr. Vinit Baliyan: CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 2) showed an irregular aortic contour with narrowing of the lumen in the vessels of the aortic arch and in the right renal artery. This imaging was performed with ECG gating, which allowed for the assessment of the aortic root. There was no evidence of a perivalvular abscess. However, circumferential wall thickening was present in the aorta at the root and in the ascending segment. In addition, there was circumferential wall thickening in partially visualized proximal vessels of the aortic arch and in the abdominal aorta. The mural thickening of the aorta showed enhancement that was suggestive of active inflammation; this enhancement was most visible in the abdominal aorta. Other findings included cardiomegaly with a markedly dilated left ventricle, alveolar pulmonary edema, a small pericardial effusion, and bilateral small pleural effusions.\nFIGURE 2\n\nCT Angiography of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.\nDr. Nestor: A diagnosis and management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Takayasu\u2019s arteritis."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Nathan C. Praschan (Psychiatry): A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.\nFour months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.\nThree months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.\nOne month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed \u201cshaking and clenching\u201d movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.\nAt least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician\u2019s hand was placed on the patient\u2019s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient\u2019s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician\u2019s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.\nOn the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient\u2019s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 111/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.\nApproximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as \u201cpretty good\u201d and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.\nThe patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.\nBlood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm.

He had dyspnea on exertion (while moving and stocking boxes and when walking home from work), with baseline exertional dyspnea that occurred after ascending two to three flights of stairs. The next day, the patient had palpitations and felt lightheaded throughout the day. The palpitations continued, and he was evaluated by his primary care physician at an outpatient primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital.\nOn a review of systems, the patient reported nausea with intermittent retching, anorexia (eating only a slice of cheese for the day), and fatigue. He stated that his right eye was \u201cout of focus,\u201d but he also noted that he had had this symptom in the past. He reported no chest pain or pressure. Although he had often had angina in the past, the patient noted that he had not had any episodes in the past 2 years and that he had had only one episode of substernal discomfort, which occurred while he was walking and had lasted 45 seconds. In addition, he had had no presyncope or loss of consciousness, ICD discharge, edema, orthopnea, paroxysms of nocturnal dyspnea, fever, known sick contacts, diarrhea, weight change, abdominal pain or bloating, dysuria, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, bleeding symptoms, or focal neurologic symptoms. He had not missed any doses of medications, and his last ICD check was 3 months before the current presentation.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for premature coronary artery disease, with a first occurrence of myocardial infarction in his third decade of life. In his fifth decade of life, he had undergone coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) and subsequent stenting of the native left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary angiography, which was performed 2 years earlier for evaluation of angina, showed that the bypass graft and stent were patent but that severe native coronary disease was present (and was unchanged from an earlier study). The patient\u2019s medical history also included ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronically reduced ejection fraction and scarring of the inferior and inferoposterior left ventricle, and ventricular tachycardia that had been treated with antiarrhythmic medication and an ICD. The ICD had been placed 3 years before the current presentation during an admission at this hospital for syncope that was followed by in-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia, which required multiple external defibrillations. Thereafter, the patient received treatment with oral amiodarone; however, device interrogation revealed intermittent ventricular tachycardia at rates of 109 to 117 beats per minute that persisted over the next 8 months, and he underwent endocardial ablation of ventricular tachycardia in the scar of the mid-inferior wall. Six months after ablation, he was readmitted to this hospital because of nausea and dizziness that were due to recurrent sustained slow ventricular tachycardia (110 beats per minute), for which he was treated with intravenous lidocaine and antitachycardia pacing.\nIn addition, the patient\u2019s medical history included bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement concurrent with CABG, which had been complicated by prosthetic valve deterioration with mixed stenosis and mitral regurgitation, and culminated in transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement 2.5 years before the current presentation. He also had a history of hypertension, pulmonary embolism (4 years before the current presentation), iron-deficiency anemia, a colonic polyp, and prolonged encephalopathy after CABG. Medications included aspirin, coumadin, furosemide, metoprolol, lisinopril, dapagliflozin, ranolazine, atorvastatin, ferrous gluconate, paroxetine, and clonazepam. Treatment with amiodarone had previously been associated with elevations in liver-function test results. At the patient\u2019s last office visit with an electrophysiologist 6 months before the current presentation, device interrogation showed no ventricular tachycardia and the heart rate was 60 beats per minute; treatment with amiodarone was discontinued.\nDr. Emily K. Zern: A transthoracic echocardiogram obtained at the same office visit with the electrophysiologist showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 31% with inferior, posterior, and apical territory dysfunction; right ventricular hypokinesis; a left-to-right interatrial shunt; trace-to-mild aortic insufficiency; a well-seated mitral valve prosthesis with no regurgitation and a mean transmitral gradient of 5 mm Hg; and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 31 mm Hg.\nDr. Malecha: At a primary care visit 5 months before the current presentation, the patient reported bloating. The heart rate was 62 beats per minute and the blood pressure 104/64 mm Hg. The thyrotropin level was normal, the N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level 646 pg per milliliter (reference value, <900), the hematocrit level 40.9% (reference range, 41.0 to 53.0), and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level 74 mg per deciliter (1.92 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 129 mg per deciliter [1.29 to 3.34 mmol per liter]).\nThe patient had had a routine office visit with his cardiologist 18 days before the current presentation, during which the heart rate was 63 beats per minute and the blood pressure 111/69 mm Hg; the weight was 83 kg. No changes were made to his medications.\nDr. Conor D. Barrett: An electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained at the visit with the cardiologist showed atrial pacing, first-degree atrioventricular delay, right bundle-branch block, and evidence of old inferior, apical, and posterior myocardial infarctions (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Electrocardiogram.\nDr. Malecha: The patient was employed in multiple service jobs. He did not drink alcohol or use tobacco or other substances. He lived with several roommates on the fourth floor of an apartment building in an urban area and climbed stairs daily. His family history was notable for coronary artery disease in his father and stroke in his father, mother, and maternal grandmother.\nAt the current presentation, the temporal temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute and regular, the blood pressure 84/59 mm Hg while the patient was sitting and 99/67 mm Hg while he was in the supine position, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83 kg. The patient appeared diaphoretic and clammy, and the skin was warm to the touch. He was alert, oriented, and lucid. The previous sternotomy and ICD sites were intact. There was no heart murmur; however, a possible S3 heart sound and minimal basilar rales were observed. The jugular venous pulse was difficult to visualize. A healed appendectomy scar was present, but the abdomen was nontender, the liver was nonpulsatile, and there was no fluid wave. The legs were warm with mild, symmetric pedal edema.\nLaboratory test results were obtained 2 weeks before the current presentation. The sodium level was 139 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145), the potassium level 4.1 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.0), the creatinine level 0.91 mg per deciliter (80.44 \u03bcg per liter; reference range, 0.80 to 1.30 mg per deciliter [70.72 to 114.92 \u03bcg per liter]), the hematocrit 44.0%, the NT-proBNP 669 pg per milliliter, and the international normalized ratio (INR) 2.9 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1).\nDiagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Postmyocardial infarction (scar-related) reentrant ventricular tachycardia."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Lena G. Liu (Neurology): A 58-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of progressively worsening confusion and evolving changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 16 months before the current presentation, when confusion and expressive and auditory aphasia developed. She was evaluated at another hospital. The findings of computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck were reportedly normal. MRI of the head reportedly showed signal hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed elevated levels of glucose and protein with a normal cell count; nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus DNA was negative. Blood and CSF paraneoplastic autoantibody and autoimmune encephalopathy panels were unrevealing. The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Screening tests for syphilis and antinuclear antibodies were negative. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized slowing, with no epileptiform discharges. A diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis was considered, and treatment included intravenous glucocorticoids for 5 days, followed by treatment with daily oral prednisone. Expressive aphasia resolved and confusion abated, but auditory aphasia persisted.\nCT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a mass measuring 5 cm in diameter in the pelvis that was composed of fat, soft tissue, and calcifications. Laparotomy was performed, and pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with a mature cystic teratoma. The patient was discharged home after a 3-week hospitalization, with a plan to taper the dose of oral prednisone after discharge.\nOne week after the patient\u2019s discharge from the other hospital, after the dose of prednisone had been decreased, malaise developed and confusion recurred. The patient was readmitted to the other hospital. MRI of the head reportedly showed a decrease in the left temporal lobe hyperintensities relative to the previous imaging study. The dose of prednisone was increased, confusion again abated, and the patient was discharged home. The dose of glucocorticoids was gradually tapered.\nSix months before the current presentation, confusion recurred, and the patient was readmitted to the other hospital. Imaging studies were performed.\nDr. Otto Rapalino: MRI of the head reportedly showed progression of the signal hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe on T2-weighted FLAIR images.\nDr. Liu: A diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis was again considered. Treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids was reinitiated, which resulted in some reduction in confusion. The patient was discharged home with instructions to continue oral prednisone therapy, with a plan to again gradually taper the dose.\nThree months before the current presentation, confusion recurred. The patient was again admitted to the other hospital, and imaging studies were repeated.\nDr. Rapalino: MRI of the head reportedly showed progression of the hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe and new signal hyperintensities in the right temporal and left occipital lobes.\nDr. Liu: Treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab was initiated. The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility, with a plan for weekly rituximab infusions for 5 weeks and a 6-week tapering course of daily oral prednisone therapy. Confusion resolved and did not recur.\nDr. Rapalino: Three weeks before the current presentation, MRI of the head, which was performed to evaluate the response to immunosuppressive medications, reportedly showed hyperintensity in both temporal lobes, with extension to the anterior aspects of the parietal lobes, on T2-weighted FLAIR images. Enhancement involving the subinsular regions was present, along with restricted diffusion in the insular cortexes. Positron-emission tomography (PET)\u2013CT of the skull base to the midthighs reportedly showed no abnormalities.\nDr. Liu: Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by her neurologist in the clinic, who recommended admission to the hospital for additional treatment owing to the progressively worsening findings on head imaging. One week before the current presentation, she was admitted to the other hospital. Treatment included daily intravenous immunoglobulin for 5 days and mycophenolate mofetil. On the third hospital day, she fell and struck her forehead while walking to the bathroom. On the sixth hospital day, she was transferred to this hospital to potentially undergo a brain biopsy.\nOn arrival at this hospital, the patient reported pain on her forehead where she had struck her head during her fall. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sensorineural hearing loss (which had been diagnosed when she was 45 years of age), and depression. The results of a routine screening colonoscopy that had been performed 4 years before the current presentation had been normal. In additional to mycophenolate mofetil and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, medications included ascorbic acid, cholecalciferol, glipizide, magnesium oxide, metoprolol, omeprazole, sertraline, and thiamine. Treatment with metformin had been stopped at the other hospital because the blood level of lactate had been 12.4 mmol per liter (112 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18 mg per deciliter]) on presentation. There were no known drug allergies. She had worked in health care until the onset of neurologic symptoms 16 months earlier.
