    "user_input": "Dr. Diana L. Stern (Psychiatry): A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of depression\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "recurrent falls\\, and difficulty caring for herself. Four years before the current admission\\, the patient received a diagnosis of depression that was precipitated by psychosocial stressors. She was treated with bupropion\\, citalopram\\, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The depression was well controlled until 1 year before the current admission\\, when she began to have anhedonia\\, decreased energy\\, sadness\\, and poor concentration. She resumed cognitive behavioral therapy\\, but her symptoms worsened during the next 4 months\\, and she had suicidal ideation. The dose of bupropion was increased\\, and treatment with trazodone was started. Fourteen weeks before the current admission\\, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident that was attributed to her falling asleep while driving. After the accident\\, she reported increased sadness\\, low energy\\, and inability to perform her usual activities. One week later\\, she fell and struck her head\\, and she was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that\\, before her fall\\, she had been feeling unsteady because of weakness in the left leg. A physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed hypodensities involving the subcortical and periventricular white matter\\, findings consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital and was discharged home. During the next week\\, the patient had balance difficulties and began using a walker. When she was evaluated in the neurology clinic\\, she reported imbalance and occasional nausea. On examination\\, she had a depressed affect. Strength was assessed as 5\u2212/5 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric at the biceps\\, triceps\\, and patellar tendons and were absent at the ankles\\, with downgoing toes. The gait was wide-based and unsteady\\, with mild dragging of the left leg. A diagnosis of postconcussive syndrome was considered\\, and treatment with ondansetron was started for nausea. Additional tests were performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed increased signal intensity in the pons and in a periventricular distribution on T2-weighted imaging\\, without associated contrast enhancement. There was a region of decreased signal intensity in the right corona radiata on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Results of electroencephalography were normal\\, as were results of electromyography and nerve-conduction studies of the left leg. Physical therapy was recommended\\, and repeat MRI was planned for 6 weeks later. Over the next 6-week period\\, during sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy\\, the patient was noted to be less talkative\\, with slow processing\\, impaired recall\\, and mild inattention. Repeat MRI with angiography performed 6 weeks after the first study revealed patchy hyperintensity involving the centrum semiovale\\, corona radiata\\, internal capsule\\, and corticospinal tract bilaterally on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging\\, without contrast enhancement; the cerebral vasculature was normal. The patient had recurrent falls without loss of consciousness and began using a wheelchair. She reported worsening sadness\\, anxiety\\, and anhedonia\\, and treatment with buspirone was started. On evaluation in the neurology clinic 6 weeks before the current admission\\, testing of leg strength yielded inconsistent results\\, but strength in both legs was assessed as 5\u2212/5 with maximum effort. Dragging of the left leg was also noted to be inconsistent. There were concerns that her depression might be contributing to her neurologic changes\\, and further follow-up with the psychiatric service was recommended. Five weeks before the current admission\\, the patient\u2019s husband brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for an evaluation of worsening memory impairment\\, poor self-care\\, and frequent falls. The patient had stopped participating in physical therapy and was spending most of the day in bed. She reported that she had lost 14 kg during the previous 4 months. Other medical history included hypertension\\, diabetes\\, and osteoarthritis of the knees. There was a history of postpartum depression 27 years earlier that had lasted for several months. Medications included amlodipine\\, buspirone\\, bupropion\\, cholecalciferol\\, citalopram\\, metformin\\, and trazodone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband in a suburb of Boston and worked as a teacher. She was a lifelong nonsmoker\\, drank alcohol only occasionally\\, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of anxiety and depression in her seventh decade of life. Her sister had a history of stroke. On examination\\, the patient appeared tired and disheveled\\, with psychomotor retardation. Strength in both legs was assessed as 5/5. She had a monoplegic gait\\, with buckling of the left leg\\, when walking down a hallway\\, but she had a normal gait when walking on a treadmill. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 25\\, indicating mild cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30\\, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The complete blood count\\, results of liver-function and kidney-function tests\\, and blood levels of cobalamin\\, thyrotropin\\, and electrolytes were normal. Screening for syphilis\\, Lyme disease\\, and the human immunodeficiency virus was negative\\, as was urine toxicologic screening. After an evaluation by a neurology consultant\\, the patient was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit. While the patient was in the hospital\\, the dose of citalopram was tapered\\, and treatment with desvenlafaxine and amphetamine\u2013dextroamphetamine was started; her levels of attention and wakefulness increased. She participated in group psychotherapy\\, cognitive behavioral therapy\\, and occupational and physical therapy. She continued to have variable weakness in the left leg and had three witnessed falls\\, during which she reportedly had fatigue and lowered herself to the ground. On hospital day 11\\, the patient reported being unable to use her left arm because of weakness. Although her left arm rested across her chest for most of the day\\, she was observed holding her husband\u2019s hand with her left hand when saying goodbye. On evaluation by a neurology consultant\\, strength in the left arm was assessed as 5/5. The working diagnosis was functional neurologic disorder. On hospital day 12\\, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center. At the rehabilitation center\\, the patient received physical\\, occupational\\, and speech therapy\\, as well as medications to treat depression. During the first week\\, she made progress toward independence in bathing\\, toileting\\, and grooming but had limited attention\\, memory\\, and problem solving. During the second week\\, she became more withdrawn. There was a paucity of speech with hypophonia\\, decreased attention\\, and less eye contact with visitors who sat on her left side than with visitors who sat on her right side. During the third week\\, the patient stopped answering questions and following commands. She was evaluated again in the emergency department of this hospital. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 141/90 mm Hg\\, the pulse 98 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was withdrawn and minimally interactive. She was able to state her name but not the date or location. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side and did not track the examiner\u2019s finger past the midline to the left. There was flattening of the left nasolabial fold. The left arm was hypertonic and held in flexion; there was no spontaneous movement of the left arm or leg\\, and she declined to participate in a strength examination. She did not withdraw the left arm in response to nail-bed pressure; she withdrew the left foot with antigravity movement in response to tactile stimulation. The white-cell count was 12\\,940 per microliter (reference range\\, 4500 to 11\\,000)\\, with a normal differential count. The remainder of the complete blood count was normal\\, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes. A diagnostic test was performed.,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma."

    "user_input": "Dr. Elliott Winford (Medicine): An 86-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of shortness of breath. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 months before the current admission\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "when he began to have shortness of breath that occurred intermittently during his daily walk of 1 to 2 miles. Ten weeks before the current admission\\, posterior lumbar decompression was performed for the treatment of spinal stenosis. The patient healed from the surgery; however\\, as his mobility increased\\, he noticed that shortness of breath occurred more frequently. During the 7 weeks after the surgery\\, shortness of breath occurred with decreasing levels of exertion. Three weeks before the current admission\\, the patient\u2019s symptoms worsened such that he was unable to walk across a room\\, and he sought evaluation in the primary care clinic of another hospital. The d-dimer level was 3220 ng per milliliter (reference value\\, <500)\\, and he was instructed to present to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation in the emergency department\\, the patient described shortness of breath that was worse with exertion or lying down. He also noted mild swelling in the right leg. There was no fever\\, cough\\, or chest discomfort. The temporal temperature was 35.8\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 156/74 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 81 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued. The lungs were clear on auscultation; there was a systolic murmur. Trace edema was present in the right leg. The high-sensitivity troponin level was 24 ng per liter (reference range\\, 0 to 14)\\, and the N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level was 1105 pg per milliliter (reference range\\, 0 to 1800).

The right atrium and right ventricle were dilated. Dr. Ada C. Stefanescu Schmidt: Myocardial perfusion imaging\\, performed after the administration of intravenous regadenoson\\, revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 75%. There was no evidence of ischemia or infarction. Dr. Winford: The patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up in the primary care clinic. During the 2 weeks after hospital discharge\\, shortness of breath persisted. On the day of the current admission\\, the patient was unable to walk even a few steps because of his shortness of breath. He returned to the primary care clinic of the other hospital for evaluation. The oxygen saturation was 78% while he was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula\\, and he was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported that the shortness of breath had worsened such that he used hiking poles to walk to the bathroom and sometimes used a wheelchair. The review of systems was notable for weight loss of 11 kg during the past 3 months\\, intermittent dizziness\\, cough that was worse when he was lying down\\, and diarrhea. The patient had a history of hypertension\\, hyperlipidemia\\, obstructive sleep apnea\\, gastroesophageal reflux disease\\, depression\\, migraines\\, spinal stenosis\\, and osteoarthritis. Medications included omeprazole\\, sertraline\\, cholecalciferol\\, and a fluticasone inhaler. He took oxycodone as needed for musculoskeletal pain\\, and he used an albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was retired and lived in a suburban area of coastal New England with his wife and two dogs. He drank one glass of wine weekly and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His father had died of stroke and his mother of heart disease. On examination\\, the blood pressure was 150/73 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 75 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.7. The patient appeared tired\\, and there were telangiectasias on his cheeks. He had dyspnea during the conversation and needed to take short breaks between sentences. He had an elevated jugular venous pressure with a prominent c-v wave; Kussmaul\u2019s sign was absent. Crackles were heard at both lung bases\\, and there was no wheezing. There was a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur\\, which was heard best at the left lower sternal border\\, as well as a soft diastolic murmur. The abdomen was nontender on palpation\\, and the liver was pulsatile. There was 1+ edema in both legs. The NT-proBNP level was 1788 pg per milliliter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Stefanescu Schmidt: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a right bundle-branch block. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) (Figure 1; and Videos 1\\, 2\\, and 3\\, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 68%. The right ventricle was dilated\\, and the interventricular septum was flattened; these findings are consistent with right ventricular volume overload. The tricuspid valve\\, particularly the septal leaflet\\, was thickened and retracted and had restricted motion. There was resultant severe tricuspid regurgitation with a large coaptation gap; the jet was directed predominantly toward the atrial septum. The pulmonic valve was thickened\\, with at least moderate pulmonic regurgitation. The mitral and aortic valves were mildly thickened\\, without clinically significant stenosis or regurgitation. The right atrium was dilated\\, and there was a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with right-to-left shunting on color Doppler imaging. The right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated to be 30 mm Hg. FIGURE 1  Transthoracic Echocardiogram. Dr. Winford: Intravenous furosemide was administered. The patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.,Carcinoid heart disease due to a metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid tumor) associated with carcinoid syndrome."

A chest radiograph reportedly showed a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Intravenous heparin was administered. Four hours later\\, computed tomography (CT) of the chest\\, performed according to a pulmonary embolism protocol\\, reportedly ruled out pulmonary embolism; it also revealed a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with an attenuation level of 34 to 50 Hounsfield units\\, a mildly dilated ascending aorta (at a diameter of 37 mm; normal diameter\\, <36 mm on the basis of the patient\u2019s sex and body-surface area)\\, and a pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe that measured 4 mm in diameter. Intravenous heparin was stopped\\, and protamine sulfate was administered. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of a second hospital 3 hours later. On arrival at the second hospital\\, the temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 101 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 108/75 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. Pulsus paradoxus measured 16 mm Hg. The jugular venous pressure was 12 cm of water. Auscultation revealed tachycardia and a pericardial friction rub. The remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the level of troponin were normal. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia and right-axis deviation\\, with minor nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Dr. Daniela R. Crousillat: A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a small-to-moderate circumferential pericardial effusion primarily abutting the right atrium and right ventricle with right atrial inversion and intermittent diastolic inversion of the right ventricle (Figure 1A). There was increased respiratory variation in the mitral inflow velocities and a dilated inferior vena cava with reduced respirophasic collapse; both these features were suggestive of the presence of physiologic characteristics of early tamponade (Figure 1B and Video 1). Colchicine and ibuprofen were administered\\, and the patient was admitted to the second hospital. FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies Obtained before This Admission. Dr. Patel: The next morning\\, pericardiocentesis was performed under fluoroscopic guidance with the use of a subxiphoid approach\\, and 200 ml of bloody fluid was drained; the intrapericardial pressure decreased from 12 mm Hg to 4 mm Hg. Analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed 4\\,700\\,000 erythrocytes per microliter and 12\\,010 nucleated cells per microliter\\, of which 78% were neutrophils\\, 13% monocytes\\, 8% lymphocytes\\, and 1% eosinophils. Gram\u2019s staining revealed neutrophils and no organisms. The pericardial fluid albumin level was 3.0 g per deciliter\\, the total protein level 4.7 g per deciliter\\, the lactate dehydrogenase level 614 U per liter\\, the glucose level 71 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter)\\, and the amylase level 31 U per liter. Dr. Vinit Baliyan: On the second hospital day\\, a CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest showed a reduction in hemopericardium\\, and a pericardial drain was visible; there was no aortic dissection. There was an atrial septal occluder device in place that appeared to be in an appropriate position. The device appeared to be relatively large and abutted the aortic root anteriorly (Figure 1C). However\\, there was no evidence of erosion of the device into the aortic wall (known as device erosion) or pseudoaneurysm formation (Figure 1D). Dr. Patel: On the third hospital day\\, no pericardial effusion was detected on TTE. Cytologic analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed reactive mesothelial cells\\, neutrophils\\, histiocytes\\, and eosinophils\\, with no malignant cells. The patient was discharged home with prescriptions for colchicine and ibuprofen. Ten days after discharge from the second hospital\\, the patient had a follow-up visit with her cardiologist and reported that the chest pain and dyspnea had resolved. The heart rate was 94 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 159/88 mm Hg\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the examination was normal. The antinuclear antibody titer was 1:160\\, with a homogeneous pattern\\, and a test for rheumatoid factor was negative. CT of the chest\\, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed small-volume pericardial effusion\\, mild bronchial wall thickening\\, and a 4-mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe. Colchicine treatment was stopped. Six weeks before the current admission\\, the patient called her primary care physician to report recurrent back pain and dyspnea that she noted were similar to her previous presentation; treatment with colchicine was resumed. During the next 12 days\\, sinus pressure\\, myalgias\\, nasal congestion\\, and cough productive of green sputum developed\\, and she was seen by her primary care physician. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 112 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg\\, and the oxygen saturation 94% while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. A screening test for respiratory viruses was negative. A chest radiograph reportedly showed clear lungs. Doxycycline was prescribed. Four days before the current admission\\, the patient was evaluated by her cardiologist at this hospital and reported ongoing cough and dyspnea. The heart rate was 87 beats per minute\\, and the blood pressure was 138/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was normal. Dr. Crousillat: A TTE showed recurrence of a moderate pericardial effusion\\, measuring up to 14 mm in end diastole\\, that was adjacent to the right ventricular free wall. There was evidence of right ventricular diastolic inversion that was suggestive of the physiologic characteristics of tamponade (Figure 2A and 2B). The patient was admitted to the cardiology floor of this hospital. FIGURE 2  Echocardiograms Obtained on This Admission. Dr. Patel: On evaluation\\, the patient reported that she had had episodes of dyspnea and cough with sputum production and a decrease in exercise tolerance in the weeks before this admission. She had no known sick contacts. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for postoperative pulmonary embolism\\, hypertension\\, dyslipidemia\\, recurrent episodes of syncope with cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses on tilt testing\\, asthma\\, obstructive sleep apnea (for which she used a continuous positive airway pressure device)\\, obesity\\, tubular adenomas (colonic polyps)\\, hepatic steatosis\\, hiatal hernia\\, osteopenia\\, and cataracts. She also had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; on previous pulmonary-function testing\\, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 0.92 liters (39% of the predicted value)\\, and the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity was 47%. Five and a half years before the current admission\\, the patient had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and abdominoplasty that had resulted in postoperative hemorrhage; she had lost 44 kg of weight after the sleeve gastrectomy. Fourteen years before this admission\\, the patient had undergone percutaneous transcatheter closure of a fenestrated atrial septal defect (ASD) with an interatrial septal aneurysm and a right-to-left shunt that was possibly related to recurrent transient ischemic attacks; the procedure had been performed with a 30-mm Amplatzer septal occluder device. She had had mammography and cervical cancer screening within the 16 months before this admission. Medications included colchicine\\, apixaban\\, losartan\\, theophylline\\, calcium\\, vitamin D\\, vitamin B12\\, a multivitamin\\, and inhaled tiotropium and mometasone\u2013formoterol\\, as well as furosemide and albuterol as needed. Topiramate had caused paresthesia. The patient lived in Massachusetts with her husband and was a business owner. She had a 40-pack-year history of cigarette smoking and had quit smoking 10 years earlier; she did not drink alcohol or use other substances. Her family history was notable for coronary artery disease in her mother and father\\, stroke in her maternal grandmother and paternal grandfather\\, and seizure in a nephew. The temporal temperature was 36.9\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 120 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 126/81 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Pulsus paradoxus measured 10 mm Hg. The height was 163 cm and the weight 67 kg; the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.2. On examination\\, the jugular venous pressure was 10 cm of water. Auscultation revealed tachycardia\\, with no murmur or rub. The remainder of the examination was normal. The prothrombin time\\, international normalized ratio\\, and blood levels of electrolytes were normal\\, as were the results of tests of liver and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An ECG showed irregular tachycardia of uncertain underlying rhythm\\, low voltage in the limb leads\\, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes\\, and a rightward axis. Diagnostic tests were performed\\, and management decisions were made.,Amplatzer septal occluder device erosion."

CT of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a left adrenal nodule\\, measuring 1.2 cm in diameter. FIGURE 2  Imaging Studies. Dr. Memel: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Intravenous fluid and oral fluconazole were administered. Biopsies of skin lesions on the left elbow and left side of the forehead were performed. During the next 5 days\\, the fatigue\\, arthralgias\\, skin lesions\\, and mouth pain continued\\, and daily fevers with temperatures of up to 38.8\u00b0C were recorded. The mouth lesion did not abate with the use of fluconazole\\, which was being administered for presumptive oral candidiasis\\, and the agent was discontinued. Dr. Samantha N. Champion: Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen of the forehead lesion revealed vacuolar interface dermatitis with hyperkeratosis\\, dyskeratosis\\, pigment incontinence\\, and sparse perivascular chronic inflammation. Similar findings were observed on histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen of the elbow lesion. Dr. Memel: Cough developed\\, and pain in the left shoulder increased. On the fifth hospital day\\, the creatine kinase level was 906 U per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The next day\\, imaging studies of the left shoulder were obtained. Dr. Rodriguez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left shoulder\\, performed on hospital day 6\\, revealed patchy mild intramuscular edema that was most pronounced in the trapezius and deltoid\\, a finding compatible with myositis (Figure 2). There was no focal or organized fluid collection. Dr. Memel: On hospital day 10\\, biopsy of the left deltoid was performed with the patient under general anesthesia. In the 24 hours after the muscle biopsy\\, hypoxemia developed\\, and the patient received 3 liters of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of more than 93%. The next day\\, the patient received 8 liters of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies of the chest were obtained. Dr. Rodriguez: Repeat chest radiography revealed progressive patchy opacities at the lung bases. Repeat CT of the chest revealed progressive peribronchovascular and peripheral ground-glass and consolidative opacities predominantly involving the lower lobes\\, a finding consistent with organizing pneumonia (Figure 2). In addition\\, new small left and trace right pleural effusions were present. Dr. Memel: A diagnostic test was performed.,Anti\u2013melanoma differentiation\u2013associated protein 5 (anti\u2013MDA-5) dermatomyositis."

    "ground_truth_output": "rectal pain\\, and vesiculopustular rash. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 days before this admission\\, when he noticed several itchy white \u201cbumps\u201d around the anus that subsequently evolved into ulcerative lesions. The next day\\, he sought evaluation at a primary care clinic of another hospital. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\\, syphilis\\, gonorrhea\\, and chlamydia were performed. An injection of penicillin G benzathine was administered\\, and treatment with valacyclovir was started. During the next 5 days\\, the perianal ulcers did not abate\\, and the patient stopped taking valacyclovir. Painful proctitis with rectal bleeding and malodorous\\, mucopurulent discharge developed\\, along with fever\\, chills\\, drenching sweats\\, and new tender swelling in the groin. Three days before this admission\\, a new painless ulcer appeared on the penis that was similar in appearance to the perianal ulcers. Two days before this admission\\, new scattered vesicular lesions appeared on the arms and legs\\, and the patient presented to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital for evaluation. Additional history was obtained from the patient. Fourteen years before this evaluation\\, sore throat and upper body rash developed; he received a diagnosis of secondary syphilis and was treated with penicillin G benzathine. He also had a history of recurrent oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection\\, for which he was treated intermittently with valacyclovir. He took daily oral emtricitabine and tenofovir for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a suburban area of Massachusetts with two roommates and a cat. Two weeks before this evaluation\\, he had traveled to an urban area of southeastern Canada. During this trip\\, he had had sex with male partners without the use of barrier protection. There was no other recent travel. The patient did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he drank alcohol rarely. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 130/86 mm Hg\\, the pulse 75 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.9. There were six tender perianal ulcers\\, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter\\, with raised\\, firm margins. There was also one ulcer on the dorsum of the penile shaft\\, measuring 7 mm in diameter\\, with raised borders (Figure 1). Painful bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy was present. The perianal skin was weeping\\, and there was proctitis with severe tenderness that precluded digital rectal examination. In addition\\, there were approximately 12 papulovesicular lesions scattered across the chest\\, back\\, arms\\, and legs. The lesions measured 2 mm in diameter\\, were filled with clear fluid\\, and had surrounding erythema (Figure 2A and 2B). FIGURE 1  Photographs of Perianal and Penile Ulcers from 2 Days before Admission. FIGURE 2  Photographs of the Rash. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal\\, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. A blood test for treponemal antibodies was positive; a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was reactive at a dilution of 1:1. A blood test for HIV was nonreactive\\, and tests of urine and rectal specimens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acids were negative. A test of a specimen obtained from a perianal ulcer for HSV nucleic acids was performed\\, and a blood sample was obtained for bacterial culture. An injection of ceftriaxone was administered\\, and treatment with valacyclovir and doxycycline was started. During the next 2 days\\, the ulcers did not abate and the rectal pain worsened\\, such that the patient was not able to sit\\, sleep\\, or have bowel movements. Additional skin lesions appeared. The patient returned to the infectious disease clinic for evaluation. Anoscopy revealed intense rectal and anal inflammation with shallow ulcerations and purulent exudate\\, findings consistent with proctitis (Figure 3). The patient was admitted to this hospital. FIGURE 3  Photograph from Anoscopic Examination. On examination\\, the patient appeared uncomfortable because of rectal pain. Skin lesions that had become pustular with an erythematous base were scattered across the scalp\\, chest\\, back\\, legs\\, and arms\\, including one on the palm (Figure 2C). There were no lesions in the mouth. Multiple tender\\, enlarged inguinal lymph nodes\\, measuring more than 1 cm in diameter\\, were present. The perianal and penile ulcers were tender and had heaped margins around a central dry base. The complete blood count and the white-cell differential count were normal. Swabs from a perianal ulcer and a chest skin lesion were obtained for bacterial culture. Treatment with intravenous acyclovir was started\\, and doxycycline was continued; stool softeners and hydromorphone were administered. A blood test for HIV type 1 RNA was performed. A diagnostic test was performed.,Infection with monkeypox virus\\, West African clade."

When the patient was in his early teens\\, he was evaluated for intermittent exertional dyspnea and received a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma. Montelukast and an albuterol inhaler were prescribed for use as needed; however\\, he had not used these medications in the 2 years before the current presentation. Several months before the current presentation\\, the patient noticed increased dyspnea\\, which occurred when he was playing sports such as volleyball or walking on campus\\, specifically when walking at an incline or while carrying parcels. Friends had commented on his inability to \u201ckeep up\u201d during games and while walking. Six days before the current presentation\\, the patient was evaluated for dyspnea by his primary care physician at a hospital affiliated with this hospital. The heart rate was 71 beats per minute and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG)\\, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)\\, and chest radiograph were obtained. Dr. David M. Dudzinski: An ECG (Figure 1A) showed right bundle-branch block and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. A TTE (Figure 1B and 1C) showed right ventricular enlargement with severe hypokinesia and hypertrophy (estimated right ventricular systolic pressure\\, 84 mm Hg)\\, right atrial enlargement\\, flattening of the interventricular septum during systole and diastole\\, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation\\, and inferior vena cava dilatation. FIGURE 1  Cardiac Studies. Dr. Anuradha S. Shenoy-Bhangle: A frontal chest radiograph (Figure 2A) showed enlarged hila and an irregular calcification over the right upper quadrant. FIGURE 2  Imaging Studies of the Chest. Dr. Witkin: The patient was referred to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination\\, the heart rate was 77 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 130/82 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. The white-cell differential count and blood levels of calcium\\, amylase\\, lipase\\, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Echocardiography performed after the administration of agitated saline (a \u201cbubble study\u201d) did not reveal an atrial septal defect\\, but a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting was identified.

However\\, the main pulmonary artery was dilated (diameter\\, 39 mm; normal value\\, 29 in men and 27 in women)\\, as were segmental pulmonary artery branches. The right ventricle was enlarged. Bilateral mild\\, diffuse\\, centrilobular ground-glass nodules were noted\\, along with interlobular septal thickening. A 45-mm area of coarse calcification was seen in the right lobe of the liver. Dr. Witkin: The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital with a plan for follow-up the next morning in the cardiology clinic at this hospital. At the follow-up visit\\, the system review was notable for snoring (reported by his roommates) and dyspnea that occurred after he ascended three flights of stairs. He had no chest pain or pressure\\, edema\\, orthopnea\\, dyspnea at night\\, light-headedness\\, syncope\\, fever\\, recent illness\\, cough\\, wheezing\\, hemoptysis\\, change in weight\\, jaundice\\, abdominal pain or distention\\, change in bowel habits\\, nausea\\, anorexia\\, hair or nail changes\\, or rash. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for internal hemorrhoids with an episode of rectal bleeding\\, as well as a traumatic ankle sprain 3 years before the current presentation. He took no medications but had previously taken methylphenidate and atomoxetine for a learning disability characterized by inattention and difficulty with auditory processing. He took several supplements for calming and increased attention\\, which included the following ingredients: rhodiola extract\\, phosphatidylserine\\, melatonin\\, astaxanthin\\, and amino acids such as glutamate\\, glycine\\, 5-hydroxytryptophan\\, taurine\\, theanine\\, and tyrosine. He consumed protein shakes before workouts and had used creatine supplements 2 years earlier. He had received an influenza vaccine and all the routine immunizations that are required to attend school. The patient was a student at a local college. During the current school year\\, he had been exercising at the gym three times per week\\, doing mostly isometric exercise and some aerobic exercise. He had never used cigarettes\\, electronic cigarettes\\, marijuana\\, or illicit substances. He lived with roommates\\, and there were no known allergic or environmental exposures in their apartment. His family history was notable for inflammatory bowel disease in his father\\, coronary artery disease in several paternal relatives\\, myocardial infarction in his maternal grandfather (when he was in his 70s)\\, colon cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after long-term smoking in his maternal grandmother\\, and asthma in his maternal aunt. His two siblings were healthy. On examination\\, the heart rate was 81 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg in the right arm and 122/72 mm Hg in the left arm\\, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was in the supine position and breathing ambient air\\, and the level decreased to 90% after he ascended two flights of stairs. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.6. The patient appeared to have normal development and was breathing comfortably. The sclerae were anicteric. The jugular venous pressure was 14 cm of water. A parasternal heave was detected. On auscultation\\, the lungs were clear\\, the P2 heart sound was accentuated\\, and a grade 3/6 early systolic murmur was present at the left sternal border. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Clubbing of the fingers and toes was present\\, without cyanosis. An ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute\\, right bundle-branch block\\, and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. Blood levels of thyrotropin and glycated hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional tests were performed the next day. Spirometry showed normal lung volumes and a reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO; 71% of the predicted value). A bronchodilator test showed no clinically significant response to an inhaled bronchodilator. Right heart catheterization revealed a right atrial pressure of 6 mm Hg\\, a right ventricular pressure of 90/7 mm Hg\\, a pulmonary arterial pressure of 89/28 mm Hg (mean pulmonary arterial pressure\\, 57 mm Hg)\\, and a pulmonary arterial wedge pressure of 8 mm Hg. The central venous oxygen saturation was 67% (reference range\\, 60 to 70)\\, the mixed venous oxygen saturation 71% (reference range\\, 65 to 75)\\, and the arterial oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The cardiac output\\, measured by means of thermodilution\\, was 6.2 liters per minute. The pulmonary vascular resistance was approximately 8 Wood units. After the patient inhaled 30 ppm of nitric oxide\\, the mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 52 mm Hg and the cardiac output 6.0 liters per minute. A diagnosis was made.,Congenital absence of the main portal vein with a congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (Abernethy malformation)."

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a shrunken nodular cirrhotic liver contour and large-volume ascites; the gallbladder was surgically absent. Compression deformities of the lumbar spine\\, healed pubic rami fractures\\, and a left hip prosthesis were also noted. CT of the head revealed mild scattered hypodensities in the white matter\\, a finding consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. Dr. Zhou: Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone was administered. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. During the subsequent 12 days\\, lactulose and rifaximin were administered\\, and hepatic encephalopathy abated. Anemia worsened\\, and packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed\\, which reportedly revealed esophageal varices with evidence of previous band ligation and no active bleeding\\, as well as portal hypertensive gastropathy and erythematous duodenitis. Results of testing of the peritoneal fluid were not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis\\, and ceftriaxone was stopped. Treatment with furosemide and spironolactone was administered\\, and three therapeutic paracenteses were performed. The renal function worsened\\, the administration of diuretic agents was stopped\\, albumin was given intravenously\\, and treatment with midodrine and octreotide was started. On hospital day 13\\, the patient was transferred to this hospital for additional management of end-stage liver disease and acute renal injury\\, as well as evaluation for liver transplantation. On transfer to this hospital\\, the patient described nausea and increasing abdominal distention and discomfort. A review of systems was notable for headache\\, heartburn\\, and pain in the left shoulder and hip. The patient had a history of coronary artery disease\\, diabetes mellitus type 2\\, hyperlipidemia\\, obesity\\, gastroesophageal reflux disease\\, hypothyroidism\\, anxiety\\, and depression. Migraines had occurred frequently in the past but had been rare after menopause. She had previously undergone a cesarean section\\, cholecystectomy\\, arthroplasty of the left shoulder\\, and recently\\, an open reduction and internal fixation involving the left femur. Medications included lactulose\\, midodrine\\, octreotide\\, ondansetron\\, pantoprazole\\, simethicone\\, insulin\\, gabapentin\\, duloxetine\\, and levothyroxine. Oxycodone and fentanyl patches started after the recent surgery were weaned and stopped\\, and the patient took acetaminophen as needed for pain. Treatment with azithromycin\\, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole\\, and hydromorphone had caused nausea and diarrhea; metoclopramide\\, promethazine\\, and prochlorperazine had caused anxiety. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her husband and did not work because of medical disability. She did not drink alcohol\\, smoke cigarettes\\, or use illicit drugs. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 92/55 mm Hg\\, and the pulse 78 beats per minute. The patient appeared chronically ill and jaundiced and was alert and oriented. The abdomen was tensely distended\\, with a fluid wave and diffuse tenderness. She had no asterixis\\, and trace swelling was present in both legs. No rash was present. The neurologic examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with midodrine and octreotide was stopped\\, and treatment with terlipressin was started. On hospital day 2\\, the patient noted that headache\\, which had been present since admission to the other hospital\\, had increased in severity. The pain\\, which she described as \u201cthrobbing and pounding\\,\u201d was in the right frontal region and reminded her of previous migraines. On hospital day 3\\, headache persisted\\, and the pain radiated to the back of her neck\\, which was not typical of her previous migraines. Butalbital\u2013acetaminophen\u2013caffeine was given\\, and a lidocaine patch was placed at the back of the neck; however\\, the pain did not abate after these treatments. On hospital day 4\\, nausea and abdominal distention increased\\, and therapeutic paracentesis was performed. Dr. Kozak: CT of the head showed no changes from the previous imaging (Figure 1). Figure 1  Initial CT of the Head. Dr. Zhou: The administration of sumatriptan and intravenous magnesium and hydromorphone relieved the headache. However\\, on hospital day 5\\, headache worsened in severity throughout the day until the patient was tearful and rated the pain at 9 on a scale of 0 to 10\\, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She had new photophobia\\, and blurred vision developed in the right eye. Intravenous hydromorphone was administered\\, and she subsequently rated the pain at 6 out of 10. A diagnosis was made.,Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis."

    "user_input": "Dr. Cory A. Perugino: A 70-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of a recurrent left pleural effusion. Five years before this presentation\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "the patient had pain in the shoulders and proximal muscles of the arms and legs. The pain was worse in the morning and was associated with fatigue. There was no associated stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level were elevated. Prednisone was initiated for the treatment of a working diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica\\, and symptoms abated quickly. During the next year\\, attempts to discontinue prednisone led to recurrent myalgias\\, as well as elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level. Three years before this presentation\\, swelling\\, erythema\\, and pain developed in the cartilaginous portion of the left ear\\, sparing the earlobe (Figure 1). There was no reduction in these symptoms after empirical antibacterial therapy was initiated for the treatment of presumed cellulitis. The dose of prednisone was increased\\, and the symptoms involving the ear resolved; however\\, they recurred when the dose of prednisone was tapered. Biopsy of the left auricle revealed perichondrial inflammation and degenerative changes in the cartilage. The dose of prednisone was increased for a presumed diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis. The symptoms involving the ear resolved\\, and weekly therapy with methotrexate was initiated. FIGURE 1  Clinical Photographs. During the next 6 months\\, attempts to taper the prednisone dose were associated with worsening inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms\\, along with elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was as high as 89 mm per hour (reference range\\, 0 to 13) and the C-reactive protein level as high as 73.6 mg per liter (reference value\\, <8.0). Two years before this presentation\\, the patient began treatment with tocilizumab for fatigue\\, markedly elevated C-reactive protein level\\, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate\\, all of which persisted despite treatment with prednisone and methotrexate. The administration of tocilizumab allowed for the tapering of prednisone to a lower dose without causing an exacerbation of inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms. Two weeks after the patient began receiving tocilizumab therapy\\, and upon tapering of the prednisone dose\\, pain and swelling developed in the right leg; ultrasound examination revealed a distal deep-vein thrombosis in the right posterior tibial vein. Repeat ultrasonography of the leg performed 2 weeks later did not show propagation of the deep-vein thrombosis\\, and the pain and swelling resolved with the continued use of a compression stocking and elevation of the right leg. However\\, 2 months later\\, when further tapering of the prednisone dose was started\\, inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms recurred\\, and pain and swelling developed in the left leg. Ultrasound examination revealed deep-vein thromboses in the left popliteal and left calf veins and in the right femoral vein; therapy with rivaroxaban was initiated. The development of recurrent deep-vein thromboses was attributed to the underlying inflammatory disease. The dose of prednisone was increased\\, methotrexate was continued\\, and tocilizumab was replaced with infliximab therapy. During the next 6 months\\, the inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms worsened when attempts were made to taper the prednisone dose\\, and these conditions abated only when the dose of prednisone was increased. Blood tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs)\\, rheumatoid factor\\, and anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Fifteen months before this presentation\\, treatment with rituximab was initiated. However\\, after an attempt to taper the dose of prednisone\\, bilateral scleritis developed (Figure 1); the dose of prednisone was increased again\\, which resulted in resolution of the ocular pain and redness. During the next 3 months\\, attempts to taper the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent episodes of scleritis and inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms; additional rituximab treatment was not administered. One year before the current presentation\\, treatment with low-dose cyclophosphamide was initiated\\, but the use of this medication was complicated by severe neutropenia\\, which did not allow for the dose to be escalated. Nine months before this presentation\\, treatment with cyclophosphamide was stopped\\, and intravenous tocilizumab was restarted\\, given its previous efficacy in this patient. However\\, the use of tocilizumab also resulted in moderate but transient neutropenia after each infusion. Seven months before this presentation\\, pleuritic chest pain on the lower left side developed\\, along with dyspnea on exertion and a dry cough. Chest radiography revealed a moderate left pleural effusion (Figure 2A and 2B). Thoracentesis was performed\\, and 1 liter of straw-colored pleural fluid was removed; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Gram\u2019s staining of the pleural fluid revealed abundant polymorphonuclear cells but no organisms; bacterial\\, fungal\\, and mycobacterial cultures were without growth. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid revealed no malignant cells. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (performed after the pleural fluid was drained) showed a small left pleural effusion\\, a trace right pleural effusion\\, and bibasilar dependent atelectasis without consolidation\\, nodules\\, or lymphadenopathy (Figure 2C). The pleural effusions were attributed to ongoing inflammatory disease. The dose of prednisone was increased\\, and the pleurisy and dyspnea resolved. Five months before this presentation\\, tocilizumab therapy was stopped\\, and tofacitinib was initiated. One week before this presentation\\, the patient had sudden onset of back pain on the left side. Imaging studies were performed. FIGURE 2  Imaging Studies of the Chest. TABLE 1  Laboratory Data.

Breath sounds were decreased at the base of the left lung. There was no leg edema\\, joint swelling or tenderness\\, purpura\\, petechiae\\, or deficits in motor strength. The patient had a history of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cecum\\, which had been diagnosed 10 years before this presentation and had been treated with laparoscopic colectomy of the right side of the colon and with oxaliplatin therapy\\, without evidence of recurrence. Other history included peripheral neuropathy (attributed to the oxaliplatin therapy)\\, hypothyroidism\\, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Macrocytic anemia had been present for 3 years before this presentation\\, with normal blood levels of cobalamin and folate. The patient also had a history of leukopenia and neutropenia; these conditions had occurred intermittently over the course of the 10 years preceding this presentation but were most pronounced after treatment with cyclophosphamide and tocilizumab. Medications included alendronate\\, atorvastatin\\, cholecalciferol\\, folic acid\\, levothyroxine\\, methotrexate\\, omeprazole\\, prednisone\\, rivaroxaban\\, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole\\, and tofacitinib. The patient drank alcohol occasionally; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He lived in New England and was retired. There was no family history of autoimmune disease. The blood levels of electrolytes\\, glucose\\, and thyrotropin were normal\\, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed\\, and management decisions were made.,VEXAS (vacuoles\\, E1 enzyme\\, X-linked\\, autoinflammatory\\, somatic) syndrome."

    "ground_truth_output": "when myalgias developed in the upper legs. He initially attributed the pain to increased physical activity while at work in construction. When he awoke on the morning of the current presentation\\, he could not lift his legs to move in bed or to stand up. He also had weakness in the arms\\, although it was less pronounced than the weakness in the legs. He asked his family to bring him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department\\, the patient reported ongoing weakness. He had no history of trauma\\, back pain\\, or saddle anesthesia. There were no changes in sensation. He had no other relevant medical history\\, and he took no prescribed medications. He had moved to Boston from El Salvador 5 months before the current presentation. After arriving in Boston\\, the patient had begun to have increasing difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep\\, which he had attributed to stress. He had had loose stools but a normal appetite and was eating normally with no abdominal pain\\, nausea\\, or vomiting; he estimated a weight loss of approximately 5 kg since moving to Boston. In addition\\, he reported that he had had trembling in his hands for several months before the current presentation\\, which he had also attributed to stress. Four days before the current presentation\\, he began taking an herbal supplement (sold under the brand name Nervitran) that was intended to reduce stress. He had no known allergies. He drank alcohol occasionally\\, had never smoked tobacco\\, and did not use illicit drugs. There was no family history of hypertension or liver disease; a maternal aunt had had an episode of weakness\\, but the patient was not aware of a diagnosis. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 144/79 mm Hg\\, the pulse 96 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. Conjunctival injection was present in both eyes. Muscle strength was 4/5 on abduction of both shoulders and on flexion and extension of the elbows\\, wrists\\, and fingers. Muscle strength was 5/5 on knee flexion and extension and 3/5 on hip flexion\\, ankle dorsiflexion\\, and plantar flexion. Sensation to light touch and temperature was normal. Patellar reflexes were 3+. There was a low-amplitude\\, high-frequency fine tremor in the hands\\, which was more prominent in the left hand than in the right hand. The remainder of the examination was normal. The complete blood count was normal\\, as were the results of tests of coagulation. A blood toxicology screen was negative for salicylates\\, acetaminophen\\, ethanol\\, and tricyclic antidepressant medications.

    "ground_truth_output": "the patient began to have swelling of the legs\\, which initially occurred only after airplane trips. During the fifth decade of life\\, the leg swelling was present on a daily basis. Thirteen years before the current presentation\\, the patient began to have frequent bowel movements (up to four per day) with loose malodorous stools and increased flatus. He was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. On examination\\, the abdomen was soft and nontender\\, with no evidence of organomegaly. There was pitting edema in both legs. The blood level of total protein was 5.5 g per deciliter (reference range\\, 6.0 to 8.3)\\, and the blood albumin level was 3.1 g per deciliter (reference range\\, 3.3 to 5.0). Results of other liver-function tests\\, including liver enzyme levels\\, were normal. The protein level in a 24-hour urine sample was normal. The blood alpha1-antitrypsin level was 173 mg per deciliter (reference value\\, <54). Blood levels of IgG\\, IgA\\, and IgM were low. Serologic tests for anti\u2013tissue transglutaminase antibodies and anti-giardia antibodies were negative. Dr. Mark A. Anderson: Computed tomographic (CT) enterography of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material\\, revealed diffuse mural thickening and hyperenhancement of the small bowel\\, with no evidence of stricturing or obstruction (Figure 1A and 1B). In addition\\, there was trace ascites (Figure 1B). FIGURE 1  Initial Imaging Studies. Dr. Uchida: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy revealed no visible abnormalities. A random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed a focal area with more than 70 eosinophils per high-power field; a biopsy specimen of the gastric antrum showed scattered eosinophils in the lamina propria. A working diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy was made\\, although neither a 2-week course of oral prednisone nor a 6-week course of oral budesonide led to a decrease in the number of bowel movements or leg edema. No further treatment was pursued. Eleven years before the current presentation\\, the patient was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. There had been no weight loss or recurrent infections\\, but leg edema persisted. Repeat EGD revealed no visible abnormalities\\, and a random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed fewer eosinophils than the previous specimen\\, with no epithelial damage. CT enterography revealed diffuse wall thickening of the entire small bowel and trace ascites. Treatment for protein-losing enteropathy \u2014 which included limiting salt intake\\, increasing dietary protein\\, and wearing compression stockings \u2014 was recommended. During the next 10 years\\, the leg edema was stable and was occasionally treated with diuretic agents\\, which did not lead to substantial improvement. Six months before the current presentation\\, the patient began to have dyspnea on exertion. Three months before this presentation\\, abdominal distention developed. The patient initially attributed the dyspnea and abdominal distention to weight gain due to reduced physical activity during quarantine for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Six weeks before this presentation\\, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician in a video conference. On the basis of this evaluation\\, laboratory and imaging studies were obtained. The blood level of total protein was 4.5 g per deciliter (updated reference range\\, 6.4 to 8.3)\\, and the blood albumin level was 2.1 g per deciliter. The complete blood count\\, blood levels of electrolytes and glucose\\, and results of liver-function and kidney-function tests were normal. Dr. Anderson: CT of the chest\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules\\, enlarged subcarinal and upper mesenteric lymph nodes\\, and moderate-volume ascites in the upper abdomen. Dr. Uchida: Three weeks later\\, paracentesis was performed\\, and 3.1 liters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. Cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.

His wife had noticed that he appeared to be moving slowly when performing activities of daily living and that he had lost muscle mass in his arms. There was no history of abdominal surgery or trauma to the abdomen. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus\\, psoriasis\\, osteoarthritis\\, and hypogammaglobulinemia. There was no history of recurrent infections\\, asthma\\, or atopic dermatitis. Medications included aspirin\\, insulin glargine\\, and metformin. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his wife in a suburb of Boston and worked in an office. He was a lifelong nonsmoker\\, drank alcohol occasionally\\, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother had colon cancer. The physical examination was limited\\, because the evaluation was done in a video conference in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Anderson: CT of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material\\, revealed multiple new hypoenhancing lesions throughout the right and left hepatic lobes\\, diffuse small-bowel wall thickening\\, moderate-volume ascites\\, upper abdominal varices\\, and enlarged upper abdominal and pelvic nodes (Figure 1C\\, 1D\\, and 1E). The only liver lesions that were large enough for reliable percutaneous sampling were at the far cranial aspect of the hepatic dome\\, where respiratory motion and crossing the diaphragm would have made an attempt at CT-guided or ultrasonographically guided biopsy very challenging\\, if not prohibitive. CT of the chest revealed tree-in-bud and clustered nodules\\, predominantly in the dependent lower lobes\\, and right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy (Figure 1F). Dr. Uchida: Tests for hepatitis C virus antibodies and for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies\\, surface antigen\\, and core antibodies were negative. Repeat paracentesis was performed\\, and 3.2 liters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. An acid-fast stain of a concentrated specimen of ascitic fluid was negative. Cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. A fluoroscopically guided transjugular liver biopsy was also performed. The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was 2 mm Hg (normal value\\, <5); the right atrial pressure was 7 mm Hg\\, the wedged hepatic venous pressure 11 mm Hg\\, and the free hepatic venous pressure 9 mm Hg. Dr. Megan J. Fitzpatrick: Histologic examination of the liver-biopsy specimen revealed mild mixed portal inflammation and grade 1 steatosis without steatohepatitis. A trichrome stain showed mild portal tract edema but no fibrosis. Dr. Uchida: Mycobacterial cultures of the ascitic fluid were negative. A diagnostic test was performed.,High-grade B-cell lymphoma\\, not otherwise specified."

    "ground_truth_output": "when myalgias\\, cough\\, sore throat\\, nausea\\, and vomiting developed. She sought evaluation at the primary care clinic of an academic medical center affiliated with this hospital (the two hospitals are part of the same health care system). Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA\\, and the patient was instructed to quarantine at home. She lived with her father and assisted him with activities of daily living; he also received a diagnosis of Covid-19. During the following week\\, the patient\u2019s cough persisted\\, and new shortness of breath developed. Her symptoms worsened; she felt that she was unable to take care of her father. Emergency medical services were called\\, and the patient and her father were taken to the emergency department of the other hospital\\, where they were both admitted for worsening Covid-19 pneumonia. The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen\\, remdesivir\\, and dexamethasone. Treatment with remdesivir was stopped on hospital day 4 when the blood aminotransferase levels increased to three times the upper limit of the normal range. During the hospitalization\\, the patient was noted to have intermittent anxiety\\, particularly when discharge planning for her father was discussed. She and her brother declined to have their father discharged to a rehabilitation center and instead planned for him to eventually return home to quarantine with the patient. On hospital day 6\\, the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation was normal while she was breathing ambient air\\, and the blood aminotransferase levels had improved. She was discharged home with instructions to quarantine and continue taking dexamethasone. One day after discharge\\, the patient\u2019s brother spoke to her on the telephone. He thought that she seemed to be confused and unable to take care of herself\\, and he asked her to return to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation in the emergency department\\, the patient explained that she was unsure why her brother had asked her to return to the hospital\\, and she said that she wanted to go home. She also expressed that she felt anxious about being home alone after discharge and overwhelmed about needing to care for her father at home once he was discharged from the hospital. The myalgias\\, cough\\, and shortness of breath had abated; she had no fevers\\, visual or auditory hallucinations\\, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. The patient had a history of major depressive disorder\\, which had been diagnosed during the second decade of life. At the time of diagnosis\\, she had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and had received electroconvulsive therapy; thereafter\\, she had been discharged to a partial hospital program. She had been hospitalized for psychiatric symptoms twice since then\\, once for major depressive disorder and once for a mixed bipolar episode that was due to insomnia and anxious distress. The latter episode was associated with catatonic features and was treated with electroconvulsive therapy. The patient had no history of suicidal or homicidal ideation or attempts and no history of violence. She had hypertension\\, diabetes\\, obesity\\, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included dexamethasone\\, bupropion\\, fluoxetine\\, olanzapine\\, losartan\\, metformin\\, and pantoprazole. Sulfa drugs had caused angioedema\\, and lisinopril had caused cough. The patient was born in the Caribbean and had emigrated four decades earlier\\, first to southwestern Europe and then to the United States 2 years later. She lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with her father\\, who had mild dementia. She did not drink alcohol\\, smoke cigarettes\\, or use illicit substances. On examination\\, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C\\, the pulse 97 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 153/95 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented but guarded\\, with a flat affect. She appeared to be more anxious than she had been during the previous hospitalization. She paced around the room and perseverated about the care of her father. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal\\, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 11\\,490 per microliter (reference range\\, 4000 to 11\\,000)\\, with neutrophil predominance; the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Urinalysis and a radiograph of the chest were normal. Treatment with dexamethasone was stopped\\, and the patient was admitted to the hospital to facilitate discharge to a rehabilitation center for continued care. On hospital day 3\\, the patient was noted to be more withdrawn\\, and she began responding to questions with one-word answers or silence. When she was encouraged to speak more\\, she continued to perseverate about the care of her father. When she was asked to elaborate on her concerns\\, she stated\\, \u201cHe is dead. I am dead.\u201d The patient appeared disheveled\\, sullen\\, and anxious. She laid in bed motionless with her eyes open and looking forward\\, and she responded briefly to questions in a quiet voice with slowed speech. Her thoughts were perseverative and tangential. There was no evidence that she had loosening of associations\\, hallucinations\\, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. She had poor insight and judgment. Memory\\, attention\\, concentration\\, abstract reasoning\\, and fund of knowledge were normal. When her arms and legs were lifted against gravity and released\\, they fell to the bed without resistance; with encouragement\\, she was able to move them. Muscle tone was normal\\, with no rigidity or waxy flexibility. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Aaron B. Paul: Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Figure 1)\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed no evidence of an acute territorial infarct\\, intracranial mass\\, or hemorrhage. There was nonspecific moderate confluent hypoattenuation involving the supratentorial white matter. FIGURE 1  CT of the Head. Dr. Kritzer: Clonazepam was administered\\, and the dose of olanzapine was increased. Admission to an inpatient psychiatric unit was recommended. During the next week\\, while awaiting placement in an inpatient psychiatric unit\\, the patient continued to show signs of anxiety and a depressed mood. She said\\, \u201cI am dead. I do not exist. I am not real.\u201d She also believed that her father and brother\\, as well as her nurses and doctors\\, were dead. The patient was selectively mute and motionless\\, but she talked and moved with encouragement. She expressed that she felt directly responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic and asked to be thrown out of the window. She had the sensation that her bladder was gone and that she could not urinate\\, although she had been observed urinating independently. She felt that she could not eat\\, although she had been observed eating breakfast daily. On hospital day 9\\, the patient was transferred to the inpatient psychiatric unit of the other hospital. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.,Cotard\u2019s syndrome\\, catatonia\\, depression\\, and seizure after coronavirus disease 2019."

The patient was in his usual state of health until 2 months before this admission\\, when his parents noticed swelling of the left foot after a fall. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital\\, and radiography of the left foot was reportedly normal. Two weeks before this admission\\, swelling of the left foot increased. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician\\, and additional imaging of the foot was recommended. The patient was already scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (which was planned to be performed with the patient under general anesthesia) as part of a research study for patients with the Dravet syndrome.1 MRI of the left foot was performed at the same time. Dr. Teresa Victoria: MRI of the head\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed diffuse cerebral volume loss. There were incidental secretions filling the sphenoid and frontal sinuses that had heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted images and hyperintense signal intensity on T1-weighted images; mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses was also noted. MRI of the left foot\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed multifocal bone marrow edema in the midfoot and hindfoot. There was no fracture\\, dislocation\\, or joint effusion. Dr. Lerner: Treatment with amoxicillin was initiated by the patient\u2019s primary care physician to treat possible sinusitis. Seven days before this admission\\, the patient\u2019s parents noticed increased swelling and new warmth of the left foot\\, and the patient appeared uncomfortable when bearing weight on that foot.

During the next 5 days\\, his parents noticed that he was less interactive than usual. He had intermittent diaphoresis and tachycardia\\, and the frequency of seizures had increased from one every 2 to 3 days to two or three seizures daily. One day before this admission\\, the oral temperature measured at home was 38.1\u00b0C. After a telephone consultation with the patient\u2019s primary care physician\\, treatment with amoxicillin was changed to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate. The seizure frequency did not decrease\\, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. They had not observed nasal congestion\\, rhinorrhea\\, or cough. The patient had gingivitis that had recently worsened; during the 2 weeks before this admission\\, there had been new bleeding from the gums and bleeding from the nose. The patient was following a ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment for seizures; because of multiple food allergies\\, the ketogenic formula was administered through a gastrostomy tube. He had loose stools\\, which the parents attributed to tube feeding; the stools were unchanged in volume and frequency. He had had two episodes of nonbilious\\, nonbloody emesis during the week before this admission. The patient\u2019s parents also reported that 7 months before this admission\\, the patient had begun to have fever\\, vomiting\\, and increased volume and frequency of stools; coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was diagnosed\\, and the volume of the ketogenic formula was decreased by half for 4 days until vomiting resolved.

He had no known drug allergies. He lived with his father and two cats in an urban area of New England; he occasionally stayed with his mother in a rural area of New England. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 124 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 124/87 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.8. The patient appeared tired and flushed but was alert and interactive. There was low muscular bulk and tone. The gingivae were erythematous and bleeding (Figure 2)\\, and several dental caries were seen. There was no sinus tenderness or discharge. The lungs were clear on auscultation\\, and the heart sounds were normal. The abdomen was nontender\\, and the insertion site of the gastrostomy tube was not erythematous or indurated. The walking cast was removed; there was edema and bruising of the left foot (Figure 2). FIGURE 2  Clinical Photographs. The results of tests of liver function and kidney function were normal\\, as were the blood levels of electrolytes and glucose.

Stool testing for Clostridium difficile antigen and toxin was negative\\, as was a stool examination for ova and parasites. Specimens of blood and stool were sent for culture. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest revealed a patchy opacity in the right lung base. Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed diffuse bone demineralization and fractures of the second metatarsal and cuboid\\, findings that were similar to those seen on previous imaging. There was sclerosis in the proximal first and distal fourth and fifth metatarsals that was suggestive of new fractures. A crescentic osseous fragment was thought to be an avulsed fragment of bone. Dr. Lerner: A diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made\\, treatment with intravenous fluids and ampicillin\u2013sulbactam was administered\\, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 7 days\\, he had no fever\\, but tachycardia persisted. Blood cultures showed no growth\\, and stool cultures showed normal intestinal flora. The CRP level had increased to 108.1 mg per liter\\, the d-dimer level was 6953 ng per milliliter (reference range\\, 0 to 500)\\, and the hemoglobin level had decreased to 7.0 g per deciliter. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Victoria: Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed multiple new areas of cortical erosions\\, including the medial base of the first metatarsal and the medial navicular bone. MRI of the left tibia\\, fibula\\, and foot (Figure 3)\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed worsening bone edema in the left foot; foci of bone edema were also seen in the proximal tibia and fibula. Multiple fractures that had been seen on previous imaging of the left foot were noted\\, and there were intraosseous cystic hemorrhagic foci within the calcaneal\\, cuboid\\, and second metatarsal fractures.

Twenty-three years before the current presentation\\, swelling of the left hand developed after the patient sustained a human bite. The swelling was associated with mild pruritus\\, erythema\\, and warmth. The swelling was well demarcated\\, involved only the left hand\\, and resolved after 3 days without specific treatment. Twenty-two years before the current presentation\\, the patient had epigastric pain that radiated to her back\\, with associated nausea. Results of an upper gastrointestinal series\\, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen\\, hepatobiliary scintigraphy\\, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were reportedly normal. The abdominal pain resolved\\, but two similar self-limited episodes occurred during the next year. No cause for the abdominal pain was identified. During the next 3 years\\, episodes of self-limited swelling occurred once per year; one episode involved the right foot\\, one the left hand\\, and one the right hand. There were no clear triggers for the episodes\\, although they tended to occur after exposure to cold or after minor trauma\\, such as scratching. Eighteen years before the current presentation\\, episodes of swelling of the hands and feet began to occur on a monthly basis\\, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital after an episode of swelling of the left hand. A skin-biopsy specimen reportedly showed sparse superficial dermal perivascular and interstitial mixed inflammatory infiltrate and stromal edema. Treatment with prednisone was initiated. The swelling of the left hand resolved after 3 days\\, and the patient was referred to the allergy clinic of this hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency was made on the basis of low levels of C1 esterase inhibitor\\, C4\\, and C1q. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal\\, and tests for antinuclear antibodies were negative.

The patient was evaluated in the allergy clinic of the third hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The dose of danazol was increased\\, and the patient was instructed to take hydroxyzine as needed during episodes of swelling that were associated with pruritus. The swelling episodes associated with pruritus occurred with variable frequency (several times per week to once every few months) but resolved within 30 minutes after the administration of hydroxyzine. Cetirizine was substituted for hydroxyzine for acute episodes. Treatment with daily loratadine and ranitidine was initiated\\, and the episodes of swelling with pruritus decreased in frequency. Four months before the current presentation\\, swelling of the right arm developed after venipuncture. There was no associated pruritus.

Ultrasonography of the arm showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis\\, and the patient was discharged from the emergency department. The swelling resolved after 3 days. Two weeks before the current presentation\\, nausea\\, vomiting\\, and diarrhea developed. The patient attributed her symptoms to food poisoning\\, since her daughter had similar symptoms; the symptoms resolved after 3 days. One week before the current presentation\\, epigastric pain developed; the pain was burning in character\\, worsened with consumption of food\\, and abated with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient was evaluated at a fourth hospital\\, where CT of the abdomen reportedly revealed inflammation of the duodenum and jejunum. A proton-pump inhibitor was administered\\, and the abdominal pain decreased. The patient was instructed not to take NSAIDs and was discharged home. However\\, during the next week\\, abdominal pain recurred\\, along with new symptoms of poor appetite and early satiety. She presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further care.

Results of a Papanicolaou test performed 3 months before this presentation had been normal; the patient had not undergone mammography or colonoscopy. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England. She was born in Portugal and had immigrated to the United States 40 years earlier. She had not traveled recently; her last trip had been to Portugal 25 years before this admission. The patient was divorced\\, lived alone\\, and worked in a medical laboratory. She had no known exposure to chemicals or dust; a coworker at a previous office job had had an atypical infection attributed to mold in the workplace. She had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. She drank alcohol three times a week and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from colon cancer at 43 years of age. On examination\\, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 130/64 mm Hg\\, the pulse 65 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was normal. A diagnosis was made.,Langerhans-cell histiocytosis of the lung and liver."

    "ground_truth_output": "a 24-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever\\, cough\\, and shortness of breath.1 The patient had been well until 3 days before this admission\\, when malaise\\, generalized weakness\\, headache\\, and back pain developed. During the next 2 days\\, his symptoms persisted\\, and he remained at home and slept in bed for most of the day. On the day before this admission\\, he began to have fever\\, dry cough\\, and chills that caused him to shake considerably and \u201chunched him up in a knot.\u201d He was unable to get out of bed. He took aspirin at a dose of 10 grains (648 mg) every 4 hours\\, which led to decreased severity of the headache and back pain. On the day of this admission\\, the patient awoke with difficulty breathing and chest pain just below the xiphoid process. The pain increased with deep breathing and coughing. He sought evaluation at this hospital. On examination\\, the rectal temperature ranged from 39.5\u00b0C to 40.8\u00b0C\\, the heart rate from 92 to 145 beats per minute\\, and the respiratory rate from 28 to 58 breaths per minute. The patient appeared acutely ill and nervous. He was shivering despite being wrapped up in several blankets. His breathing was rapid\\, shallow\\, and labored. He had frequent paroxysms of racking cough\\, which caused excruciating pain under the lower sternum. The cough was productive of pinkish\\, thick\\, slightly purulent sputum. On palpation\\, the apical impulse of the heart was felt in the fifth intercostal space\\, 8 cm to the left of the sternum along the midclavicular line. There was no enlargement of the heart on percussion. On auscultation\\, the heart sounds were rapid and regular\\, and there was a soft systolic murmur at the apex that did not radiate. The breath sounds were diminished at the right side of the back\\, from the lower third of the scapula downward\\, but had no definitive dullness or change in character. No evidence of rales or a friction rub was noted. The throat was somewhat injected\\, and the tonsils had been surgically removed. A healed surgical scar was present on the left side of the abdomen\\, at the site of a previous hernia repair. The abdomen was not distended or tender. The skin was dry and hot to the touch. The white-cell count ranged from 3700 to 14\\,500 per microliter\\, with neutrophil predominance (79%). Blood cultures showed no growth. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: A posteroanterior chest radiograph (Figure 1) showed bilateral patchy consolidations\\, previously described as \u201cmottled dullness\\,\u201d that were most confluent in the right upper lobe and the left lower lobe. This finding is suggestive of pneumonia. There was also fullness in the left hilar region\\, which is suggestive of lymphadenopathy. The presence of a left pleural effusion cannot be ruled out. FIGURE 1  Chest Radiograph. Dr. Kathy M. Tran: Adhesive plaster was applied to the patient\u2019s chest\\, and he was admitted to this hospital. On the second hospital day\\, the shortness of breath and chest pain on inspiration continued. The cough became productive of purulent sputum and blood. W.H. Smith performed a physical examination. The patient appeared very ill and held his abdominal muscles rigid while coughing. A systolic apical bruit was detected\\, along with dullness at the right lung base. Small hyperemic papules were seen on the left palm and the right index finger. Smith noted a \u201cserious outlook\u201d for the patient. On the third hospital day\\, the sputum became much more purulent. On examination\\, increased dullness was noted on percussion of the left lower back. Increased tactile fremitus was also noted. Loud bronchial breath sounds and very few rales were heard at the left side of the back\\, from the lower third of the scapula downward. Slight dullness was present on percussion of the right lower back\\, and there were distant breath sounds and occasional medium rales. On the fourth hospital day\\, the patient continued to be very ill. He gradually grew weaker\\, and that evening\\, he died. A diagnosis was made.,Bronchopneumonia\\, most likely due to influenza."

Two years before the current evaluation\\, the patient presented to her primary care physician at this hospital with subacute exertional dyspnea\\, which had been present for more than a year but had progressively worsened during the past several months. The oxygen saturation was 91 to 94% while she was walking. She had edema in both legs. The white-cell count\\, platelet count\\, and blood levels of electrolytes\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, bilirubin\\, albumin\\, and hemoglobin were normal\\, as were test results for kidney function. Dr. Sandra P. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and bilateral interstitial opacities. Dr. Marinacci: Hydrochlorothiazide was prescribed. At a follow-up evaluation 2 weeks later\\, the patient\u2019s weight had decreased by 5 kg\\, but the exertional dyspnea and bilateral leg edema were unchanged. The N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide level was normal\\, and the d-dimer level was 3259 ng per milliliter (reference value\\, <500). Dr. Rincon: Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the chest\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, showed no pulmonary emboli. A dilated main pulmonary artery\\, mosaic attenuation of the lungs\\, and coronary-artery calcifications were present. Dr. Marinacci: Four weeks later\\, the patient presented to her primary care physician with increased exertional dyspnea. Her weight had decreased by 2 kg. The peak expiratory flow was 220 liters per second (expected value according to age\\, sex\\, and height\\, 350). A tapering course of prednisone and inhaled albuterol were prescribed\\, and her condition improved initially. The patient was lost to follow-up; her next visit took place 10 months before the current evaluation. At that time\\, the patient reported recurrent exertional dyspnea\\, which occurred when she moved from room to room. She reported an episode of transient facial asymmetry with saliva dripping from the left side of her mouth that had developed while she was washing herself; later that day\\, her sister had noticed that she was slurring words during a telephone call. The white-cell count\\, platelet count\\, and blood levels of thyrotropin\\, glycated hemoglobin\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, bilirubin\\, albumin\\, and hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

An examination was notable for diffuse crackles in both lung fields. Dr. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed pulmonary edema and a small right pleural effusion. Dr. Marinacci: Intravenous furosemide was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal biventricular wall thickness\\, size\\, and function. Mild biatrial enlargement\\, a patent foramen ovale with mild left-to-right shunting\\, moderate tricuspid regurgitation\\, and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg were noted. On the day before the current evaluation\\, the patient called her primary care physician to report sore throat with difficulty swallowing that had started 2 days earlier. Because she had slurred speech over the phone\\, she was referred to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department\\, the patient reported dysphagia with food\\, liquids\\, and medications. Her daughter reported that her voice had sounded \u201cgarbled\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d during the preceding days and also during an episode of transient dysarthria that had developed a few months earlier. Dyspnea and mild leg edema had been present for at least 3 years\\, along with some orthopnea and an intermittent nonproductive cough. The patient had started using a walker in the past year owing to exertional fatigue\\, arthritic pain\\, and weakness in both legs. Two falls had occurred in the previous 8 months. In addition\\, the patient reported increased generalized weakness and limb weakness\\, daytime somnolence\\, and fatigue. She had no diplopia\\, numbness\\, dizziness\\, headache\\, chest pain\\, palpitations\\, bleeding\\, nausea\\, abdominal pain\\, constipation\\, diarrhea\\, or urinary symptoms. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for severe obesity\\, coronary-artery calcifications\\, hypertension\\, hyperlipidemia\\, atrial flutter\\, and hyperparathyroidism. Medications included furosemide\\, apixaban\\, aspirin\\, amlodipine\\, lisinopril\\, metoprolol\\, lovastatin\\, metformin\\, and sertraline. She had had no known adverse drug reactions. The patient was retired and divorced\\, and she lived alone in an assisted-living community. She had smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 15 years but had quit smoking 20 years earlier\\, and she did not drink alcohol or use other substances. Her family history was notable for ischemic heart disease. Her father had had myocardial infarctions; a paternal cousin had systemic lupus erythematosus. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C\\, the heart rate 76 beats per minute\\, the blood pressure 154/88 mm Hg\\, the respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 124 kg\\, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 53.1. The patient was appropriately oriented\\, and her speech was fluent. She appeared to have increased work of breathing. The oropharynx was clear; no stridor was noted. Auscultation revealed an irregular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur at the base of the left sternal border and crackles in both lungs. The patient had pitting edema in both legs with venous stasis dermatitis and had tenderness of the knees with mild crepitus but no erythema or effusion. The white-cell count\\, platelet count\\, and blood levels of calcium\\, magnesium\\, phosphate\\, creatine kinase\\, lactate\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, bilirubin\\, albumin\\, globulin\\, lipase\\, and hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 1+ protein. Testing of an oropharyngeal swab for group A streptococcal antigen was negative\\, and a throat culture showed no growth. Dr. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette\\, low lung volumes\\, and bilateral interstitial opacities (Figure 1A). FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies. Dr. Marinacci: Electrocardiography was notable for atrial flutter with a ventricular rate of 75 beats per minute\\, a rightward axis\\, and low precordial QRS voltage. On the first night in the emergency department\\, the patient was unable to lie flat to sleep because of dyspnea. Intravenous furosemide was administered\\, along with continuous positive airway pressure (with a pressure of 10 cm of water and a rate of 4 liters of oxygen per minute). Cardiology and neurology consultations were requested. Dr. Rincon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head and CTA of the head and neck showed chronic lacunar infarcts and chronic hypertensive microangiopathy (Figure 1B). No high-grade stenosis or large-vessel occlusion was noted. CT of the neck and mediastinum showed no mass or lymphadenopathy (Figure 1C). Dr. Marinacci: On the second day\\, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of slurred speech\\, voice changes\\, and dyspnea. The examination was notable for tachypnea and a new onset of forgetfulness. The dysarthria was most pronounced with guttural sounds. She also had facial droop on the right side\\, subtle ptosis in the right eye\\, slight weakness in the proximal muscles on both sides\\, pronator drift on the left side\\, and the Babinski reflex in the right foot. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Rincon: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck showed findings similar to those seen on CT. No evidence of acute infarction was noted (Figure 1D). Scattered foci of susceptibility signal were present in the cerebral hemispheres\\, basal ganglia\\, and thalami\\, findings consistent with chronic microhemorrhages. MRA showed widely patent intracranial and cervical arteries (Figure 1E and 1F). Dr. Marinacci: On the third day\\, the patient was somnolent and was using accessory muscles for breathing until bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated. An evaluation revealed weak cough and delayed swallow initiation. Owing to the degree of dysphagia\\, it was recommended that the patient avoid oral medications and food. The thyrotropin level was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Direct laryngoscopy showed an impaired swallow\\, normal vocal cords\\, and no mass or other source of obstruction. Intravenous furosemide and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam and inhaled ipratropium were administered. Diagnostic tests were performed\\, and management decisions were made.,Myasthenia gravis."

    "ground_truth_output": "when she noticed a lump in the left lower jaw; there was no pain\\, tenderness\\, or discomfort in the jaw. She was evaluated in a primary care clinic of another hospital and was told that a salivary gland may be obstructed. Treatment with sialagogues\\, increased oral hydration\\, warm compresses\\, and massage of the salivary glands were recommended. During the next 3 weeks\\, the lump in the left jaw increased in size\\, and swelling of the left side of the face and neck developed. Three weeks before this admission\\, she returned to the primary care clinic; treatment with cephalexin was started. Eighteen days before this admission\\, the patient was evaluated in the otolaryngology clinic of the other hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 132/90 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 86 beats per minute\\, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.0. There was swelling in the left mandibular and submandibular areas\\, with no erythema\\, fluctuance\\, or palpable salivary stones. Dr. Hillary R. Kelly: Computed tomography (CT) of the face and neck was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the face (Figure 1) revealed a 3.7-cm mass in the left mandibular body\\, with lytic and expansile features and numerous internal wavy septations. Areas of marked thinning and obliteration were noted in the buccal and lingual cortexes of the mandible\\, and extension of the mass among the roots of the first molar\\, second molar\\, and premolar was observed. No fluid\u2013fluid or blood\u2013fluid levels were seen within the lesion. There was no lymphadenopathy. The patient was referred to the otolaryngology clinic at this hospital. FIGURE 1  CT Images of the Face. Dr. Be: Fifteen days before this admission\\, the patient reported numbness and tingling in the lower lip and chin on the left side. She had had no fatigue\\, fever\\, chills\\, or redness and no pain in her face\\, jaw\\, or neck. On examination\\, she appeared well but had obvious facial asymmetry with swelling of the left mandible (Figure 2). There was a firm\\, mildly tender mass in the body of the left mandible that extended to the mandibular angle. Orthodontic braces were in place and dentition and jaw occlusion were normal. The remainder of the ear\\, nose\\, and throat examination was normal. The overlying skin was normal\\, and no anterior or posterior submandibular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was present. The blood levels of sodium\\, potassium\\, and chloride were normal\\, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of coagulation and renal function. The calcium level was 11.8 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter])\\, and the albumin level was 4.1 g per deciliter (reference range\\, 3.3 to 5.0). Radiography of the chest was normal. FIGURE 2  Clinical Photographs before Excision of the Lesion. Dr. Vania Nos\u00e9: An intraoral biopsy of the left mandibular mass was performed. Pathological examination (Figure 3C) of the biopsy specimen revealed that the lesion was partially surrounded by reactive bone trabeculae\\, was hemorrhagic\\, and contained numerous osteoclast-type giant cells around extravasated red cells\\, findings that were consistent with a central giant-cell lesion or a central giant-cell granuloma. FIGURE 3  Surgical Approach and Biopsy and Surgical Specimens. Dr. Be: Ten days before this admission\\, the patient was seen in the oral and maxillofacial surgical clinic of this hospital\\, and admission for the excision of the left mandibular mass was planned. On admission to this hospital\\, additional history was obtained. The patient had normal growth and development and had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had finished the prescribed course of cephalexin and had taken no other medications; penicillin had caused fever and hives early in childhood. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her mother\\, stepfather\\, and two cats; she frequently stayed in another suburban area of New England with her father. The patient performed well in high school and participated in theater. She did not smoke tobacco\\, use illicit drugs\\, or drink alcohol. Her mother had hypothyroidism; her father had obstructive sleep apnea. Her maternal grandmother had a history of hypothyroidism\\, parathyroid adenoma\\, breast cancer\\, and colon cancer; her paternal grandfather had died from colon cancer. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 128/85 mm Hg\\, and the heart rate 111 beats per minute. The physical examination was unchanged. The left mandibular mass was excised. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed abundant giant cells. On the second hospital day\\, the calcium level was 12.6 mg per deciliter (3.2 mmol per liter) and the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 396 pg per milliliter (reference range\\, 10 to 60). A diagnosis was made.,Primary hyperparathyroidism and brown tumor."

    "ground_truth_output": "while he was running\\, he had episodes of flushing with diffuse cutaneous swelling involving the face\\, lips\\, hands\\, and trunk\\, along with hives on the abdomen and legs and associated dyspnea. The first episode occurred in autumn and the second episode the following summer. After the second episode\\, he lost consciousness while sitting on a bench. The next day\\, he was evaluated at an urgent care center. A Holter monitor was placed\\, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was reportedly normal. The patient consulted with an allergist\\, who made a diagnosis of food-related exercise-induced anaphylaxis with reactions to soybeans\\, chickpeas\\, and tahini\\, on the basis of the foods he had eaten before these episodes and the results of radioallergosorbent testing. An epinephrine autoinjector was prescribed for use during future episodes\\, but the anaphylaxis symptoms did not recur. Approximately 4 months before the current evaluation\\, during a routine 5-mile jog\\, the patient had a new sensation that he described as \u201cmy heart beating out of my chest.\u201d He rested\\, and the symptom subsided; he completed his run. One month later\\, during a bicycle ride\\, he had \u201ccrampy\u201d discomfort in the anterior chest\\, which abated when he stopped cycling. Two weeks before the current evaluation\\, during a jog of several miles\\, he had cramping pain in the anterior chest on the left side that gradually escalated over a 5-minute period. He started walking\\, and the pain abated; he ran for an additional 20 minutes without a recurrence of pain. He sought an evaluation in the cardiology clinic of this hospital to determine the cause of his symptoms and the safety of continued vigorous exercise. On evaluation in the cardiology clinic\\, a review of systems was negative for dyspnea\\, recent syncope\\, orthopnea\\, edema\\, cough\\, hemoptysis\\, and recent allergic symptoms. The patient ran or cycled four times per week and had previously completed a marathon. His medical history included attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. Five years earlier\\, an episode of syncope had occurred in the context of multiple episodes of nonbloody diarrhea\\, abdominal discomfort\\, and chills. His surgical history included two colonic polypectomies\\, one 6 years before this evaluation and the other 1 month before this evaluation; pathological examination of the polyps had revealed lymphoid aggregates and hyperplastic polyps. The patient took no medications and reported no adverse reactions to medications. The patient worked in the financial sector and lived with his wife and children. He did not use tobacco\\, alcohol\\, or other substances. Multiple maternal relatives had had colon cancer\\, and an older brother had had colonic polyps removed in his fourth decade of life. There was a family history of hypertension. On examination\\, the blood pressure was 122/84 mm Hg (measured in both arms)\\, the heart rate 54 beats per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were mild expiratory wheezes; the remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities\\, findings that had been observed on tracings obtained 5 years earlier during an evaluation for presyncope; a TTE obtained at that time had been normal. Sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities had not been observed on tracings obtained 15 years earlier (Figure 1A\\, 1B\\, and 1C). The white-cell count and platelet count were normal\\, as were blood levels of hemoglobin\\, electrolytes\\, calcium\\, and thyrotropin and results of renal-function tests. The high-sensitivity troponin level was 10 ng per liter (reference range\\, 0 to 14). Plasma metanephrines were undetectable\\, and the normetanephrine level was normal. The next day\\, a TTE showed no abnormalities of cardiac chamber size and function and no evidence of valvular dysfunction. FIGURE 1  Electrocardiograms and Transthoracic Echocardiograms. An ambulatory patch heart monitor\\, applied to evaluate cardiac rhythm over a 2-week period\\, revealed sinus rhythm without arrhythmia. A cardiopulmonary exercise stress test was performed; the patient exercised for 19 minutes 17 seconds according to a treadmill protocol that increased incrementally to maximal effort with a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.12 and a maximum heart rate of 181 beats per minute (99% of the age-predicted maximum). At peak effort\\, the stress test did not reproduce symptoms\\, and he stopped because of leg fatigue. An ECG showed 0.5-mm horizontal ST-segment depression in leads III\\, aVF\\, V3\\, and V6\\, along with isolated premature ventricular contractions. The ventilatory efficiency was normal.

    "user_input": "Dr. Lara Basovic: A 41-year-old man was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) of this hospital because of seizures. When the patient was 4 years of age\\",
    "ground_truth_output": "his mother noticed an episode of staring and unresponsiveness. At 19 years of age\\, he was the driver in a single-vehicle accident in which the car rolled over. The patient did not recall the events or seek medical evaluation after the accident. Approximately 15 years before this admission\\, the patient received a diagnosis of epilepsy when episodes of staring to the left and unresponsiveness occurred. The seizures were preceded by a \u201cbad feeling\u201d in the epigastric region and were followed by confusion\\, agitation\\, or somnolence. An electroencephalogram (EEG) reportedly revealed bitemporal sharp waves\\, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head reportedly showed possible asymmetry in the temporal horns. The focal seizures initially occurred weekly and progressed to generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures. During the subsequent 15 years\\, the patient received treatment with various medications and adjusted doses of various antiseizure medications\\, and seizures occurred approximately once per month. During the 3 months before this admission\\, the frequency of seizures increased to up to three times monthly\\, despite adherence to his prescribed medications\\, which included carbamazepine\\, levetiracetam\\, and topiramate. The patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of another hospital\\, and the doses of carbamazepine and levetiracetam were increased. Four weeks before this admission\\, the patient had had five seizures in 2 weeks. Two weeks before this admission\\, coworkers witnessed shaking of his arms and legs and called emergency medical services. The patient was transported to the emergency department of the other hospital. He received a prescription for diazepam\\, which was to be taken as needed at night for insomnia\\, and was discharged home. The next day\\, the patient\u2019s neurologist was commuting to his office when he spotted the patient stumbling on the side of the road. The patient was behaving erratically and did not respond to questions or commands. Law enforcement was called\\, and the patient tried to run away. He was restrained and taken to the emergency department of the other hospital. The behavior and confusion resolved\\, and the patient was referred to the EMU of this hospital for additional evaluation. On the day of this scheduled admission\\, the patient described stress at work\\, inadequate sleep\\, and adherence to his prescribed antiseizure medications. On a review of systems\\, he noted that he had had \u201cblurriness\u201d of memory for a few days after each seizure; however\\, he had been able to function well at work. He had no fever\\, chills\\, malaise\\, or headache. During the admission interview\\, the patient said that something strange was about to happen. His vision became blurred\\, and both thighs moved nonrhythmically. The patient was aware of these events and noted that they were not typical symptoms of his seizures. The patient had no known medical problems other than epilepsy. Medications included carbamazepine\\, topiramate\\, levetiracetam\\, and cholecalciferol\\, as well as diazepam as needed for sleep. He had no known drug allergies. The patient was born in a Caribbean country and had moved to coastal New England 5 years before this admission to live with his mother and aunt. He worked as a skilled tradesman. He did not drink alcohol\\, use illicit drugs\\, or smoke cigarettes. His two sisters were healthy\\, and his maternal grandmother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease. There was no family history of seizures or psychiatric disease. The results of a physical examination\\, including vital signs\\, mental status\\, mood\\, and affect\\, were normal. Dr. Javier M. Romero: The initial MRI of the head revealed decreased volume of the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus with increased signal intensity on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging. Ex-vacuo dilatation of the left temporal horn was present\\, which was most likely secondary to the volume loss (Figure 1A). Interictal positron-emission tomography of the head was performed\\, which showed subtle reduction of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the left mesial temporal lobe (Figure 1B). Figure 1  Initial Imaging Studies and EEG. Dr. Basovic: During the patient\u2019s first 3 days at this hospital\\, the doses of carbamazepine and levetiracetam were decreased gradually\\, and topiramate was continued. No electroclinical or electrographic seizures were observed (Figure 1C). During the fourth and fifth hospital days\\, the dose of carbamazepine was further decreased\\, and levetiracetam was stopped. A total of five seizures were observed\\, with staring and subtle movements in both legs that occurred for up to 3 minutes. EEG was performed\\, which revealed that most electroclinical seizure events originated from the left temporal lobe focus (Figure 2A); one event originated from the right temporal lobe (Figure 2B). After the second seizure\\, the patient tried to remove the EEG electrodes and leave the room. He bit and kicked the clinicians who tried to stop him. Security personnel were called\\, and intravenous haloperidol and lorazepam were administered. Between seizures\\, the patient was calm and cooperative without agitation. The dose of carbamazepine was increased. Figure 2  EEGs Obtained during Hospital Course. On the patient\u2019s sixth hospital day\\, the blood pressure increased to 160/100 mm Hg\\, and the pulse increased to 120 beats per minute. Sixteen hours after the fifth seizure\\, he pressed the seizure alarm button three times during episodes of leg weakness and \u201cfoggy\u201d vision. He answered questions with one-word answers and held his hand to his chest\\, saying that his heart felt \u201coff.\u201d He had auditory hallucinations of a keyboard playing and stated\\, \u201cPlease don\u2019t fire those three girls.\u201d Treatment with oral labetalol and lorazepam was started\\, and the dose of carbamazepine was further increased. On the seventh hospital day\\, the patient dismantled a metal piece from the table in his room. He then held the door closed and refused to allow staff to enter and threatened them. When a staff member approached the patient\\, he struck that person with the metal piece. Security personnel were called\\, intravenous haloperidol was administered\\, and the patient was temporarily placed into four-point restraints. The dose of carbamazepine was further increased\\, treatment with levetiracetam was restarted\\, and risperidone was started. The agitation resolved\\, and additional history was obtained. The patient explained his combative behavior by stating\\, \u201cI thought they were trying to kill me\\,\u201d and also said\\, \u201cThat\u2019s not me.\u201d He was concerned about the staff member who was struck and asked if that person was hurt. He had had no previous episodes of anger or violence\\, although he frequently had a feeling of fearfulness after seizures that made him want to be away from other people and on his own. He did not report auditory or visual hallucinations or paranoia\\, and he had never received a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder. During the subsequent 3 days\\, carbamazepine\\, levetiracetam\\, and topiramate were administered at the preadmission doses\\, treatment with lorazepam was continued\\, and clobazam was started. He intermittently declined to take medications\\, especially the medications that were started in the hospital\\, such as labetalol and risperidone. Treatment with oral carbamazepine was transitioned to intravenous lacosamide. The patient had additional episodes of foggy vision\\, anxiety\\, restlessness\\, impulsivity\\, and agitation. He perseverated on the idea that God had saved him. He insisted that he needed to call his mother to tell her that \u201cit\u2019s the end.\u201d He asked her for help because he believed he would be killed in the hospital. He was seen trying to eat a mobile telephone. Two-point and four-point restraints were placed intermittently.,Psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition (postictal psychosis)."

    "ground_truth_output": "when he noticed white \u201csparkles\u201d flickering in the vision of the left eye\\, followed by sudden blurriness. He had no floaters or eye pain. During the next 2 minutes\\, the blurry vision worsened and became \u201cdark\\,\u201d such that the patient could not see a hand in front of his face when he covered the right eye. He presented to this hospital for evaluation\\, arriving 1 hour after the onset of vision symptoms. On presentation\\, the patient noted that the vision in the left eye was improving but remained blurry. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 92 beats per minute\\, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.2. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and was limited to hand motions at 0.9 m (3.0 ft) in the left eye; 2 hours later\\, visual acuity in the left eye was 20/40 for distance vision and 20/30 with correction for near vision. Results of the Ishihara color test were normal. The pupils were equal\\, round\\, and reactive to light\\, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were intact; visual fields were full in response to confrontation. Intraocular pressure and results of a slit-lamp examination of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye were normal bilaterally. There was severe ptosis of the left upper eyelid (margin reflex distance\\, 4 mm in the right eye and 1 mm in the left eye). A dilated fundus examination revealed normal optic disks\\, maculae\\, and vessels. A nontender\\, irregular mass was palpable under the left superior orbital rim\\, but there was no proptosis. The temporal arteries were prominent bilaterally\\, more so on the right side than on the left side\\, with normal pulsations and no tenderness. There was no tenderness of the scalp or temporomandibular joints. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. A review of systems was notable for fatigue and weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past year\\, which the patient attributed to inactivity and decreased appetite. There was a 2-month history of bilateral jaw pain with chewing of firm foods but not with soft foods. There was lateral hip soreness in both hips after walking but no stiffness. There was a sensation of locking when flexing or extending the right first finger. Two days before evaluation\\, the patient had a temporal headache on the right side that resolved. He reported no numbness or weakness. The patient had a history of presbyopia. He had not undergone any surgeries\\, was not currently taking any medications\\, and had no known allergies. He was born and raised in a country in Eurasia and had lived in the United States for 20 years. He traveled internationally for his work as a university professor. He was divorced and lived with his two children in a house in New England. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes for 5 years but had quit smoking 20 years earlier. He drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. His parents were alive and well\\, both of his grandmothers had had breast cancer\\, and there was no family history of ocular or autoimmune disease. Laboratory evaluation revealed normocytic anemia and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, and alkaline phosphatase. Results of tests of kidney and thyroid function were normal\\, as were blood levels of electrolytes\\, calcium\\, glucose\\, glycated hemoglobin\\, creatine kinase\\, homocysteine\\, and lipoprotein(a). Testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative\\, and levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

The masslike lesion showed a hypointense signal on short-tau inversion recovery imaging. The brain parenchyma was normal. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck was normal\\, as was ultrasonography of the temporal arteries. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed markedly heterogeneous liver parenchyma and an enlarged periportal lymph node\\, measuring 2 cm in largest dimension. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest\\, abdomen\\, and pelvis (Figure 1)\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed multiple punctate calcifications throughout the liver and hypoattenuation of the right hepatic lobe\\, as well as diffuse coalescent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications. There was a prominent right hilar lymph node\\, measuring 10 mm in diameter. The lung parenchyma was unremarkable. FIGURE 1  Imaging Studies. Dr. Serling-Boyd: On the second hospital day\\, diplopia occurred when the patient looked to the far right. On examination\\, there was mild limitation of abduction of the right eye. After a second dose of intravenous methylprednisolone was administered\\, the patient chose to leave the hospital against medical advice. After discharge\\, he took prednisone daily. During the next week\\, additional laboratory test results became available. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) was negative. Blood testing for blastomyces antigen\\, coccidioides antibodies\\, and histoplasma antibodies was negative\\, as was an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

He was treated with a wide local excision; a biopsy of the sentinel lymph node was negative for melanoma. One year before the current evaluation\\, the patient began to have slurred speech and weakness in the left hand. Imaging revealed a mass lesion in the parietal lobe of the brain and another mass in the hilum of the left lung. Craniotomy with resection of the brain mass was performed; pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with melanoma\\, as did a biopsy of the lung mass. Seizures developed postoperatively\\, and treatment with levetiracetam was initiated. Further treatment included radiation therapy targeting the parietal resection cavity and the administration of pembrolizumab. Four months before the current evaluation\\, after seven cycles of pembrolizumab\\, the blood thyrotropin level was 9.4 \u03bcIU per milliliter (reference range\\, 0.4 to 5.0) and the free thyroxine level 0.9 ng per deciliter (12 pmol per liter; reference range\\, 0.9 to 1.8 ng per deciliter [12 to 23 pmol per liter]); treatment with levothyroxine was initiated.

    "ground_truth_output": "lethargy\\, weakness\\, and hypoxemia. The patient had been well until 7 days before the current presentation\\, when irritability and frequent crying developed. One day before the current presentation\\, the episodes of crying increased in duration\\, and the patient\u2019s grandmother noticed that he cried more intensely when the right side of his abdomen was touched. The patient was evaluated at the pediatric primary care clinic of another hospital. The vital signs and physical examination were reportedly normal\\, and a diagnosis of discomfort due to gastrointestinal gas was considered. After the patient returned home\\, he had a crying episode that lasted for multiple hours while he was awake; the crying stopped while he was fully asleep. After he woke up\\, the crying continued for 8 hours and became weaker. During breast-feeding\\, the patient fed less vigorously than usual\\, and the latch onto the nipple was weaker. That night\\, the crying continued\\, and the patient became inconsolable. He had frantic movements of the arms and legs and slept only 1 hour. On the day of the current presentation\\, the inconsolable crying continued. The patient did not latch onto the nipple\\, and his mother expressed breast milk directly into his mouth. A family member called the pediatric primary care clinic and was instructed to bring the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department\\, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family members. There had been no change in the frequency of wet diapers; the last bowel movement had occurred 2 days before this presentation. The patient had been born at a gestational age of 39 weeks 1 day by a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery after a normal pregnancy. The birth weight had been 4.5 kg (98th percentile)\\, the length 54.6 cm (99th percentile)\\, and the head circumference 36.5 cm (94th percentile). The patient had met normal developmental milestones. He had not yet received the routine immunizations recommended for 2-month-old infants. Medications included vitamin D supplements; there were no known medication allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with his grandmother\\, who primarily cared for him\\, as well as his mother\\, father\\, and sister. His mother had depression\\, anxiety\\, and anemia. His father and sister were healthy. On examination\\, the axillary temperature was 37.2\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 100/76 mm Hg\\, the heart rate 153 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 7.1 kg (99th percentile)\\, the height 62.5 cm (>99th percentile)\\, and the head circumference 41.5 cm (99th percentile). The patient was alert but irritable. He cried weakly and could not be soothed. The anterior fontanelle was open\\, soft\\, and flat. The mucous membranes were moist. The heart rate was tachycardic and regular. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft\\, with no hepatosplenomegaly. The results of the testicular examination were normal. There was no rash. The blood levels of glucose\\, lactic acid\\, lipase\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, and bilirubin were normal\\, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 621\\,000 per microliter (reference range\\, 150\\,000 to 400\\,000); the remainder of the complete blood count and differential count was normal. The results of urinalysis and urine toxicology screening were normal. Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\\, influenza A and B viruses\\, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

He was admitted to this hospital. Four hours after presentation\\, lethargy developed. Additional testing was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture was performed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The CSF glucose level was 54 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter])\\, and the CSF protein level was 104 mg per deciliter (reference range\\, 5 to 55); there were 1055 red cells per microliter and 2 nucleated cells per microliter\\, of which 70% were lymphocytes. A diagnosis of meningitis was considered. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin\\, ceftriaxone\\, and acyclovir was started. Six hours after presentation\\, increased work of breathing developed\\, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation increased to 100%. The patient was transferred to the PICU. Dr. Sarah A. Murphy: On arrival at the PICU\\, the patient was difficult to arouse. He had grunting respirations\\, head-bobbing\\, intercostal retractions\\, and an exaggerated abdominal breathing pattern. With vigorous stimulation\\, the patient had a weak hypophonic cry\\, gurgling\\, and stertor on inspiration. Ptosis was present in both eyes. When the eyes were opened by the examiner\\, the pupils were equal\\, round\\, and reactive. The face appeared symmetric and placid. There were few spontaneous movements of the arms\\, and the patient did not move his arms against gravity. There was no spontaneous movement of the legs\\, and diffuse hypotonia was present. Muscle bulk was normal and symmetric. Reflexes were decreased but preserved. Tracheal intubation was performed\\, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Tachycardia and hypertension persisted despite the administration of boluses of sedative and analgesic agents and the initiation of continuous infusions of opioids and benzodiazepines. A diagnostic test was performed.,Infant botulism."

    "ground_truth_output": "the patient received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus after nausea\\, vomiting\\, polyuria\\, and polydipsia had developed. At that time\\, the weight was 113 kg\\, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 45.6. Treatment with metformin was started\\, along with subcutaneous insulin glargine at a dose of 10 units daily. The patient had adverse effects associated with metformin\\, so treatment with metformin was discontinued and glipizide was started. During the next 3.5 years\\, despite progressive weight loss\\, the patient\u2019s glycemic control worsened\\, which resulted in gradual intensification of her glucose-lowering regimen. Two years before the current presentation\\, the patient moved to the Boston area and established care at a clinic affiliated with another hospital. The weight was 63 kg\\, and the BMI was 25.4. Medications for diabetes included subcutaneous insulin glargine (20 units daily) and glipizide\\, and the glycated hemoglobin level was 13.2% (reference range\\, 4.3 to 5.6). Treatment with empagliflozin was started but then stopped because of a urinary tract infection. The dose of subcutaneous insulin glargine was increased to 30 units daily\\, and treatment with subcutaneous insulin lispro\\, administered at a dose of 10 units three times a day with meals\\, was added. Treatment with glipizide was stopped\\, and treatment with glimepiride and pioglitazone was started. One year before the current presentation\\, the weight was 48 kg\\, and the BMI was 19.4. Medications for diabetes included subcutaneous insulin glargine (34 units daily)\\, subcutaneous insulin lispro (15 units three times a day with meals)\\, glimepiride\\, and pioglitazone\\, and the glycated hemoglobin level was 14.0%. Anorexia had developed\\, along with fatigue. Although the patient reported eating very little\\, the blood glucose levels remained markedly elevated. Nine months before the current presentation\\, the weight was 42 kg\\, and the BMI was 16.9. Medications for diabetes included subcutaneous insulin glargine (46 units daily)\\, subcutaneous insulin lispro (20 units three times a day with meals)\\, glimepiride\\, and pioglitazone\\, and the glycated hemoglobin level was 11.0%. Six months before the current presentation\\, persistent abdominal pain developed\\, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, reportedly did not show evidence of obstruction\\, perforation\\, or abscess. The abdominal pain was attributed to gastroparesis; treatment with gabapentin\\, metoclopramide\\, and oxycodone was started. During the hospitalization\\, the patient was found to have profound hyperglycemia without diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome. The glycated hemoglobin level was 15.5%. Testing was negative for antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase\\, islet antigen 2\\, and zinc transporter 8. A diagnosis of lipodystrophy was considered. Treatment with human regular U-500 insulin\\, given in daily doses of 250 units with breakfast and 200 units each with lunch and dinner\\, was started; treatment with subcutaneous insulin glargine and subcutaneous insulin lispro was stopped. The patient was discharged home. Subsequent to this hospitalization\\, a gastric-emptying study reportedly showed normal emptying at 1 hour. Two months before the current presentation\\, the abdominal pain worsened\\, and the patient was again admitted to the other hospital. Her hyperglycemia was initially treated with continuous intravenous insulin at doses of up to 40 units per hour. When the blood glucose level improved\\, treatment with intravenous insulin was stopped. Treatment with human regular U-500 insulin was then resumed at an increased dose (550 units each with breakfast and lunch and 450 units with dinner); treatment with isophane insulin\\, also known as neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin\\, was started at a dose of 80 units twice a day. The abdominal pain subsided with improved glycemic control\\, and the patient was discharged home. Over the course of the 2 months between hospital discharge and the current presentation\\, the patient had five additional admissions to the other hospital because of abdominal pain and hyperglycemia. During each admission\\, the hyperglycemia was treated with high-dose intravenous insulin\\, the abdominal pain abated with improved blood glucose levels\\, and the patient was discharged home. During one admission\\, endoscopy was performed and reportedly revealed erosive gastritis and duodenitis due to infection with Helicobacter pylori\\, for which the patient was treated with amoxicillin\\, clarithromycin\\, bismuth subsalicylate\\, and pantoprazole. Nine days before the current presentation\\, the abdominal pain worsened\\, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of the other hospital. Treatment with intravenous insulin was initiated\\, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day\\, treatment with intravenous insulin was stopped\\, and treatment with human regular U-500 insulin was resumed at an increased dose of 650 units each with breakfast and lunch and 600 units with dinner; treatment with NPH insulin was also restarted at a dose of 80 units twice a day. She was transferred to this hospital for further care. On arrival at this hospital\\, the patient reported constant epigastric abdominal pain. She also reported that she had been administering her subcutaneous insulin medications at home without missed doses and confirmed that she had been rotating the injection sites on her abdomen. Other medical history included depression\\, as well as anemia and leukopenia; a bone marrow biopsy performed 7 months earlier revealed mild-to-moderate fibrosis with patchy myxoid degeneration. She had numbness and tingling in the hands and feet that had begun 9 months before the current presentation. Her menses had stopped 14 months before the current presentation. Other medications included acetaminophen\\, fluoxetine\\, gabapentin\\, glipizide\\, hydromorphone\\, lorazepam\\, mirtazapine\\, oxycodone\\, pancrelipase\\, pantoprazole\\, and pioglitazone. She had no known drug allergies. The patient was Black and lived in Boston with her husband and children; she had previously worked as a chef but was not working at the time of the current presentation. She rarely drank alcohol or smoked marijuana and had never smoked tobacco; she did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes\\, and her father had liver disease. On examination\\, the temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C\\, the blood pressure 108/78 mm Hg\\, the pulse 98 beats per minute\\, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute\\, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 42 kg\\, and the BMI was 17.0. The patient appeared cachectic with a diffuse absence of body fat and muscle mass. Her face had acromegaly-like features\\, including broadening of the nose and thickening of the lips (Figure 1). Acanthosis nigricans was present\\, most notably in the neck and axillae. She had skin tags on the face and neck\\, and vitiligo was present on the ears and on the fingers of the right hand. The abdomen was soft\\, nondistended\\, and diffusely tender on palpation\\, without rebound or guarding; there was no hepatosplenomegaly. There was skin breakdown in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. FIGURE 1  Clinical Photographs. Laboratory testing showed a fasting blood glucose level of 311 mg per deciliter (17.3 mmol per liter; reference range\\, 70 to 100 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter]) and a C-peptide level of 12.1 ng per milliliter (reference range\\, 1.1 to 4.4). Blood levels of cholesterol\\, triglycerides\\, aspartate aminotransferase\\, alanine aminotransferase\\, alkaline phosphatase\\, total bilirubin\\, total complement\\, C3\\, and C4 were normal. The blood level of leptin was undetectable\\, and the blood level of adiponectin was 24.5 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range\\, 2.9 to 30.4). A screening test for human immunodeficiency virus was negative. Testing for antibodies to nuclear antigens was positive at a titer of 1:320 with a homogeneous pattern; testing for antibodies to double-stranded DNA was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a normal pattern with a mild diffuse increase in the gamma globulin level. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were performed.

Tsai: CT of the abdomen and pelvis\\, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material\\, revealed a near-complete absence of both visceral and subcutaneous fat\\, with multiple skin folds reflecting a clinically significant lack of fat (Figure 2). There was no bowel dilatation. The pancreas was atrophic\\, a finding commonly seen in patients with chronic insulin-dependent diabetes.1 There were bilateral\\, nonobstructing renal stones measuring up to 3 mm in diameter. The attenuation level of the liver was 58 Hounsfield units (HU)\\, which is not consistent with hepatic steatosis (which is usually defined by an attenuation level of <40 HU).2 A nonspecific\\, round 3.3-cm hypodense lesion at the upper aspect of the spleen was noted.
