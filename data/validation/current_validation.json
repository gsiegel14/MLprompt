    "user_input": "Dr. Margaret R. Connolly (Surgery): A 15-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and an ovarian mass.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 6 weeks before the current presentation, when lower abdominal pain developed along the midline. The pain was sharp and crampy, increased with movement, and decreased with lying down. During the next 24 hours, the pain shifted from the midline to the right side. The patient was taken to the emergency department of a hospital affiliated with this hospital for evaluation.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 125/82 mm Hg, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The lower abdomen had mild tenderness that was present on both sides but was greater on the right side. The abdomen was soft and nondistended. Bowel sounds were normal, and there was no rebound, guarding, or tenderness at the costovertebral angle. The white-cell count was 14,270 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,500) and the hemoglobin level 10.9 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The urinalysis was normal. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were performed.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), 6 Wk before Current Presentation (Other Hospital), On Current Presentation (This Hospital)\n\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201313,500, 14,270, 16,120\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l)\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20138000, 10,130, 12,280\nLymphocytes, 1500\u20136500, 2680, 2450\nMonocytes, 100\u2013900, 1150, 1190\nEosinophils, 0\u2013400, 200, 50\nBasophils, 0\u2013200, 70, 50\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201316.0, 10.9, 10.1\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 33.3, 29.9\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 135,000\u2013400,000, 343,000, 275,000\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201320, \u2014, 19\nC\u2011reactive protein (mg/liter), 0.0\u20138.0, 5.9, 27.7\n\nDr. Ali Pourvaziri: Transabdominal ultrasonography with Doppler analysis revealed a complex, thick-walled cyst in the right ovary. There were multiple follicular cysts, measuring up to 1.7 cm in diameter, in the left ovary. Doppler flow was normal in both ovaries. There was a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. The appendix was not visualized.\nDr. Connolly: Acetaminophen, ketorolac, and intravenous fluids were administered. A diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst was considered, and the patient was discharged home with plans to undergo repeat transabdominal ultrasonography 6 weeks later.\nAfter the patient was discharged from the emergency department, the abdominal pain slowly resolved. Three days after discharge, the patient resumed competitive long-distance running. Five weeks later, and 4 days before the current presentation, she participated in a running competition. The next day, abdominal pain recurred, and the patient was unable to go to school. She took ibuprofen, but it did not alleviate the pain. She was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nThe patient reported that the current episode of abdominal pain was similar to the episode that had occurred 6 weeks earlier. She had no fever, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dysuria, hematuria, frequent urination, or vaginal bleeding or discharge. She had noticed an increase in her waist size during the past 2 weeks and had difficulty fitting into her pants.\nThe patient had no notable medical history. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She had normal growth and development; menarche had not occurred. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. The patient lived in suburban New England with her parents and sister. She was not sexually active and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her parents and sister were healthy; menarche had occurred in her mother and sister when they were each 12 years of age.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/89 mm Hg, and the pulse 95 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.7. The right lower abdomen was firm and distended, with mild tenderness. Bowel sounds were normal, and there was no rebound, guarding, or evidence of a discrete mass or hepatosplenomegaly on palpation. Development of pubic hair and breasts was classified as Tanner stage 4 (with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development). The white-cell count was 16,120 per microliter and the hemoglobin level 10.1 g per deciliter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were performed.\nDr. Pourvaziri: Transabdominal ultrasonography with Doppler analysis revealed a heterogeneous mass, measuring 16.6 cm by 15.6 cm by 9.9 cm, that was inseparable from the right ovary with the use of probe pressure maneuvers. The mass had normal vascular flow and areas of increased echogenicity. The left ovary was normal, and there was a moderate-to-large amount of free fluid in the pelvis.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed a heterogeneously attenuating mass, measuring 17.8 cm by 13.6 cm by 8.6 cm, that displaced the bowel and pelvic viscera. The mass had prominent amorphous, peripherally enhancing components and internal vasculature. The right ovary was not definitively identified separately. There was a large amount of ascitic fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis (Figure 1), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, also showed a heterogeneous mass with thick, nodular, peripheral enhancement that appeared to originate from the right adnexa. The endometrial lining appeared thickened, measuring up to 22 mm in thickness.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Connolly: The patient was admitted to the hospital.

    "user_input": "Dr. Grace R. Bobkowski (Medicine): A 50-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of confusion.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 months before the current presentation, when dysphagia developed. One month later, she was evaluated by her primary care physician. She reported having a sensation that pills and food were getting stuck in her throat when she swallowed. She was unable to take her medications, and her food intake had decreased to two eggs per day. She estimated that her weight had decreased by 5 kg during the previous month. She was referred for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which reportedly revealed ulceration of the gastrojejunal junction from a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass performed 12 years earlier but otherwise normal mucosa. Examination of biopsy specimens obtained during the procedure reportedly revealed findings consistent with lymphocytic esophagitis. Treatment with swallowed fluticasone was recommended.\nThree months before the current presentation, leg swelling developed, and the patient was again evaluated by her primary care physician. She had stopped using fluticasone after 1 week of treatment because she had not noticed any decrease in the dysphagia. Her weight had decreased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month earlier. Pitting edema was present in the legs. A diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency was considered, and compression stockings were recommended.\nTwo months before the current presentation, leg swelling worsened, arm swelling developed, and the patient had trouble performing activities of daily living. She was admitted to another hospital. She reported persistent dysphagia and reduced food intake. Her weight had increased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month earlier. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The blood albumin level was 2.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.5 to 4.8), and the zinc level was 0.36 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 0.66 to 1.10). Blood levels of vitamin B2, vitamin B12, folate, and methylmalonate were normal; the blood level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide was normal for the patient\u2019s age. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The albumin:creatinine ratio in a random urine sample was 11.6 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine (reference value, <30.0).

Pitting edema of the arms and legs was attributed to hypoalbuminemia from limited oral intake, which was related to dysphagia from untreated lymphocytic esophagitis. The use of fluticasone was encouraged, and supplemental nutritional drinks were recommended, along with a multivitamin and zinc sulfate. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was discharged home.\nOne month before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to this hospital because of confusion and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Escherichia coli. Confusion resolved with treatment of the UTI. Her weight had decreased by 2 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. The patient reported loose stools without blood or mucus, which had occurred for 1 month. Edema was present. The blood albumin level was 1.7 g per deciliter, the zinc level 0.3 \u03bcg per milliliter, the selenium level 34 ng per milliliter (reference range, 70 to 150), the vitamin A level 16.6 \u03bcg per deciliter (reference range, 32.5 to 78.0), and the vitamin C level 0.2 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.4 to 2.0). Blood levels of vitamin B1 and vitamin B3 were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nEGD showed ulceration of the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. Biopsy specimens of the esophagus, stomach, and jejunum showed normal mucosa. A biopsy specimen of the gastrojejunal anastomosis showed small-intestinal mucosa with erosion and nonspecific morphologic features; periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining was negative for microorganisms, Congo red staining was negative for amyloid, and immunohistochemical staining was negative for cytomegalovirus. Magnetic resonance enterography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of active inflammatory bowel disease. A high-protein diet was recommended, along with a multivitamin, zinc sulfate, and selenium. On the eighth hospital day, the patient was discharged home.\nAfter discharge, the patient initially felt well. The edema abated, and her appetite improved. She began to have six small meals and three protein shakes per day. Two weeks after discharge, and 1 week before the current presentation, confusion developed, and the gait became unsteady; she began using a walker for ambulation. During the next week, confusion increased, and she fell while walking. Her family brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, she was unable to answer questions about her history. Her family reported that she had had slowed and slurred speech for the past week and increasing difficulty with attention, including difficulty with holding a conversation. Other medical history included chronic back pain, bipolar disorder, seizure disorder, and ulcerative colitis. Medications included carbamazepine, ergocalciferol, fluticasone, gabapentin, mesalamine, methocarbamol, mirtazapine, a multivitamin, olanzapine, omeprazole, oxycodone\u2013acetaminophen, selenium, sucralfate, thiamine, topiramate, and zinc sulfate. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was receiving disability benefits and did not work because of chronic back pain. She had smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 35 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had endometrial cancer, and her father had lung cancer.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 89/52 mm Hg, the pulse 132 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.9. Her weight had decreased by 6 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. She appeared chronically ill and was lethargic but arose in response to voice. She moved her arms and legs but did not participate in a detailed neurologic examination. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The white-cell count was 17,150 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with neutrophil predominance. The blood zinc level was 0.35 \u03bcg per milliliter, the copper level 0.28 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 0.75 to 1.45), and the vitamin B6 level less than 2 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50). Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and 50 to 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nA chest radiograph was normal, without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Urine, blood, and stool specimens were obtained for culture. Three liters of intravenous lactated Ringer\u2019s solution were administered, and the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Three hours after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, she became more lethargic and had no response to voice; she reacted to being shaken but did not open her eyes or answer questions. Additional imaging studies were performed.\nDr. Theodore T. Pierce: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed no abnormalities. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse hepatic steatosis, as well as mucosal hyperenhancement and submucosal edema involving portions of the small and large bowel, with relative sparing of the distal jejunum, proximal ileum, descending colon, and sigmoid colon.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Abdomen and Pelvis.\nDr. Bobkowski: Treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was initiated. Six hours after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, the blood pressure decreased to 85/45 mm Hg, and the heart rate increased to 132 beats per minute. There was no response to painful stimuli. Myoclonic jerking movements were observed. Treatment with norepinephrine was initiated, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The trachea was intubated for airway protection, and sedation with propofol and dexmedetomidine was initiated. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was continued; prescribed medications of carbamazepine, a multivitamin, omeprazole, selenium, sucralfate, thiamine, topiramate, and zinc sulfate were administered.\nOn the first hospital day, the blood pressure increased, and vasopressors and sedative medications were discontinued. The patient had no spontaneous interaction or speech production. She did not follow commands or grimace in response to noxious stimuli. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The corneal reflexes were intact, as were the cough and gag reflexes. There was no spontaneous movement of the arms or legs, but they withdrew in response to pain; the deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The results of CT of the head were normal. Sedation was not resumed, and serial neurologic examinations were performed.\nOn the second hospital day, leukocytosis had resolved, but the patient\u2019s mental status had not improved. Electroencephalography (EEG) with long-term monitoring revealed near-continuous generalized periodic discharges with triphasic morphologic features, often with superimposed rhythmic activity. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head were normal, as were the results of magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck. Lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed normal protein levels and no nucleated cells. The urine culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. The blood and stool cultures were negative, as was a stool test for Clostridioides difficile and an examination of the stool for ova and parasites. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was stopped, and treatment with ciprofloxacin was started.\nOn the third hospital day, the patient\u2019s mental status had not improved. EGD showed a small scar at the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. The results of flexible sigmoidoscopy were normal. Biopsy specimens of the jejunum and descending colon showed normal mucosa.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. P. Connor Johnson (Medicine): A 39-year-old woman presented to this hospital with fever, flank pain, and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 4 weeks before admission, when she noted tender bilateral inguinal swelling. Two days later, she began to have sharp, intermittent flank pain on the right side; she rated the pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. During the next 3 days, she had nausea and a poor appetite. She noted foul-smelling urine but had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or hematuria.\nThree weeks before admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, and she appeared well. There was costovertebral and abdominal tenderness on the right side, without rebound or guarding. The external genitalia were normal. Copious thin, white vaginal discharge was present; no cervical motion tenderness was noted, and the ovaries were normal on palpation. Multiple bilateral tender inguinal lymph nodes, measuring up to 2 cm in diameter, were noted on palpation. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. On microscopic examination of the vaginal discharge, clue cells were observed, but there were no fungal elements or trichomonads. Nucleic acid amplification tests of a cervical swab for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were negative. A blood test for IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies to C. trachomatis serovars L1 and D through K was negative. Urinalysis revealed leukocyte esterase and nitrates; urine was obtained for culture. Vaginal metronidazole gel was prescribed.\nTwo days later, the urine culture grew more than 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU) of Escherichia coli per milliliter and 10,000 to 100,000 CFU of Klebsiella pneumoniae per milliliter. A 14-day course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was prescribed.\nThe inguinal swelling reportedly abated, but the flank pain and nausea persisted. Two days after the patient completed the prescribed course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, fever and night sweats developed. After 3 days of fever with a temperature of up to 38.5\u00b0C, she began vomiting and subsequently presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing flank pain, malaise, nausea, and poor appetite with weight loss of 2.3 kg during the past month. There was no sore throat, cough, or diarrhea. She had a history of hypothyroidism, asthma, bipolar disorder, dysmenorrhea, and migraines. She had had multiple urinary tract infections; pyelonephritis had been diagnosed 4 years before this presentation. A copper intrauterine device had been inserted 6 months before this presentation. Medications included albuterol, budesonide\u2013formoterol, divalproex, levothyroxine, loratadine, and sumatriptan as needed for migraines. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had immigrated to the United States from Brazil 1 year earlier; she had been living in New England during the past year and had been working in a laboratory. She had recently spent 3 months in Brazil visiting her husband and had returned to New England shortly before she noted inguinal swelling. While in Brazil, she had remained in a large city and had not visited any remote locations. In New England, she lived alone with one kitten and one full-grown cat. There was no family history of cancer. An aunt had died from tuberculosis, but the patient had had only minimal contact with her aunt.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 67.5 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.4. The patient appeared ill. The right side of the abdomen was tender on palpation, without rebound or guarding. Hepatosplenomegaly was not present. Tender bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were noted. No palpable cervical, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy was noted. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative, as was an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

    "user_input": "Dr. Carrie Chui (Neurology): A 79-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of involuntary movements on the left side and transient unresponsiveness.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before admission, when involuntary movements of the left shoulder and left side of the face developed. The movements were described by the patient as twitching, were not associated with a change in the level of consciousness, and resolved after 1 to 2 minutes. During the next 6 months, the patient had similar episodes approximately once per month, but the episodes increased in duration, lasting 5 to 6 minutes.\nThree months before admission, the episodes of involuntary movements increased in frequency, and the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The physical examination was normal. Results of kidney-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose and electrolytes, except for the sodium level, which was 129 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). There was a history of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and the sodium level was similar to levels obtained during the past 4 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a focus of enhancement in the right middle frontal gyrus that was thought to be a small vascular anomaly. Electroencephalography (EEG), performed with the patient in awake and drowsy states, revealed rare, brief, focal slowing in the left temporal lobe during drowsiness; no epileptiform abnormalities were present.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head and CT Angiogram of the Head and Neck.\nTwo months before admission, the patient was evaluated in the epilepsy clinic affiliated with this hospital. He reported that the episodes of involuntary movements had increased in both frequency and duration, occurring once or twice per day and lasting approximately 10 minutes. Episodes began with tingling and numbness in the left leg that prompted the patient to voluntarily stomp the left foot to relieve the uncomfortable sensation. Then, the patient had involuntary movements that he described as an uncontrollable invisible force moving the left leg and arm, with hyperextension of the arm backward and pronation of the wrist. There was associated numbness in the distal portions of the left third, fourth, and fifth fingers and involuntary movement of the left cheek. No prodromal symptoms occurred. The patient had awareness during the episodes, and after the episodes, he felt fatigued but had a normal level of consciousness, without confusion. The examination in the epilepsy clinic was normal. A diagnosis of seizure disorder was considered, and treatment with levetiracetam was started.\nThree weeks before admission, the patient was again evaluated in the epilepsy clinic. He reported that the episodes of involuntary movements still occurred on a daily basis but had decreased in duration and involved only the left leg, without abnormal movements of the arm or face. Dizziness, headache, and weakness had developed and were attributed to the use of levetiracetam. The patient\u2019s family had recorded a video of one of the episodes of involuntary movements. After reviewing the video, the patient\u2019s neurologist thought that the episodes were less likely to be caused by seizures and more consistent with choreoathetoid movements. Cross-tapering of medications \u2014 with the simultaneous administration of levetiracetam in decreasing doses and clobazam in increasing doses \u2014 was initiated, and the patient was referred to the movement disorders clinic affiliated with this hospital.\nOn the morning of admission, an episode of involuntary movements of the left leg and left shoulder occurred and persisted for 1 hour. Several hours after the symptoms abated, the patient\u2019s wife found the patient to be unresponsive; he was sitting in a chair. Emergency medical services were called, and when they arrived, the patient was responsive. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 180 mg per deciliter (10.0 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported dysuria and increased urinary frequency. The patient\u2019s daughter noted that he had been more anxious during the past 3 years and occasionally had trouble with memory. Other medical history included Barrett\u2019s esophagus, benign prostatic hypertrophy, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, eczema, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and osteoporosis. There was no history of head trauma or extended loss of consciousness. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, doxazosin, finasteride, omeprazole, metoprolol, sacubitril, and valsartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol rarely; he did not use illicit drugs. His mother had had gastric cancer, and his sister had had esophageal cancer; there was no family history of seizures.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 152/97 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.7. The blood pressure decreased to 130/63 mm Hg with standing. The patient was alert and interactive. The lower jaw was held to the left, but the nasolabial folds and smile were symmetric with activation. There were nonrhythmic, nonstereotyped, writhing movements of the left arm. Tone was normal, and strength was assessed as 5 out of 5 in the arms and legs. Results of liver-function and kidney-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose and electrolytes, except for the sodium level, which was 125 mmol per liter. The lactate level was 2.1 mmol per liter (19 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]). The urinalysis was normal. Intravenous fluids were administered. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Rajiv Gupta: Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1B) revealed extensively calcified plaque with severe stenosis of the distal right common carotid artery (CCA), extending into the proximal right internal carotid artery (ICA), as well as stenosis of the right and left paraclinoid ICAs and the left vertebral artery at its origin. There was no vascular abnormality on the CT angiogram that corresponded to the abnormality in the right middle frontal gyrus seen on the previous MRI.\nDr. Chui: The patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the sodium level had increased to 130 mmol per liter, and the lactate level was normal. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Gupta: MRI of the head showed no evidence of acute infarction. The focus of enhancement in the right frontal lobe that had been noted previously was not seen on the current MRI.\nDr. Chui: Blood levels of thyrotropin, cobalamin, and glycated hemoglobin and results of coagulation tests were normal. Screening tests for Lyme disease, tuberculosis, and syphilis were negative, as were tests for antibodies to cardiolipin and \u03b22-glycoprotein. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive, at a titer of 1:160 in a homogeneous pattern. During a physical therapy session, the patient had abnormal movements of the left leg, left arm, and left side of the face. The abnormal movements diminished when the patient used distraction techniques, such as thigh tapping, finger snapping, and walking while holding a glass of water.\nThe transient unresponsiveness that led to the patient\u2019s admission was attributed to a combination of sedation from clobazam and hypovolemia. Treatment with clobazam was stopped, and hydration was encouraged. A diagnosis of functional neurologic disorder was considered; outpatient physical therapy with continued use of distraction techniques was recommended. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day.\nEpisodes of involuntary movements continued to occur on a daily basis at home. Two weeks after discharge, when the patient was doing exercises while sitting in a chair and having a conversation with his wife, he suddenly stopped talking. She found him slumped in the chair with his eyes closed, no longer exercising. When she asked him questions, he repeatedly said \u201cyes.\u201d Emergency medical services were called, and when they arrived, the patient was alert, diaphoretic, and nonverbal. He had a facial droop on the left side and a right gaze preference. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 130 mg per deciliter (7.2 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 143/63 mm Hg, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and interactive. There was a facial droop on the left side. There was no effort against gravity in the left arm. The patient was able to lift the left leg off the bed for 1 to 2 seconds. He had a right gaze deviation that could not be overcome and mild dysarthria. The remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of stroke was considered, and emergency CT angiography was performed.\nDr. Gupta: CT angiography showed no evidence of acute territorial infarction and no changes in cerebrovascular disease.\nDr. Chui: On repeat physical examination performed after CT angiography, the gaze deviation and dysarthria had resolved, and strength was normal. Mild facial paralysis was present.\nA diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Jacquelyn M. Nestor (Medicine): A 41-year-old woman with transient dysarthria and facial droop was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of masses on the mitral valve.\nThree weeks before this presentation, the patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital because of concerns about heavy vaginal bleeding that had developed 1 week earlier and was associated with crampy abdominal pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and lightheadedness. Examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/79 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 100% while she was breathing ambient air; the examination was otherwise reportedly normal, although a gynecologic examination was not performed. Laboratory results were notable for a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0; previous level 1 year earlier, 9.1), a mean corpuscular volume of 71.3 fl (reference range, 80 to 94), and a platelet count of 148,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Normal saline was administered intravenously, and a 5-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed.\nEleven days after the patient completed the therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate (9 days before this presentation), heavy vaginal bleeding and dyspnea recurred. An additional 3-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed. The evening after the patient finished the second course of treatment, within 1 hour after she had been seen and had appeared to be well, her husband noted that she had facial droop on the right side and slurred speech; he called emergency medical services. When she arrived at the emergency department of a second hospital, within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms, her examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 173/83 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 99% while she was breathing ambient air. She was noted to have facial droop on the right side and unintelligible speech.\nDr. Sandra P. Rincon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Figure 1A) revealed no evidence of acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage. Small chronic infarcts were seen in the right thalamus and right cerebellar hemisphere. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck did not show high-grade stenosis or large-vessel occlusion.\nFIGURE 1\n\nNeuroimaging Studies.\nDr. Nestor: A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. Blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the white-cell count and differential count and the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable, and urinalysis showed 3+ blood, no protein, and no casts. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Within 45 minutes after the patient arrived at the emergency department of the second hospital, the facial asymmetry and dysarthria resolved.

There was no evidence of an acute infarction (Figure 1D), intracranial hemorrhage, or cerebrovascular occlusion (Figure 1E and 1F).\nDr. Nestor: Two units of packed red cells were transfused. Post-transfusion laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 2A and 2B and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) showed thickened mitral valve leaflets and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg.\nFIGURE 2\n\nEchocardiograms and CT Scans of the Abdomen and Pelvis.\nDr. Evin Yucel: On the third hospital day, a transesophageal echocardiogram (Figure 2C and Videos 2 and 3) showed multiple echodensities on the atrial side of the mitral valve leaflets at the closure lines that were consistent with vegetations. Cultures of blood were obtained, and heparin was administered intravenously.\nDr. Nestor: On the fourth hospital day, the rate of heparin infusion was decreased at 6-hour intervals when the partial-thromboplastin time exceeded 150 seconds, until the infusion was stopped. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1; complement levels (C3 and C4) were normal. Additional cultures of blood were obtained.\nDr. Rincon: Repeat CT of the head revealed no acute abnormality. CT of the chest showed clustered nodules in the lower lobes that were probably related to aspiration, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2D, 2E, and 2F) revealed an enlarged heterogeneous uterus with multiple fibroids.\nDr. Nestor: The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On a review of systems, she reported no recurrence of dysarthria or facial droop and noted no other neurologic symptoms. She reported that she had had heavy menstrual bleeding and exertional dyspnea in the weeks preceding this presentation; pruritic, macular rashes on the trunk, scalp, arms, and legs with associated photosensitivity that had persisted for many weeks; new Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon in the past 10 months; and a long history of dry eyes and seasonal allergies. Medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, vitamin B12 deficiency, iron deficiency resulting in past iron infusions, uterine fibroids, anxiety, and hypertension. Surgical history included multiple laparoscopies and two laparotomies, including salpingo-oophorectomy for endometriosis. Owing to infertility, she had undergone in vitro fertilization; she had a first-trimester spontaneous abortion at 25 years of age. During her second pregnancy at 33 years of age, a screening rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was positive at 1:8; however, a treponemal-specific confirmatory test for syphilis was negative. Pregnancy-induced hypertension developed, followed by placental abruption at 30 weeks, which resulted in a cesarean delivery. Medications included amlodipine, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, and medroxyprogesterone acetate. She had no known medication allergies.\nThe patient lived in eastern Massachusetts with her husband and child. She did not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. Her mother had rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and a history of spontaneous abortion. One grandmother had diabetes and the other grandmother had had a stroke. An aunt had had leukemia and later breast cancer. Her child has psoriasis.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 155/98 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 175 cm, the weight 107 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 34.9. There were several small, circular macules on her back (Figure 3). There was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex. She had no lymphadenopathy, petechiae, nail changes, or evidence of arthritis. The remainder of the examination was normal, as was a neurologic examination.\nFIGURE 3\n\nClinical Photograph of Macules on the Back.\nLaboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Madhavan: A 30-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital for the third time in 4 weeks because of recurrent fever.\nThe patient had been well until 4 weeks before the current presentation, when fever, dry cough, nasal congestion, and decreased intake of solid foods developed. The next day, while he was playing in a park with his siblings, he began limping. No trauma had preceded the onset of limping. The patient\u2019s parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nThe patient was afebrile. He was interactive but appeared tired and walked with a limp, favoring the left leg. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The white-cell count was 28,440 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 63 mm per hour (reference range, 9 to 14), and the C-reactive protein level 31.3 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0). Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for culture, and imaging studies were obtained.\nTable 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nDr. Evan J.

On the second hospital day, he remained afebrile, had a normal energy level, and was walking normally. Blood cultures showed no growth. He was discharged home.\nTwo days after discharge, fever recurred. The patient\u2019s mother brought him back to emergency department of this hospital. The patient was afebrile, but leukocytosis and elevated levels of inflammatory markers persisted. Tests of a nasopharyngeal swab were positive for coronavirus (not severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and for human rhinovirus and enterovirus. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was again obtained for culture, and additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Zucker: Ultrasonography of the abdomen (Figure 1B) revealed multiple hypoechoic splenic lesions, measuring up to 6 mm in diameter. No cholelithiasis, thickening of the gallbladder wall, or biliary ductal dilatation was present. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1C), abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, was notable for mediastinal lymphadenopathy mostly involving the paratracheal and subcarinal lymph node stations, as well as right hilar lymphadenopathy.\nDr. Madhavan: The patient was readmitted to the hospital. During the next 3 days, he had intermittent fever, which abated after the administration of ibuprofen. Blood cultures showed no growth. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was discharged home with recommendations for continued supportive care and instructions to undergo additional laboratory testing and imaging studies.\nDuring the subsequent 3 weeks, the patient continued to have intermittent fever. On the day of the current presentation, planned outpatient laboratory testing was performed. The white-cell count was 42,390 per microliter, and the patient\u2019s mother was asked to bring him back to the emergency department for evaluation.\nThe patient\u2019s mother reported that the patient had fever once or twice daily. The episodes of fever were associated with chills, and the patient seemed averse to being held or touched. When he had no fever, he was playful and behaved normally. He had persistent dry cough, nasal congestion, and decreased intake of solid foods. There was no vomiting, diarrhea, or blood or mucus in the stool.\nThe patient had had normal growth and had met normal developmental milestones. He had iron-deficiency anemia. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies. Immunizations were up to date. His parents had immigrated to the United States from Central America. The patient and his siblings had been born in the United States, lived in a suburban area of New England, and had not traveled outside the region. His parents and older sister were healthy. One older brother had developmental delay and sensorineural hearing loss of unknown cause. Three and a half years before the patient\u2019s current presentation, another older brother had received a diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection at 31 months of age.\nOn examination, the axillary temperature was 40.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/61 mm Hg, the pulse 180 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 55 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was crying but consolable. Breathing was normal, without grunting or intercostal retractions, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There was palpable right axillary lymphadenopathy; he resisted examination of the left axilla. No cervical or inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted. No focal tenderness on palpation of the arms, legs, or joints was present, and there was no rash.\nDr. Zucker: Radiography of the chest revealed an opacity in the right lower lobe. Subsequent CT of the chest, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 1D), revealed multifocal pulmonary opacities with a basilar predominance in both lungs, along with lymphadenopathy that was relatively unchanged from that observed on previous CT imaging.\nDr. Madhavan: Administration of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula was initiated at a rate of 1 liter per minute.

The sickle cell disease had been complicated by vaso-occlusive events with pain severe enough to lead to hospitalization 3 or 4 times per year. He also had a history of osteonecrosis of the hips that had led to treatment with total hip arthroplasty of both hips 3 years before the current presentation.\nSeven days before the current presentation, the patient presented to this hospital with pain in the low back, hips, and legs, which had developed 1 day after he had carried boxes up several flights of stairs.

Joseph Simeone: Posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the chest (Figure 1A) showed normal lungs and a normal cardiac silhouette; superior and inferior end-plate depressions in midthoracic vertebral bodies were noted. Frontal and lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine (Figure 1B) showed superior and inferior end-plate depressions at multiple vertebral levels and diffuse bony sclerosis, findings consistent with bony changes from sickle cell disease. An anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis (Figure 1C) showed evidence of total hip arthroplasty; the findings had not changed from those observed on recently obtained radiographs.\nFIGURE 1\n\nRadiographs of the Chest, Spine, and Pelvis Obtained 7 Days before the Current Admission.\nDr. Sallah: A diagnosis of a painful vaso-occlusive event was made, and treatment included intravenous fluids, ketorolac, and hydromorphone. Musculoskeletal strain was considered to be a contributing factor for the pain, given the recent strenuous activity. The pain slowly abated, and on hospital day 5, the patient was discharged home.\nOne day after discharge, and 2 days before the current presentation, pain in the right hip developed while the patient was at rest. Despite treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen, the hip pain worsened, and the patient was unable to walk. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported pain in the right hip that felt different in quality from the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. He also reported pleuritic chest pain that felt similar in quality to the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. The tympanic temperature measured at home was 37.8\u00b0C.\nDuring the 6 months before the current presentation, vaso-occlusive events had increased in frequency and severity. There had been three hospital admissions with a duration of 4 to 8 days, including one admission for acute chest syndrome. The pain associated with vaso-occlusive events typically involved the chest, arms, or thighs. There was a history of automated red-cell exchange, which had been performed before total hip arthroplasty; there was also a history of four blood transfusions. Other history included tinnitus, symmetric high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, and cholelithiasis. Medications included voxelotor and folic acid, as well as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and hydromorphone as needed for pain. The patient had no known allergies. He lived in a suburb of Boston and worked as an engineer. He had traveled to West Africa 1 year before the current presentation and to South Asia 3 weeks before the current presentation. He drank alcohol occasionally, had never smoked tobacco, and did not use illicit drugs. Both of his parents and his brother had sickle cell trait.\nThe temporal temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 121/56 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. He had mild tenderness on palpation of the right hip but no obvious deformity; there was a well-healed incision without overlying erythema. He was able to fully extend and flex the right hip, but such movement caused mild discomfort. There was moderate discomfort with the log-roll test (rolling the thigh internally and externally with the patient in the supine position). The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 15,680 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the hemoglobin level 7.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the platelet count 581,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The blood C-reactive protein level was 100.6 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 113 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 14). Nucleic acid amplification testing for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

    "user_input": "Dr. Mollie Sands (Medicine): A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypoglycemia.\nThe patient had been well until 3 hours before this admission, when altered mental status developed while he was at work. During a meeting, his colleagues noticed that he was not paying attention or participating in the conversation, which was atypical of the patient. Instead, he was fidgeting and mumbling as though talking to another person. When his mobile telephone rang, he allowed it to continue ringing.\nTwo hours before this admission, the patient was found by colleagues on the floor of a conference room. His eyes were open, but he was obtunded and making nonpurposeful movements. Emergency medical services were called. On evaluation, a fingerstick glucose measurement was 39 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 109 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Intravenous dextrose was administered, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the patient was obtunded and did not react to sternal rub. Additional intravenous dextrose was administered, and a dextrose infusion was started. The patient\u2019s mental status improved, and he was able to provide additional history. That morning, he had felt that he was in a \u201cdreamlike\u201d state; there were no other symptoms. The altered mental status had resolved, but he could not recall most events of the morning, including the meeting that had taken place 3 hours before admission.\nReview of symptoms was notable for unintentional weight gain of one pant size during the past 3 months, as well as intermittent morning dizziness during the past 3 years, which would resolve after the patient ate candy or breakfast. He reported no recent illness, depression, anxiety, change in activity or exercise, or change in intake of food or drink. On a typical day, he had breakfast at 5 a.m., a second breakfast at 10 a.m., lunch at 1 p.m., dinner at 6 p.m., and a snack at 8 p.m. The patient had last eaten approximately 7 hours before presentation to the emergency department.\nTwo years earlier, the patient had had an episode of drooping and decreased sensation of the left side of the face and difficulty enunciating words, which occurred while he was at work. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital. The blood glucose level was 64 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter), and testing for Lyme disease was negative. He received a diagnosis of Bell\u2019s palsy and was treated with prednisone and acyclovir; the symptoms resolved. Two months later, the patient established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. Routine laboratory testing revealed a blood glucose level of 46 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter).\nThe patient took vitamin B12 and vitamin D supplements. He took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Sixteen years earlier, he had immigrated to the United States from Southeast Asia and now lived alone in an urban area of New England. He worked as a registered nurse. His father and brother had type 2 diabetes and used insulin.\nOn examination, the temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 82 beats per minute, the blood pressure 146/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.6. The patient appeared well. He had no hepatosplenomegaly or skin hyperpigmentation, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the blood glucose level was 36 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter); after the administration of dextrose, a fingerstick glucose measurement was 158 mg per deciliter (8.8 mmol per liter). The complete blood count and blood electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The glycated hemoglobin level was 5.4% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

    "user_input": "Dr. Neelam A. Phadke: A 54-year-old woman with a history of episodic swelling of the arms, hands, and feet was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\nTwenty-three years before the current presentation, swelling of the left hand developed after the patient sustained a human bite. The swelling was associated with mild pruritus, erythema, and warmth. The swelling was well demarcated, involved only the left hand, and resolved after 3 days without specific treatment.\nTwenty-two years before the current presentation, the patient had epigastric pain that radiated to her back, with associated nausea. Results of an upper gastrointestinal series, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were reportedly normal. The abdominal pain resolved, but two similar self-limited episodes occurred during the next year. No cause for the abdominal pain was identified.\nDuring the next 3 years, episodes of self-limited swelling occurred once per year; one episode involved the right foot, one the left hand, and one the right hand. There were no clear triggers for the episodes, although they tended to occur after exposure to cold or after minor trauma, such as scratching.\nEighteen years before the current presentation, episodes of swelling of the hands and feet began to occur on a monthly basis, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital after an episode of swelling of the left hand. A skin-biopsy specimen reportedly showed sparse superficial dermal perivascular and interstitial mixed inflammatory infiltrate and stromal edema. Treatment with prednisone was initiated. The swelling of the left hand resolved after 3 days, and the patient was referred to the allergy clinic of this hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency was made on the basis of low levels of C1 esterase inhibitor, C4, and C1q. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal, and tests for antinuclear antibodies were negative. The patient was evaluated in the allergy clinic of a third hospital, and treatment with daily danazol was initiated. The episodes of swelling of the hands and feet resolved.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (This Hospital, 18 Yr before the Current Presentation), 18 Yr before the Current Presentation (This Hospital), Reference Range (Third Hospital, 10 Yr before the Current Presentation), 10 Yr before the Current Presentation (Third Hospital)\n\nTotal complement (U/ml), 63\u2013145, 129, 150\u2013250, 149\nC3 (mg/dl), 86\u2013184, 159, 90\u2013180, 152\nC4 (mg/dl), 20\u201358, <10, 10\u201340, 8\nC2 (mg/dl), 1.58\u20133.92, 2.45, 1.58\u20133.92, 1.6\nC1 inhibitor level (mg/dl), 12.4\u201324.5, 2.4, 21\u201339, 7\nC1 inhibitor function, Present, Present, Present, Present\nC1q (mg/dl), 8\u201312, 6.9, 8\u201312, 7\n\nTen years before the current presentation, episodes of swelling of the eyelids and upper lip occurred with associated pruritus. The episodes began with a sensation of facial flushing, pruritus of the scalp, and a raised pruritic rash on the face and chest; at times, these episodes were accompanied by shortness of breath, chest tightness, itchy throat, and red eyes. The patient was evaluated in the allergy clinic of the third hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The dose of danazol was increased, and the patient was instructed to take hydroxyzine as needed during episodes of swelling that were associated with pruritus.\nThe swelling episodes associated with pruritus occurred with variable frequency (several times per week to once every few months) but resolved within 30 minutes after the administration of hydroxyzine. Cetirizine was substituted for hydroxyzine for acute episodes. Treatment with daily loratadine and ranitidine was initiated, and the episodes of swelling with pruritus decreased in frequency.\nFour months before the current presentation, swelling of the right arm developed after venipuncture. There was no associated pruritus. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. Ultrasonography of the arm showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and the patient was discharged from the emergency department. The swelling resolved after 3 days.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed. The patient attributed her symptoms to food poisoning, since her daughter had similar symptoms; the symptoms resolved after 3 days.\nOne week before the current presentation, epigastric pain developed; the pain was burning in character, worsened with consumption of food, and abated with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient was evaluated at a fourth hospital, where CT of the abdomen reportedly revealed inflammation of the duodenum and jejunum. A proton-pump inhibitor was administered, and the abdominal pain decreased. The patient was instructed not to take NSAIDs and was discharged home. However, during the next week, abdominal pain recurred, along with new symptoms of poor appetite and early satiety. She presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further care.\nOther history included hypertension, low-back pain, and osteoporosis; she had undergone previous appendectomy and cesarean section. The patient also had a subepithelial duodenal mass, measuring 7 mm in diameter, that had been stable in size during the past 5 years; ultrasonographic images had shown that the mass was consistent with a benign stromal cell neoplasm. Medications included amlodipine, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, omeprazole, ranitidine, loratadine, and danazol, as well as cetirizine as needed. The patient had no known medication allergies but was allergic to iodinated contrast material. She was originally from Bangladesh and now lived with her husband and two children in a suburban community in New England and worked as a teacher. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension. The patient reported no similar episodes of swelling in either of her parents.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 106/81 mm Hg, the pulse 74 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was mildly distended with normal bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness on palpation, without rebound or involuntary guarding. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of lipase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, troponin, and thyrotropin. The alanine aminotransferase level was 49 IU per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and the aspartate aminotransferase level was 52 IU per liter (reference range, 9 to 32).\nDr. Ravi Gottumukkala: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of oral or intravenous contrast material, revealed long-segment marked circumferential thickening of the jejunal wall with associated mesenteric edema and small-volume free intraperitoneal fluid.

    "user_input": "Dr. Kathleen M. McFadden (Medicine): An 84-year-old man was admitted to this hospital after having a fall.\nThree weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital because of a transient episode of gross hematuria. Urinalysis showed trace blood (reference value, negative), and microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed 4 or 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 3). Results of tests of coagulation were normal, and the complete blood count showed anemia, which had been diagnosed previously and was stable as compared with findings obtained 11 months earlier. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed a linear density in the bladder that measured 10 mm in diameter. The cause of the episode of hematuria was thought to be a kidney stone that had passed into the bladder. The patient was discharged home with a plan to follow up in the urology clinic affiliated with the other hospital; he was instructed to continue treatment with rivaroxaban, which he had been taking for many years to prevent stroke in the context of atrial fibrillation.\nOne week before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of the other hospital after he had expressive aphasia as well as numbness on the right side of his face and in his right arm, which had resolved before he arrived at the emergency department. He had missed multiple doses of rivaroxaban in the 2 weeks before the onset of these symptoms. CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly did not show evidence of stroke or clinically significant stenosis in the anterior or posterior cerebral circulation. The complete blood count showed that his anemia remained stable. The blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 1+ blood, and microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed 6 to 10 red cells per high-power field and 6 to 9 white cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2).\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Other Hospital), 1 Wk before Current Presentation (Other Hospital), Reference Range (This Hospital), On Presentation (This Hospital), Hospital Day 4\n\nHematocrit (%), 42.0\u201352.0, 35.2, 41.0\u201353.0, 31.8, 34.9\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 14.0\u201318.0, 11.1, 13.5\u201317.5, 10.5, 11.0\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201310,800, 4700, 4500\u201311,000, 9870, 8030\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 2000\u20137000, 2690, 1800\u20137700, 9270, 7040\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20133000, 1220, 1000\u20134800, 90, 880\nMonocytes, 200\u20131000, 480, 200\u20131200, 420, 910\nEosinophils, 0\u2013500, 200, 0\u2013900, 0, 10\nBasophils, 0\u2013100, 70, 0\u2013300, 90, 30\nBands, 0\u201390, 20, 0\u2013100, 70, 70\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 132,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 143,000, 210,000\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 6\u201319, 21, 8\u201325, 40, 20\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.4\u20131.2, 1.0, 0.60\u20131.50, 2.01, 1.24\n\nThe patient was admitted to the other hospital. On hospital day 2, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed moderate generalized atrophy and small-vessel ischemic changes. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%, increased estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and intact intraventricular and atrial septa. The patient was told that his symptoms were due to a transient ischemic attack, and he was discharged home with instructions to continue taking rivaroxaban and with a plan to follow up in the neurology clinic affiliated with the other hospital.\nOn the day of the current presentation, the patient fell in his bathroom at his home. Emergency medical services were called. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 130 mg per deciliter (7.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 100 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). The patient was not able to recall the events that led to the fall. He was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported that he had felt unwell after discharge from the other hospital, with symptoms including generalized weakness and dizziness. He had no abdominal pain, chest pain, or urinary symptoms. His wife reported that before the patient\u2019s admission to the other hospital, he had been completely independent, performing activities such as driving and grocery shopping. However, since his discharge from the other hospital, he had become progressively weaker and had required assistance with walking and dressing. The patient\u2019s wife also reported an area of redness on the patient\u2019s left arm where an intravenous catheter had been placed during admission to the other hospital.\nOther medical history included atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, hypertension, and prostate cancer that had been treated with radiotherapy. Medications included amlodipine, finasteride, furosemide, losartan, rivaroxaban, rosuvastatin, and venlafaxine. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs; he smoked one pack of cigarettes per day. He was retired and lived in Massachusetts with his wife.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 145/68 mm Hg, the pulse 61 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.4. The patient appeared ill with dry mucous membranes. The heart sounds were irregular. There was an area of erythema overlying the left antecubital fossa with mild induration but no fluctuance. He had an abrasion over the left knee. He was cooperative but confused and intermittently answered questions inappropriately; he occasionally stared off into space and did not respond to questions. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation. Urinalysis showed 3+ blood (reference value, negative) and 3+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative); microscopic evaluation of the urinary sediment revealed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2), more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10), and 1+ bacteria. The blood level of creatinine was 2.01 mg per deciliter (178 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and the blood level of high-sensitivity troponin T 68 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, were negative. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Brian B. Ghoshhajra: CT angiography of the head and cervical spine showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of an acute infarct and no acute fracture in the cervical spine. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also performed. A small pleural effusion was detected in the left lung (Figure 1A). Moderate-to-severe coronary-artery calcification with multichamber cardiomegaly was present, and calcifications were scattered throughout the thoracic aorta, which showed aneurysmal dilatation (Figure 1D). An indeterminate left adrenal nodule that measured 15 mm in diameter was detected, along with circumferential wall thickening in the urinary bladder and two stones in the urinary bladder that measured up to 5 mm in diameter; seeds from previous brachytherapy were also visible (Figure 1C). Two focal areas of hyperdensity, each measuring up to 6 mm in diameter, that were seen along the posterior aspect of the spinal canal at the level of the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae were most likely meningiomas (Figure 1A and 1B). There was a focal outpouching of the aorta superior to the origin of the celiac artery and mural thickening of the aorta at the level of the aortic hiatus with adjacent fat stranding (Figure 1D).\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial CT Angiogram of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.\nDr. McFadden: While the patient was in the emergency department, the high-sensitivity troponin T levels, which were checked 1 and 3 hours after the initial troponin measurement, were 71 ng per liter and 70 ng per liter, respectively. A bolus of 500 ml of normal saline was administered. A presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection was made, and urine was obtained for culture. Treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with furosemide and losartan was stopped, but his other home medications were continued.\nOn hospital day 1, the urine culture grew more than 100,000 colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus. MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was degraded by motion artifact, but there was no evidence of an acute infarct. A TTE showed an LVEF of 60%, a dilated right ventricle with normal systolic function, mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and an elevated estimated right ventricular systolic pressure. Blood was obtained for culture, and treatment with ceftriaxone was continued.\nOn hospital day 2, the patient remained afebrile. An ultrasound image of the left antecubital fossa showed an avascular hypoechoic collection, measuring 1.7 cm by 0.5 cm by 1.3 cm, overlying a partially occluded superficial vein. The patient was evaluated by the orthopedic surgery consultant; no surgical intervention was recommended. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the urine culture isolate revealed methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Treatment with ceftriaxone was stopped, and treatment with intravenous vancomycin and cefazolin was initiated. Blood cultures obtained on hospital day 1 grew gram-positive cocci in clusters in one of four bottles. Additional blood cultures were obtained.\nOn hospital day 3, the patient had sudden chest pain while resting in bed. The pain was located over the left third intercostal space and did not radiate; the patient rated the pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain lasted 5 minutes and resolved without intervention. On evaluation by the treating physician immediately after the pain resolved, the blood pressure was 193/80 mm Hg. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes. A chest radiograph showed a small left pleural effusion similar to that previously seen on CT angiography and a confluent retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe. The blood level of high-sensitivity troponin T was 46 ng per liter. Treatment with losartan, which had been stopped on admission to the hospital, was restarted. During the next 12 hours, the blood pressure decreased to 167/81 mm Hg.\nOn hospital day 4, the patient had chest pain that was different in character from the pain he had had the previous day. The pain, which he rated at 10, radiated into the abdomen. The patient appeared distressed. The blood pressure was 173/85 mm Hg. The pain was unchanged on palpation over the chest and abdomen. Treatment with low-dose intravenous hydromorphone was initiated, and the pain decreased to 5 out of 10. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nA diagnostic test was performed, and management decisions were made.",

Miller (Medicine): A 64-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in early winter with fever and pancytopenia.\nThe patient, who had multiple sclerosis, had been in her usual state of health until 7 months before admission, when nausea and fatigue developed. Over the next 2 months, these symptoms worsened, and in the context of severe nausea, two episodes of vasovagal syncope occurred. During an evaluation for syncope, anemia was noted.

Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed cholelithiasis and splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 17 cm in the craniocaudal dimension (normal value, \u226412 cm).\nTwo and a half months before admission, the patient was evaluated in a hematology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She reported persistent nausea and fatigue, poor appetite with reduced oral intake, and 2 weeks of dyspnea on exertion. There was no orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The weight was 83.2 kg, and the spleen tip was palpable four fingerbreadths below the costal margin; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, and examination of the bone marrow specimen revealed mildly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and mild dyserythropoiesis.\nTreatment with prednisone and folic acid was begun. Ocrelizumab infusions for multiple sclerosis were stopped. Nausea and fatigue persisted, and fevers and sweats developed. After 3 weeks of treatment with prednisone, the anemia had not abated and the patient had temperatures as high as 39.0\u00b0C. Testing for influenza A and B viruses was negative. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The course of prednisone was tapered off over the next 18 days, and the patient was referred to a hematologist affiliated with this hospital.\nIn the hematology clinic, the patient reported that the fevers had resolved but the fatigue, weakness, and poor appetite had worsened. She felt too fatigued to walk, and she had recently had a fall without loss of consciousness. The weight was 82.4 kg; splenomegaly was present, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nIn addition to relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis, there was a history of trigeminal neuralgia, restless legs syndrome, vasovagal syncope when blood samples were obtained, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level for 1 year without a clear cause. Medications included oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, ropinirole, folic acid, and cholecalciferol. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had quit smoking 20 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her adult son and pet cat and dog. Her backyard adjoined a large wooded area where deer were often seen. She worked in health care administration. Her family history included diabetes in her mother, lung cancer in her father, and multiple sclerosis in her sister.\nOn examination, the patient appeared pale but not unwell. The temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 90/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 93 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.2. The conjunctivae were pale. The heart rate was regular, with normal first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) and a soft systolic murmur. There was edema in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis and coagulation tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was administered. Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered daily for 3 days, and the patient reported a decrease in weakness and fatigue.\nDr. Dexter P. Mendoza: On hospital day 4, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1A) revealed splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 19 cm in the craniocaudal dimension. Concurrent positron-emission tomography with injection of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (Figure 1B) revealed intense uptake in the spleen and diffuse uptake in the bone marrow throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Miller: On hospital day 5, the patient reported a recurrence of severe fatigue and generalized weakness. The temperature was 39.0\u00b0C and the heart rate 130 beats per minute. The results of physical examination were otherwise unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nA diagnostic test result was received.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Amy E. Armstrong-Javors: A 12-year-old boy with autism was admitted to this hospital because of decreased vision in both eyes.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 weeks before this admission, when he began to have difficulty seeing in both eyes. His vision was decreased when he woke up in the morning, improved throughout the day, and worsened again at night. Three weeks before the current admission, the patient told his parents about the vision changes. They took him to an optometry clinic for evaluation. Eyeglasses were not prescribed; a routine annual follow-up evaluation was scheduled.\nDuring the next 3 weeks, the patient noticed that the decrease in vision worsened. He typically walked on his toes and held onto his parents as he walked; however, 4 days before this admission, his parents noticed that he leaned on them heavily while walking. Two days before the current admission, they observed him walking into doors and walls and bumping into objects. On the day of this admission, the patient woke up screaming and panicked because he could not see. His parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported that his vision had improved slightly throughout the day. He described darkening of his vision that was worse in the left eye than in the right eye. He was having difficulty identifying movement and details of objects, although he was able to see shapes and colors. The parents reported that the patient had been having puffiness and crusting of the eyes for 2 days, with no eye redness or pain. Review of systems was notable for 3 days of diarrhea and nausea. He had no fever, headache, rashes, mouth sores, joint pain, or weakness.\nThe patient was born prematurely, at 7 months\u2019 gestation. Labor and delivery had taken place outside the hospital setting, and perinatal hypoxia had occurred. The patient had been taken urgently to another hospital, where he was resuscitated and then hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit for 2 months. The patient had autism and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He had developmental delays in speech, language, cognition, and fine motor skills. He had received all routine childhood vaccinations and was taking risperidone; there were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived with his parents and older sister, all of whom were healthy. Ten months before this admission, they had moved from an urban area to a rural area in New England. The patient was in sixth grade and was enrolled in special education classes at school. He had been an avid player of video and virtual reality games, but his parents had removed the gaming systems from their home 2 months before the patient\u2019s vision changes had begun. He continued to watch videos on the computer and television; his parents noted that he did not sit close to the devices and sometimes looked at the wall instead of the screen. The patient\u2019s parents described him as a \u201cpicky eater.\u201d His diet consisted almost exclusively of hamburgers, french fries, ranch dressing, glazed doughnuts, and juice boxes. The patient avoided trying new foods and did not take vitamin pills or gummies because he disliked the taste or texture.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 104/71 mm Hg, the heart rate 94 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 156 cm (70th percentile), the weight 40.3 kg (38th percentile), and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 16.6. The patient was pale, alert, interactive, and wary of the physical examination.\nDr. Ryan A. Gise: Mild periorbital swelling was present. The visual acuity in both eyes was limited to hand motion. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, and the extraocular movements were full. Color-vision testing, automated perimetry, fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography could not be performed because the patient had poor vision and was unable to cooperate. A slit-lamp examination was notable only for keratinization of the conjunctiva in both eyes. A funduscopic examination revealed pallor of the optic disk in both eyes. Examination of the peripheral retina was limited because the patient was unable to cooperate.\nDr. Armstrong-Javors: Strength, sensation, reflexes, and coordination were normal. A gait examination revealed toe walking; the patient asked for assistance when walking. The abdomen was nontender. Horizontal ridges were present on the toenails (Figure 1), and there were scattered bruises on the arms and legs. No ulcers or rashes were seen. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photograph of the Toenails.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range, On Admission\n\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201313,500, 5700\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.0\u201316.0, 12.3\nHematocrit (%), 37.0\u201349.0, 37.0\nMean corpuscular volume (g/dl), 78.0\u201398.0, 89.4\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 216,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 137\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 4.1\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 104\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 20\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 5\u201320, 6\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.38\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 77\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201340, 17\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 20\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 129\u2013417, 422\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 0.4\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 3.6\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.0\u20138.3, 5.9\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 17.1\nProthrombin-time international normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.4\n\nDr. Camilo Jaimes: During the next 2 days, imaging was attempted but limited because the patient was anxious about the testing. On the third hospital day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits, with and without the intravenous administration of contrast material, was successfully performed while the patient was under sedation (Figure 2). A fluid-sensitive short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence showed subtle hyperintensity of the mid-intraorbital segments of the optic nerves in both eyes, with no enhancement. The optic chiasm, optic tracts, and optic-nerve sheath complexes appeared normal. Diffuse heterogeneous thickening of the calvarium was present.\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head and Orbits.\nDr. Armstrong-Javors: Diagnostic tests were performed.",

Emergency medical services were activated and found the patient to be confused and aphasic; she could say only \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d There was no evidence of incontinence or trauma. A fingerstick blood glucose level was normal. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn the patient\u2019s arrival at the emergency department, limited additional information was obtained from coworkers and family members. The patient had had coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) 4 weeks earlier and had returned to work after 2 weeks. On the morning before this evaluation, coworkers had observed that she appeared \u201cunwell.\u201d Before 2 p.m., she had participated in a lunchtime conference call and had spoken to family members and colleagues. Her medical history was notable for hypertension, for which she took amlodipine.

On examination, she was aphasic; her speech was described as mumbling, and she was able to answer simple questions only intermittently. Strength and sensation appeared to be grossly intact, but she could not perform rapidly alternating movements or tests of coordination. There was no evidence of head or other trauma. The remainder of the examination was normal. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Shahmir Kamalian: Forty minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival, computed tomography (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, or intracranial or cervical arterial stenosis or occlusion.

    "user_input": "Dr. Austin Be (Surgery): A 14-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of swelling of the left jaw.\nThe patient had been well until 6 weeks before this admission, when she noticed a lump in the left lower jaw; there was no pain, tenderness, or discomfort in the jaw. She was evaluated in a primary care clinic of another hospital and was told that a salivary gland may be obstructed. Treatment with sialagogues, increased oral hydration, warm compresses, and massage of the salivary glands were recommended. During the next 3 weeks, the lump in the left jaw increased in size, and swelling of the left side of the face and neck developed. Three weeks before this admission, she returned to the primary care clinic; treatment with cephalexin was started.\nEighteen days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the otolaryngology clinic of the other hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 132/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 86 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.0. There was swelling in the left mandibular and submandibular areas, with no erythema, fluctuance, or palpable salivary stones.\nDr. Hillary R. Kelly: Computed tomography (CT) of the face and neck was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the face (Figure 1) revealed a 3.7-cm mass in the left mandibular body, with lytic and expansile features and numerous internal wavy septations. Areas of marked thinning and obliteration were noted in the buccal and lingual cortexes of the mandible, and extension of the mass among the roots of the first molar, second molar, and premolar was observed. No fluid\u2013fluid or blood\u2013fluid levels were seen within the lesion. There was no lymphadenopathy. The patient was referred to the otolaryngology clinic at this hospital.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT Images of the Face.\nDr. Be: Fifteen days before this admission, the patient reported numbness and tingling in the lower lip and chin on the left side. She had had no fatigue, fever, chills, or redness and no pain in her face, jaw, or neck. On examination, she appeared well but had obvious facial asymmetry with swelling of the left mandible (Figure 2). There was a firm, mildly tender mass in the body of the left mandible that extended to the mandibular angle. Orthodontic braces were in place and dentition and jaw occlusion were normal. The remainder of the ear, nose, and throat examination was normal. The overlying skin was normal, and no anterior or posterior submandibular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was present. The blood levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride were normal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of coagulation and renal function. The calcium level was 11.8 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), and the albumin level was 4.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.3 to 5.0). Radiography of the chest was normal.\nFIGURE 2\n\nClinical Photographs before Excision of the Lesion.\nDr. Vania Nos\u00e9: An intraoral biopsy of the left mandibular mass was performed. Pathological examination (Figure 3C) of the biopsy specimen revealed that the lesion was partially surrounded by reactive bone trabeculae, was hemorrhagic, and contained numerous osteoclast-type giant cells around extravasated red cells, findings that were consistent with a central giant-cell lesion or a central giant-cell granuloma.\nFIGURE 3\n\nSurgical Approach and Biopsy and Surgical Specimens.\nDr. Be: Ten days before this admission, the patient was seen in the oral and maxillofacial surgical clinic of this hospital, and admission for the excision of the left mandibular mass was planned.\nOn admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had normal growth and development and had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had finished the prescribed course of cephalexin and had taken no other medications; penicillin had caused fever and hives early in childhood. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her mother, stepfather, and two cats; she frequently stayed in another suburban area of New England with her father. The patient performed well in high school and participated in theater. She did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. Her mother had hypothyroidism; her father had obstructive sleep apnea. Her maternal grandmother had a history of hypothyroidism, parathyroid adenoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer; her paternal grandfather had died from colon cancer.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/85 mm Hg, and the heart rate 111 beats per minute. The physical examination was unchanged. The left mandibular mass was excised. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed abundant giant cells.\nOn the second hospital day, the calcium level was 12.6 mg per deciliter (3.2 mmol per liter) and the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 396 pg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 60).\nA diagnosis was made.",

Ravicz (Pediatrics): A 20-year-old man with bipolar disorder was transferred to this hospital because of hemoptysis and hypoxemia.\nEleven months before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Six weeks before the current presentation, he was taken to another hospital for evaluation of racing thoughts, generalized hyperactivity, and difficulty sleeping. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. During the admission, the patient was involved in an altercation and was struck on the left side of the chest; pain subsequently developed in that area. Five weeks before the current presentation, chest pain persisted, and nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite developed. The patient was transported from the psychiatric hospital to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Teresa Victoria: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies.\nDr. Ravicz: The patient was told that he had a pulmonary contusion and was transported back to the psychiatric hospital. The dosages of quetiapine and paliperidone were increased. Four weeks before the current presentation, the patient had urticaria and intermittent nausea; a single dose of methylprednisolone was administered. Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged home.\nTen days before the current presentation, chest pain continued, cough developed, and nausea increased in severity. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a second hospital. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest (Figure 1B) revealed a consolidation in the left lower lobe and a left pleural effusion.\nDr. Ravicz: A course of doxycycline was started for the treatment of presumed pneumonia, and the patient was discharged home. During the subsequent 6 days, the cough and chest pain abated. Four days before the current presentation, the course of doxycycline was completed. During the next several days, the cough increased in severity and became productive of yellow sputum with dark-red streaks, and shortness of breath developed; nausea also increased in severity. One day before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated again in the emergency department of the second hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient appeared ill and had difficulty breathing.

The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional evaluation and treatment.\nOn admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and nausea continued. The patient reported fatigue and weight loss that had started after the injury to the chest. He had also noticed discoloration in his fingers that was associated with changes in temperature. There was no headache, abdominal pain, or joint pain.\nThe patient had a history of asthma, migraines, and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. Bipolar disorder had been diagnosed when he was hospitalized for mania, grandiose thoughts, and paranoid delusions. Medications included quetiapine, paliperidone, and methylphenidate. Sulfa drugs and valproate had caused rash, nausea, and vomiting. The patient had previously been sexually active with female partners. He drank alcohol rarely and vaped marijuana frequently; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother, maternal aunt, paternal aunt, and paternal uncle had depression.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 89/40 mm Hg, the heart rate 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute.

    "user_input": "Dr. David P. Bullis (Behavioral Medicine, Newton\u2013Wellesley Hospital, Newton, MA): A 54-year-old man was evaluated by the neuropsychology service of this hospital because of irritability, confusion, and odd behaviors.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before the current evaluation, when he received a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue that had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. He underwent surgical dissection of the neck and resection of the tongue base on the right side, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy, which resulted in cancer remission. After treatment, neck pain and shoulder weakness developed and was attributed to postoperative neuropathy involving the right spinal accessory nerve.\nIn the context of this illness and persistent pain, the patient sought care at the cancer center behavioral medicine clinic of this hospital and received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. During the next 8 months, the patient was seen for psychotherapy approximately every 2 weeks. Treatment for the pain included physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, trigger-point injections, and the use of a scapular elevation brace. Therapy with oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin, tizanidine, and duloxetine was started. Four months before the current evaluation, a sural nerve graft was placed in the right spinal accessory nerve from the proximal, functioning portion to the distal portion, but the pain and weakness did not abate.\nSix weeks before the current evaluation, the patient did not respond to telephone calls for 24 hours. The police were called and found the patient unresponsive with prescription medication bottles nearby. Emergency medical services personnel arrived, and the initial evaluation, in the patient\u2019s home, was notable for a severely decreased respiratory rate. Naloxone was administered, the trachea was intubated, and the patient was taken to a local hospital. In the emergency department, the patient was pulseless with ongoing electrocardiographic activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and epinephrine was administered; after 4 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The dose of methadone was decreased, and therapy with oxycodone, gabapentin, and tizanidine was stopped. During the subsequent 6 days, septic shock, aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and delirium occurred. When these problems resolved, the patient was discharged home.\nFive weeks before the current evaluation, the patient participated in a video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic. He expressed embarrassment and frustration related to his apparent accidental overdose. He described persistent depression, increased anxiety, and no other new symptoms.\nTwo weeks before the current evaluation, the patient missed a routine video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic, and his family was called. For the preceding 2 weeks, they had noticed that the patient was uncharacteristically agitated, irritable, talking loudly, and verbally abusive. Odd behaviors were reported. The patient had gotten lost while driving to a friend\u2019s house that he visited frequently, had been pulled over by police for driving erratically (with normal results on a breathalyzer test), and on another occasion, had been found walking along the highway under an overpass. He called family members repeatedly in the middle of the night, and he would not answer when the calls were returned. When the family requested a police wellness check of the patient, the patient retaliated by requesting a police wellness check of the family members. After this incident, the family was advised to take the patient to a local hospital for admission.\nAt the local hospital, the patient reported no symptoms and noted that he had stopped taking methadone because he was concerned about a medication overdose. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 19, indicating cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.1 Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nonspecific hypodensity in the centrum semiovale on the left side. The patient was told he had mild dementia. Visiting nurse services were arranged, and the patient was discharged home.\nOne week before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s family reported that he had increased confusion and odd behaviors. He was unable to recall details of conversations that had happened minutes before. He could not operate the telephone or remote control and had emptied the trash can into the toilet. He had asked for his clothes to be cut off because he felt uncomfortable. Family members had been staying with the patient every night since his recent discharge because they were concerned about his safety. A neuropsychological evaluation was requested.\nDr. Michael W. Parsons: The evaluation was conducted by the cancer center neuropsychology service of this hospital with the use of videoconferencing technology to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient acknowledged only minimal cognitive changes and was dismissive of the family\u2019s concerns. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, moderate depression, mild anxiety, and difficulty sleeping and keeping track of time.\nAdditional history obtained from the patient\u2019s family included insomnia, lumbar disk herniation, olecranon bursitis, and an inguinal hernia that had led to surgical repair in early adulthood. He had had multiple concussions as a teenager, as well as a brief loss of consciousness during a motor vehicle collision 3 years earlier. After the collision, fatigue, headaches, difficulty concentrating, and impaired memory occurred; during the subsequent 2 years, occupational therapy was provided, and the symptoms gradually resolved.\nMedications at the time of evaluation included ibuprofen, acetaminophen, duloxetine, trazodone, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and multivitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England with family members nearby. He had completed a master\u2019s degree and had had a successful career; he had taken a leave of absence from work 9 months earlier in anticipation of cancer treatment. After cancer treatment, he had been unable to return to work because of pain. He was athletic, walked 3 miles daily, and enjoyed golfing. He rarely drank alcohol and had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs. His family history included breast cancer and dementia in his mother, hearing loss and hypertension in his father, metastatic cancer with an unknown primary source in his paternal grandfather, glaucoma and alcohol use disorder in his maternal grandmother, and a brain tumor in a more distant relative.\nOn video neuropsychological examination, the patient was in no distress and was adequately groomed, with normal-appearing hygiene. His affect was irritable, and the fact that he reported no symptoms suggested limited insight. His spontaneous speech was fluent and well articulated. His thoughts were tangential, and he was frequently forgetful and easily distracted; his information processing speed was slow. A formal neuropsychological assessment revealed impaired executive functioning, marked by disinhibition and poor working memory, as well as deficits in recent memory, verbal fluency, and information processing speed.\nDr. Bullis: A diagnostic test was performed.",

The temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C. The volar aspect of the left wrist was erythematous and swollen, as was the left knee. Tests for Lyme disease antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Radiographs showed subcutaneous edema of the left knee but no fracture, dislocation, or evidence of advanced arthropathy of the left knee or wrist. A 10-day course of prednisone was prescribed for presumed inflammatory arthritis. The joint swelling and pain resolved.\nSix months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the same emergency department because of a painful rash. The temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C. The distal left forearm was erythematous and had scattered small subcutaneous nodules. Laboratory evaluation revealed pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and uric acid were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A plain radiograph of the left wrist showed soft-tissue edema but no abnormalities of the bone. A second course of prednisone was prescribed, and the patient was referred to a dermatologist and a gastroenterologist for consultation.\nTwo weeks later, the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had multiple tan macules on the face and trunk, angiomas, and reddish-purple papules (some >1 cm in diameter) on the left forearm. A biopsy of a papule on the left forearm was performed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed nonspecific suppurative and granulomatous dermatitis. No microorganisms were identified, and culture of the biopsy specimen was negative.\nFour months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had spider angiomas and fullness of the left upper quadrant. On a serum-based test for liver fibrosis (FibroTest), he had a score of 0.96 (with scores of 0.00 to 0.21 indicating no fibrosis and scores of 0.74 to 1.00 indicating severe fibrosis). Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. William R. Bradley: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed a nodular hepatic contour with patchy perfusion but no focal hepatic lesions (Figure 1A). Splenomegaly, portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation, and perigastric, paraesophageal, and splenorenal collateral vessels were also identified (Figure 1B and 1C). There was no dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts; the common bile duct measured 8 mm in diameter (Figure 1D).\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRCP Images.\nDr. Schaefer: Three months before the current evaluation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. Grade 2 esophageal varices were identified and banded. Eight days later, the patient was admitted to a second hospital because of new confusion, lethargy, delayed and slurred speech, and visual hallucinations. The blood ammonia level was 99 \u03bcmol per liter (169 \u03bcg per deciliter; reference range, 11 to 60 \u03bcmol per liter [19 to 102 \u03bcg per deciliter]). Urinalysis was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. Abdominal ultrasound images showed persistent splenomegaly and heterogeneous liver echotexture without ascites. A computed tomographic scan of the head, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, a pattern consistent with incomplete right bundle-branch block, downsloping ST-segment depressions in the precordium, and a prolonged corrected QT interval. Treatment with lactulose was initiated for a working diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. Confusion resolved, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day with arrangements made for additional cardiac testing after discharge.\nOne month before the current evaluation, an echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, mild right ventricular dilatation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation with right atrial dilatation, and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 71 mm Hg. Perfusion images obtained during vasodilator stress testing showed no evidence of inducible left ventricular ischemia. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation.\nIn the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported chronic dyspnea with exertion. He had no orthopnea, chest pain, or palpitations. He had consumed six beers daily for approximately 30 years but had not consumed alcohol during the previous 18 months. Three years before the current presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of dyslipidemia, with a blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 337 mg per deciliter (8.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 129 mg per deciliter [1.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter]) and a total cholesterol level of 380 mg per deciliter (9.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 155 to 199 mg per deciliter [4.0 to 5.1 mmol per liter]). He had a history of opioid use disorder, including intravenous opioids; the disorder had been in remission with the use of buprenorphine\u2013naloxone. Other medical history included depression, insomnia, and multiple knee surgeries. In addition to buprenorphine\u2013naloxone, medications included lactulose, omeprazole, and trazodone. Penicillin had caused a rash. He had worked as a laborer but was disabled and no longer working. He had smoked two cigarettes daily for 30 years. His family history included stroke in his father, diabetes in his mother, and rheumatoid arthritis in his sister.\nOn examination, the heart rate was 73 beats per minute, the blood pressure 99/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 69.9 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.9. He was alert and oriented; asterixis was present. The lung fields were clear, and there was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable hard mass in the epigastrium, a finding that indicated a probable firm caudate lobe of the liver. The knees had healed surgical scars, and there was no edema in the legs. A few spider angiomas were present on the chest. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

    "user_input": "Dr. Kathy M. Tran (Medicine): A 21-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of fatigue, weight gain, and abdominal pain.\nThe patient had been well until 4 months before the current evaluation, when an episode of dull, aching pain in the right lower quadrant occurred. The pain lasted for a few hours before resolving spontaneously. During the next 4 months, episodes of abdominal pain continued to occur and increased in duration, frequency, and severity. The patient sought evaluation in the gynecology clinic of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient described the pain as variable, rating it between 3 and 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The episodes of pain occurred daily and lasted for up to 20 hours. The pain decreased with sitting or lying down and did not increase with movement; it was not associated with her menstrual period. The patient also reported fatigue, irritability, and weight gain of 4.5 kg in the previous 4 months despite increased exercise and decreased food intake.\nThere was a history of hypothyroidism, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and migraines. The patient had never been pregnant and had no known history of sexually transmitted infections or abnormal results on screening tests for cervical cancer. She had previously been sexually active with male partners, but she reported no current sexual activity. She had taken oral contraceptives for 2 years but had stopped taking them 6 months before this evaluation, when a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) was placed. Other medications included levothyroxine, citalopram, and multivitamins; there were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived with roommates in an urban area of New England. She was a former athlete and worked as a research scientist. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her mother, coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia in her father, breast cancer and diabetes in her paternal grandmother, and lung cancer in her paternal grandfather.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 119/73 mm Hg and the heart rate 62 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The thyroid was firm on palpation, with a small nodule noted on the right side. The abdomen was nondistended, soft, and nontender. A small hernia with a thrill was noted at the right inguinal ring. A speculum examination of the vagina and cervix was normal; IUD strings were visible at the cervical os. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes and glucose and results of tests for kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis were negative. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Madeleine Sertic: Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass (measuring 4.8 cm by 5.0 cm by 3.9 cm) along the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe (Figure 1A). The uterus, ovaries, and adnexa were normal. There was no free fluid in the pelvis, and the IUD was in an appropriate position.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a right adrenal mass (measuring 4.5 cm by 4.7 cm by 4.0 cm) that was T2 isointense (Figure 1B) and T1 hypointense. The mass had diffusion restriction (Figure 1C), as well as early enhancement with washout, which refers to the temporal reduction in the enhancement of a lesion. The features were indeterminate and were not definitively diagnostic of adrenal adenoma or another adrenal lesion, such as pheochromocytoma or adrenocortical carcinoma.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis again revealed a right adrenal mass, which had a density of 33 Hounsfield units (HU) before the administration of contrast material (Figure 1D), 74 HU during the portal-venous phase (Figure 1E), and 45 HU during the 15-minute delayed phase (Figure 1F). The absolute washout was calculated as 71%. The absolute washout is calculated by dividing the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the delayed-phase density by the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the unenhanced density and then converting the result to a percentage: [(HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU delayed phase) / (HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU unenhanced)] \u00d7 100. Adrenal adenomas tend to wash out faster than other adrenal lesions, and an absolute washout of more than 60% is highly suggestive of an adrenal adenoma. However, lesions larger than 4 cm are likely to be malignant, regardless of the washout characteristics.1 There was also a thin-walled cyst (measuring 3.3 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the left lung.\nDr. Tran: The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Additional laboratory tests were performed to further evaluate the adrenal mass. Blood levels of renin and aldosterone were normal, as were urinary levels of catecholamines and metanephrines. An overnight, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed. The baseline blood corticotropin level was 3 pg per milliliter (0.7 pmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 76 pg per milliliter [1.3 to 16.7 pmol per liter]). At 11 p.m., dexamethasone (1 mg) was administered; at 8 a.m., the blood cortisol level was 9.1 \u03bcg per deciliter (251 nmol per liter; reference value, <1.8 \u03bcg per deciliter [50 nmol per liter]), and the concurrent blood dexamethasone level was 631 ng per deciliter (reference range, 140 to 295). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 31.0 \u03bcg (reference range, 3.5 to 45.0); the blood levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were normal.\nManagement decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Victoria Clark (Neurosurgery): A 25-year-old woman with a history of migraines was admitted to this hospital with progressively worsening headaches and photophobia during the previous 6 weeks and a 1-week history of nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision.\nSix weeks before this admission, the patient began to have headaches that were not characteristic of her previous migraines. She described these headaches as discomfort in the middle of her head that was associated with photophobia, phonophobia, and tinnitus. She reported that she was occasionally awakened from sleep because of headache and that the headache was always present on awakening in the morning. The headache was worse with coughing and abated with standing; treatment with ibuprofen did not reduce the discomfort.\nOne week before admission, nausea and vomiting developed, along with blurred vision when the patient looked to the left. She also reported occasional episodes of total vision loss that lasted for several seconds. When she was unable to eat food because of worsening nausea and vomiting, she presented to another hospital for evaluation. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles with hypodensity that involved the dorsal brain stem and cerebellar hemispheres (Figure 1A); a possible soft-tissue mass in the region of the fourth ventricular outlet was also observed. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Head and Spine.\nOn arrival, the patient reported ongoing headache and nausea. Other medical history included obesity and opioid use disorder, which was treated with oral buprenorphine\u2013naloxone and was complicated by relapses with injection of heroin; she last injected heroin 1 month before admission. Other medications included ibuprofen as needed. She had no known allergies. She smoked a half pack of cigarettes daily and did not drink alcohol. The patient lived in a wooded area of New England with four cats and one dog. She spent time outside, although she had become less active owing to headache. She was sexually active with one male partner and had no history of sexually transmitted infections. She had not traveled outside of New England. She had had periods of homelessness in the past, but she had not stayed in shelters. She had been incarcerated 2 years before this admission. She did not eat uncooked meat or seafood. Two paternal family members had had ovarian cancer.\nOn examination, the patient was alert, interactive, and did not appear to be in distress. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 117/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 42.6. There were track marks on the legs. The patient was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. On bedside visual field testing, she reported decreased vision in the peripheral fields and double vision on looking to the far left, which was accompanied by a left sixth-nerve palsy; papilledema was present in both eyes. The remainder of the cranial-nerve examination was normal. Tests of motor strength and sensation were normal. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count and differential count and the results of liver- and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed elevated signal hyperintensity involving the periaqueductal gray matter, dorsal midbrain, dorsal pons, superior and middle cerebellar peduncles, dentate nuclei, and cerebellar white matter (Figure 1B). There was obstructive hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Leptomeningeal enhancement was observed surrounding the brain stem and extending through the inferior aspect of the posterior fossa with entrapment of the fourth ventricle (Figure 1C). There was also leptomeningeal enhancement along multiple upper and lower cranial nerves.\nDr. Clark: Treatment with intravenous acetazolamide and oral dexamethasone was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the neurocritical care unit. On the first hospital day, the patient underwent stereotactically guided endoscopic exploration of the right ventricle. The right foramen of Monro was patent, but there was obstruction in the underlying third ventricle due to adhesions and aberrant anatomical features that precluded endoscopic third ventriculostomy. An external ventricular drain was placed; the opening pressure was 10 cm of water. Analysis of a CSF specimen obtained from the external ventricular drain showed 2 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 90% were neutrophils and 10% were monocytes, and 768 red cells per microliter (reference value, 0); the CSF levels of protein and glucose were normal.\nDexamethasone therapy was discontinued, and treatment with intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone was initiated. Airborne precautions were instituted, and an induced sputum sample was obtained for mycobacterial culture. No acid-fast bacilli were observed on examination of smears of three sputum samples obtained sequentially, and polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of one of the samples for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. CSF cultures were negative, and cytologic examination of the CSF did not show malignant cells.\nDr. Rohatgi: On the third hospital day, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. On the fourth hospital day, MRI of the spine revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, most notably in the lumbar spine, with masslike confluent enhancement filling the subarachnoid space at L5\u2013S2 (Figure 1F).\nDr. Clark: On the fifth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed; the CSF analysis revealed 1120 nucleated cells, of which 77% were neutrophils, and 23 red cells. The CSF protein level was 740 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the glucose level 19 mg per deciliter (1.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). The opening pressure was 10 cm of water relative to the external auditory meatus, which was the same as the pressure that was simultaneously recorded from the clamped external ventricular drain. CSF was sent for culture and cytologic studies.\nA diagnostic test result was received.",

McFadden (Medicine): A 22-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital in the summer before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic because of headache, fever, and respiratory failure.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 8 days before the current presentation, when nausea and myalgias developed. Over the next 2 days, chills, vomiting, neck pain, and headache with sonophobia developed. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital, where an evaluation reportedly showed dry mucous membranes but no signs of meningitis. The white-cell count was 12,300 per microliter (reference range, 4800 to 10,800), and the platelet count was 95,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Intravenous normal saline and morphine were administered, and the patient was discharged with supportive care for a presumed viral syndrome.\nDuring the next week, the patient had worsening headache and new photophobia, as well as malaise, anorexia, nonproductive cough, and dyspnea with minimal exertion. Two days before the current presentation, the patient\u2019s mother noticed episodes of confusion with nonsensical speech and excessive sleepiness, and she took the patient back to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported ongoing severe headaches and dyspnea. The temporal temperature was 38.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient had photophobia, but the neurologic examination was reportedly otherwise normal. She had mild throat erythema and diffuse abdominal tenderness with intermittent guarding. A urine test for beta human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained.\nTable 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed subarachnoid hemorrhage and diffuse ischemic changes in the parietal and temporal lobes. Lumbar puncture was deferred because of thrombocytopenia. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed diffuse interstitial lung markings, multiple opacities and nodules in the peripheral lung, two hypodensities in the peripheral spleen, and subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and doxycycline was administered. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital.\nThe next morning, screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus were negative, as was a blood-smear examination for parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Platelets were transfused, and intravenous normal saline was administered. The respiratory rate increased to 45 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 93% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 8 liters per minute; ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure was attempted, and intravenous furosemide was administered. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole were discontinued, and empirical treatment with intravenous meropenem and clindamycin was administered. The patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital.\nOn arrival at this hospital, the patient had confusion and tachypnea and thus provided a limited history, but family members provided additional information. The patient had a history of depression, for which she received citalopram. She had no known drug allergies. She worked in health care. She drank wine socially, used electronic cigarettes, and occasionally smoked marijuana but did not smoke tobacco. Her most recent travel had been to the Caribbean more than 1 year before the current presentation. She had no exposure to wooded or rural areas. Her family had dogs, but she had no bites or scratches; she had no other animal or insect exposures. There were no recent sexual contacts. Her mother had cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and her maternal grandmother had Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 103/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 49 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 8 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22. The patient appeared to be in respiratory distress, with accessory muscles used for breathing. She was oriented only after prompting. She had meningismus and concomitant rigidity of the shoulders with passive range of motion, but she had no focal cranial-nerve, strength, or sensory deficits. Auscultation of the lungs and heart revealed diffuse rales and rhonchi, as well as a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur that was loudest at the apex and left axilla and radiated to the sternum. The spleen tip was palpable. A small patch of petechiae was present on the upper chest. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of phosphorus, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; antinuclear antibodies were undetectable. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional blood cultures were obtained. Chest radiography showed diffuse lung opacities and pleural effusions on both sides. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia with normal intervals and nonspecific minor ST- and T-wave changes. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, doxycycline, and acyclovir was administered.\nFour hours after admission, increased work of breathing, tachypnea, and confusion progressed, and the trachea was intubated for initiation of mechanical ventilation. Intravenous propofol, hydromorphone, and phenylephrine were administered. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, revealing mildly bloody and frothy effluent from all the lobes of the lungs. On examination of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, the nucleated-cell count was 375 per microliter, with 77% neutrophils. Gram\u2019s staining showed no organisms. Tests for common respiratory virus \u2014 including influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses \u2014 were negative. A culture was also obtained.\nDr. Eric W. Zhang: CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral scattered curvilinear hyperdensities in the cortical sulci, findings suggestive of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (Figure 1A). There were also focal hypodense regions in the left superior parietal lobule and right temporal lobe with loss of normal gray\u2013white matter differentiation, findings suggestive of acute cortical infarcts (Figure 1B). CT pulmonary angiography showed evidence of mild interstitial edema, bilateral pleural effusions, and multifocal peribronchovascular nodular opacities and consolidations involving all the lobes of the lungs, some of which were peripherally distributed, without cavitation (Figure 1C). CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed several splenic hypodensities, which were most likely splenic infarcts, with accompanying mild ascites and mild periportal edema (Figure 1D).\nFigure 1\n\nCT and MRI Images.\nDr. McFadden: Platelets were transfused, and lumbar puncture was performed, with an opening pressure of 38 cm of water. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, the glucose level was 41 mg per deciliter (reference range, 50 to 75), the protein level 31 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), the red-cell count 2400 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and the nucleated-cell count 49 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 76% neutrophils, 16% monocytes, and 8% lymphocytes.\nDr. Zhang: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed multifocal subarachnoid sulcal hyperintensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, findings that can be seen with subarachnoid hemorrhage or acute meningitis (Figure 1E). The focal hypodense regions in the left superior parietal lobule and right temporal lobe that had been noted previously on CT were associated with restricted diffusion on an apparent-diffusion-coefficient map (Figure 1F) and on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure 1G) from MRI of the head, which is compatible with bilateral acute cortical infarcts.",

Radcliffe (Medicine): A 46-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of arthritis and rash.\nOne week before the current presentation, an episode of lightheadedness occurred when the patient stood up from a seated position. The episode was associated with diaphoresis and mild nausea; it lasted for a few minutes and resolved spontaneously. Four days later, another episode of lightheadedness occurred, and the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 147/80 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Swelling of the wrists and ankles was present. The blood levels of glucose and electrolytes and the results of kidney-function tests were normal. The aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were normal; the alkaline phosphatase level was 157 U per liter (reference range, 45 to 115). The complete blood count with differential count was normal, as was the urinalysis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 104 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 14), the C-reactive protein level 6.3 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the d-dimer level 990 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500).\nAn electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material timed to evaluate the pulmonary arteries, showed no pulmonary embolus or pulmonary nodules; there was no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Intravenous crystalloid solution was administered, and the lightheadedness resolved. Plans were made for an evaluation of the joint swelling and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the rheumatology clinic affiliated with this hospital. The patient was discharged home.\nThree days later, the patient was seen in the rheumatology clinic. Additional history was obtained. Four months before the current presentation, mild coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) had developed after the patient had returned from a vacation in Central America and the Caribbean. Symptoms associated with Covid-19 resolved after 5 days. One week after the resolution of symptoms, and 14 weeks before the current presentation, pain and swelling of the wrists had developed. There was morning stiffness in both wrists and difficulty with forming a fist; the stiffness abated with activity and hot showers. The patient had had a partial response after the administration of topical diclofenac, acetaminophen, and plant-based topical applications for joint pain. He also had noted a sensation of instability in the ankles occurring toward the end of the day. In addition to the joint symptoms, a rash involving the chest, back, and legs had developed; the palms and soles were spared. The rash was mildly pruritic at night and nonpainful. Alopecia, anorexia, and an estimated 8 kg of weight loss had also occurred. Two weeks before the current presentation, nasal crusting had developed, and the patient had noted the presence of scant blood when using facial tissue.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for asthma and eczema. Medications included topical triamcinolone and topical hydrocortisone. An unspecified allergy to diphenhydramine had been reported previously. The patient lived in Boston and worked in an office. He smoked a half pack of cigarettes and consumed two alcoholic beverages daily. There was no history of illicit drug use. He was sexually active with men; his most recent sexual activity, with a new partner, had occurred 5 months before the current presentation. His family history included psoriasis in his grandmother.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 156/90 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Multiple small areas of alopecia were scattered throughout the scalp, and there was crusting in the distal nares. The left commissure of the mouth had an ulcerative lesion; there was no evidence of mucosal lesions or cervical lymphadenopathy. Swelling, warmth, and mild tenderness of the wrists and ankles were present. Swelling of several metacarpophalangeal joints was also present. There was a hyperpigmented, macular rash with scaling that involved the trunk (Figure 1), back, and legs, extending to the dorsal aspect of the feet. The heart rate was tachycardic but regular, without murmurs. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photograph.\nDiagnostic tests were performed.",

Murphy: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung that measured 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm, as well as bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImages Obtained 6 Months before Current Admission.\nDr. Bozym: An endobronchial ultrasound\u2013guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node was performed. Cytologic examination of the specimen revealed small-cell carcinoma.\nFive months before the current admission, the patient sought a second opinion in the oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient was counseled about the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer and the need for additional imaging before consideration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Additional imaging was scheduled, along with a follow-up appointment. The patient did not undergo additional imaging and did not attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic of either this hospital or the other hospital.\nSix weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed swelling of both legs. Ten days before this admission, the swelling had not abated, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient described himself as generally healthy and did not report any chronic health conditions. He reported no fever, chills, shortness of breath, or pain. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s brother. The patient had been pursuing alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer that included a strict diet and intravenous infusions, and he had not shared the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer with his family until several days earlier. The patient\u2019s brother believed that the patient was in denial about the diagnosis.\nWhen the patient was 12 years of age, he had received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which had been treated with radiation therapy and splenectomy. Fifteen years before this presentation, ischemic colitis had been treated with small-bowel resection. One year before this presentation, deep-vein thrombosis had been treated with a 4-month course of anticoagulation. There was no history of psychiatric disease. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies; he did not disclose details about the infusions that he had received as alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents. He was divorced and frequently visited his children. He worked part-time as a skilled tradesman. Family members reported that he was a lifelong nonsmoker.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 167/95 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and appeared well, but he looked thinner than he had looked during his evaluation at the oncology clinic 5 months earlier. The abdomen had a healed surgical scar, and the legs had symmetric 1+ edema.

CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed numerous new ill-defined rim-enhancing hepatic lesions, which measured up to 8.0 cm in diameter; an adrenal mass, which measured 4.1 cm by 3.4 cm; and thrombosis of the branches of the right portal vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImages Obtained on Current Admission.\nDr. Bozym: Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the next 3 days, additional supplemental potassium was administered. During follow-up interviews, the patient acknowledged the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer, but he did not explain why he had not shared the diagnosis with his family or provide details about the alternative treatment that he had pursued. On the fourth hospital day, the blood potassium level increased, and the patient asked to go home. He stated that he was willing to attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic, but he was evasive when chemotherapy and immunotherapy were discussed. The patient was discharged.\nOne week after discharge, and 1 day before the current admission, the patient\u2019s father accompanied the patient to receive massage therapy and an intravenous infusion as alternative treatment. During the infusion, the patient abruptly became volatile, agitated, and angry. On the drive home, he refused to close the window and stared into the distance. He stated that doctors had cast spells on him during his recent hospitalization and that he had killed his oldest child, which was not true.\nThe next day, the patient borrowed his brother\u2019s car without permission and drove across the state. After he returned home, family members brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient stated that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d for being in the hospital. He initially reported no symptoms, but on specific questioning, he acknowledged fatigue, weight loss, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and ongoing leg swelling. He reported that he did not feel confused, afraid, or worried and that he had no suicidal or homicidal thoughts or auditory or visual hallucinations. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family members. The patient had not slept for several days. His aggressive and erratic behavior and delusions were not typical, although he could become easily angered and had a long-standing belief that his doctors had administered radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma to make money.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 194/106 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The patient alternated between being alert and lethargic, and he could state the names of his children but not their ages. He was cooperative but intermittently paused and stared; he was not distracted by external stimuli, but he seemed to be responding to internal stimuli. He spoke only a couple of words at a time and answered most questions by nodding or shaking his head. There was generalized weakness, which was most pronounced in the proximal muscle groups. The leg edema was unchanged, and the skin appeared abnormally tan; there was no scleral icterus, sublingual jaundice, or asterixis.\nThe blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter, the carbon dioxide level 37 mmol per liter (reference range, 22 to 32), and the ammonia level 51 \u03bcmol per liter (87 \u03bcg per deciliter; reference range, 12 to 48 \u03bcmol per liter [20 to 82 \u03bcg per deciliter]). The white-cell count was 13,530 per microliter. Urinalysis was normal, and urine and blood toxicologic testing was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, was normal. Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

Meizlish (Medicine): A 57-year-old woman with resected stage IIIC cutaneous melanoma was admitted to this hospital because of fever.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 months before the current admission, when bleeding developed from a lesion on the right side of the scalp. After evaluation by her primary care physician, she was referred to a surgical clinic at another hospital; examination of a skin-biopsy specimen revealed ulcerated melanoma with positive margins. The patient was referred to the oncology clinic of this hospital.\nThree months before the current admission, a wide local excision of the scalp lesion and a neck lymph-node dissection were performed; examination of the specimens revealed metastatic melanoma in 2 of 26 lymph nodes. A diagnosis of stage IIIC melanoma was made. Molecular profiling identified the BRAF V600E mutation, and treatment with adjuvant therapy was planned to begin after the patient had recovered fully from surgery.\nOne month before the current admission, the patient was evaluated in the oncology clinic for initiation of treatment with a combination of dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (a MEK inhibitor) as targeted therapy for melanoma. She felt well, and the surgical wound had healed. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

The blood levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of kidney function. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again stopped, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was started. Fever and nausea resolved after 1 day, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was stopped. Once the patient had 1 day without recurrent fever after the antipyretic medications had been stopped, treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again resumed.\nFour days before the current admission, fever recurred. The patient was again evaluated at the other hospital. Results of liver tests and kidney-function tests were again normal, as was the complete blood count. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again stopped, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was initiated. Daily fevers persisted for 4 days, and the patient was advised to present to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported fatigue that had started 1 month earlier and had gradually increased in severity, as well as light-headedness when standing from a seated position. She also reported intermittent vomiting, loose stools, and pain in the right upper quadrant that increased after eating but no diarrhea or dysuria. She had a dry cough without shortness of breath.\nOther medical history included carpal tunnel syndrome that had been treated with carpal tunnel release surgery. The patient had no known drug allergies. She worked as a nurse and lived with her husband and two adult children in a coastal region of New England. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit drugs. Her father had hyperthyroidism; her mother had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease.\nThe temporal temperature was 40.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 85/53 mm Hg, the pulse 108 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was diaphoretic and appeared ill. The mucous membranes were moist, and no lesions were present in the oropharynx. The heart sounds were regular, with no murmurs, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. There was mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No rash was present.\nThe white-cell count was 5190 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); 20% of the cells were bands (reference range, 0 to 10), and 10% were metamyelocytes (reference value, 0). The platelet count was 87,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The blood level of creatinine was 2.73 mg per deciliter (241 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), AST 190 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32), ALT 62 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and alkaline phosphatase 173 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100).

He had lost 4.5 kg in the past month after making healthier dietary choices; however, he had also noticed abdominal discomfort and a decrease in appetite.\nDuring the next week, the patient was able to eat and drink very little and lost an additional 4.5 kg. The fatigue and weakness worsened, and he mostly stayed in bed. He had several episodes of lightheadedness, gait instability, and falls while he was walking to the bathroom. There was new odynophagia, dysphagia, and nausea.\nOn the day of admission, the patient was evaluated at the transplant nephrology clinic of this hospital before a scheduled infusion of belatacept. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 70/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared cachectic and lethargic. He was transported by ambulance from the clinic to the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported malaise and feeling like he had no energy or strength. The lightheadedness and gait instability persisted. A review of systems was notable for shortness of breath, dark urine, and continued anorexia, nausea, odynophagia, dysphagia, and abdominal discomfort. He reported no chills, night sweats, cough, chest pain, vomiting, hematochezia, melena, or dysuria.\nThe patient had a history of sarcoidosis. Nine years before this admission, nephrocalcinosis caused end-stage kidney disease. Hemodialysis was started, and this treatment was continued until a deceased-donor kidney transplantation was performed 7 months before this admission. Routine serologic testing performed before transplantation was positive for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) IgG and cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Serologic testing in the donor was also positive for EBV IgG but was negative for CMV IgG. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin was initiated; maintenance therapy included prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus.\nSix months before the current admission, pathological examination of a biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed vascular disease of donor origin and acute tubular injury but no evidence of T-cell\u2013mediated or antibody-mediated rejection. Treatment with tacrolimus was stopped and belatacept started; prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil therapy was continued.\nOne month before the current admission, pathological examination of another biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed focal infiltrates that were vaguely granulomatous and were associated with ruptured tubules and interstitial Tamm\u2013Horsfall protein (also known as uromodulin). There was no evidence of allograft rejection.\nTwo weeks before the current admission, laboratory tests revealed a blood creatinine level of 2.31 mg per deciliter (204.2 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53.0 to 132.6 \u03bcmol per liter]); routine laboratory tests had revealed similar creatinine levels during the previous 6 months.

There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his mother in an urban area of New England and had never traveled outside the region. He worked as an administrator and had never been homeless or incarcerated. He had no sexual partners and did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol.\nOn the day of evaluation in the emergency department, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.5. The patient was lethargic and spoke in sentences of three or four words. The mucous membranes were dry, and the throat could not be evaluated because of nausea. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Auscultation of the lungs revealed diffuse inspiratory crackles. Neurologic examination was limited but was notable for 4/5 motor strength in the arms and legs.\nThe blood level of creatinine was 5.05 mg per deciliter (446.4 \u03bcmol per liter), the calcium level 13.1 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), the lactic acid level 4.4 mmol per liter (39.6 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18.0 mg per deciliter]), and the hemoglobin level 6.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5). Cultures of blood were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Mark C. Murphy: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the chest (Figure 1) revealed innumerable bilateral miliary pulmonary nodules that were new relative to a CT scan that had been obtained 6 months earlier. The nodules were in a random distribution that was suggestive of a hematogenous origin. Trace bilateral pleural effusions were present, as was calcified mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy; the lymphadenopathy appeared unchanged from previous imaging. CT of the spleen (Figure 2) revealed new splenomegaly. There was new mild dilatation of the renal collecting system of the transplanted kidney in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Chest Obtained on Admission.\nFIGURE 2\n\nCT of the Abdomen and Spleen.\nDr. Lee: While the patient was being evaluated in the emergency department, the temperature increased to 39.6\u00b0C. Intravenous fluids and intravenous infusion of phenylephrine were administered. Empirical treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, levofloxacin, doxycycline, and micafungin was started; trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and valganciclovir were continued. Treatment with prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued, and hydrocortisone therapy was started. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nWithin 24 hours after admission, the oxygen saturation had decreased to 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air; supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 94%. Continuous intravenous infusion of phenylephrine was continued, and norepinephrine was added to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mm Hg. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The creatinine level decreased to 3.82 mg per deciliter (337.7 \u03bcmol per liter), the lactic acid level to 1.6 mmol per liter (14.4 mg per deciliter), and the calcium level to 8.9 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter). Treatment with levofloxacin and micafungin was stopped; isavuconazole was started.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

Nestor (Medicine): A 19-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of respiratory failure.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 weeks before the current presentation, when pain developed in the right shoulder and the right flank. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital and was discharged home after testing for kidney stones and appendicitis was reportedly negative.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, dyspnea with exertion and nonproductive cough developed. Six days after the onset of dyspnea and cough, the patient departed on a vacation cruise with her family. During the 8-day trip, dyspnea and cough worsened and prevented her from participating in activities such as swimming and hiking. By the end of the cruise, she had severe dyspnea with walking, and she required the use of a wheelchair during her trip home. After returning to Massachusetts, she presented to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation.\nThe patient reported ongoing cough and progressively worsening dyspnea but no chest pain or hemoptysis. The temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 132 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/47 mm Hg, the respiratory rate more than 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while she was breathing ambient air. She appeared ill and had increased work of breathing. A murmur was heard on cardiac examination; other details of the examination are not available. An electrocardiogram (ECG) reportedly showed sinus tachycardia and lateral and precordial T-wave inversions. Urinalysis results and blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; the blood level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 24,913 pg per milliliter (reference range, 5 to 125).

Point-of-care ultrasonography reportedly revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, marked aortic regurgitation, and a possible aortic-root abscess. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula. Treatment with intravenous furosemide, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin was started. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit of this hospital.\nOn arrival at the cardiac intensive care unit, the patient received bilevel positive airway pressure. A family member accompanying the patient provided additional history. The patient had had intermittent back pain beginning 6 months before the current presentation. Two months before the current presentation, she had had asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Five weeks before the current presentation, she had had a dental cleaning. During the cruise, the patient had two episodes of diarrhea without fever or chills; the family member did not know whether other persons on the cruise had been ill. The patient had told her family that she had noticed visible pulsations in her chest during the 2 weeks before the current presentation, and the family member reported that the patient\u2019s breathing had appeared labored while she was sleeping.\nOther medical history included anxiety and anemia. The patient took supplemental iron and had no known drug allergies. She did not use alcohol, tobacco, or other substances. She lived with her family in Massachusetts and worked in child care. There was no family history of cardiac or autoimmune disease.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure 145/58 mm Hg in the right arm and 136/65 mm Hg in the left arm, the respiratory rate 48 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving bilevel positive airway pressure (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.70). The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. While the patient was sitting in an upright position, she had increased work of breathing and intermittent cough. The heart rhythm was tachycardic, with a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the base and a grade 3/4 decrescendo diastolic murmur at the base that radiated to the apex, without an S3 gallop. Carotid and subclavian bruits were present. The jugular venous pressure was 8 cm of water. There were rales and decreased breath sounds in both lungs. Brachial, ulnar, radial, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses were symmetric. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, thyrotropin, lipase, human chorionic gonadotropin, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of liver function and kidney function. A urine toxicology screening test was negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 77 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the blood level of C-reactive protein was 147.8 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Tests for SARS-CoV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative.\nDr. Eric M. Isselbacher: An ECG (Figure 1A) showed sinus tachycardia, a borderline rightward axis, poor R-wave progression in leads V1 through V4, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 1B through 1F and Videos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 34%. The aortic valve was tricuspid, without evidence of vegetation or aortic-root abscess, but there was incomplete closure of the aortic valve, which resulted in severe aortic regurgitation. The ascending thoracic aorta was dilated, measuring 44 mm in diameter, with thickened walls. The dilated left ventricle caused tethering of the mitral valve, which resulted in mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation and mild left atrial enlargement. There was a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of cardiac tamponade.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCardiac Studies.\nDr. Vinit Baliyan: CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 2) showed an irregular aortic contour with narrowing of the lumen in the vessels of the aortic arch and in the right renal artery. This imaging was performed with ECG gating, which allowed for the assessment of the aortic root. There was no evidence of a perivalvular abscess. However, circumferential wall thickening was present in the aorta at the root and in the ascending segment. In addition, there was circumferential wall thickening in partially visualized proximal vessels of the aortic arch and in the abdominal aorta. The mural thickening of the aorta showed enhancement that was suggestive of active inflammation; this enhancement was most visible in the abdominal aorta. Other findings included cardiomegaly with a markedly dilated left ventricle, alveolar pulmonary edema, a small pericardial effusion, and bilateral small pleural effusions.\nFIGURE 2\n\nCT Angiography of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.\nDr. Nestor: A diagnosis and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Gregory M. Cote: A 52-year-old man with a metastatic solitary fibrous tumor was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 1.5 years before the current admission, when dysuria and pain in the lower abdomen and left leg developed after a motor vehicle accident. At another hospital, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reportedly revealed an incidental 14-cm necrotic mass in the pelvis, anterior to the bladder. Biopsy of the mass was reportedly diagnostic of a solitary fibrous tumor.\nThe patient was referred to the multidisciplinary oncology clinic of this hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed for staging, revealed two 9-mm nodules in the left lung. The patient was treated with a 3-month course of dacarbazine chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy targeting the pelvic mass, and then he underwent surgical resection of the pelvic tumor, including partial cystectomy and placement of a ureteral stent. Pathological examination of the resected specimen (Figure 1) confirmed the diagnosis of spindle-cell sarcoma with features consistent with a dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumor. Immunohistochemical staining of the resected specimen revealed signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and CD34 in the tumor cells. Stereotactic radiation therapy for the lung nodules was also administered.\nFIGURE 1\n\nSpecimen of the Resected Mass.\nHowever, metastatic disease progressed in the lungs, chest, bladder, and right leg. Over the subsequent 12-month period, the patient underwent serial treatment with four different chemotherapeutic regimens: pazopanib, doxorubicin with olaratumab, gemcitabine with docetaxel, and vinorelbine. Palliative radiation therapy for a painful leg metastasis was also provided.\nEleven days after the initiation of vinorelbine chemotherapy and 30 days before the current admission, the patient was admitted to this hospital with fever (temperature, 38.3\u00b0C), neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, 770 per microliter; reference range, 1800 to 7700), and pneumonia in the left lower lobe.\nDr. Reece J. Goiffon: CT of the chest and abdomen (Figure 2A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed known metastatic involvement of the lungs, bladder, retroperitoneum, peritoneum, skeletal muscles, and subcutaneous fat. There was no metastatic involvement of the adrenal glands, pancreas, or liver.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Cote: Empirical treatment with cefepime was administered. Over the next several days, the neutropenia and fever resolved and the pneumonia abated. On the seventh hospital day, the patient was discharged home with a follow-up visit scheduled in the oncology clinic.\nEleven days after hospital discharge and 12 days before the current admission, the patient attended a scheduled outpatient visit for an infusion. He reported weakness and appeared confused. A fingerstick glucose level was 47 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter). Supplemental oral and intravenous glucose was administered, and his mental status improved, but fingerstick glucose levels remained below 70 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter). Review of fingerstick glucose measurements obtained during the patient\u2019s recent hospitalization showed multiple levels ranging from 50 to 60 mg per deciliter (2.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter).\nThe patient was admitted to the oncology unit of this hospital for the management of hypoglycemia. Laboratory test results from the second hospital admission are shown in Table 1. While the patient was in the hospital, he began to have diaphoresis that correlated with episodes of hypoglycemia, for which he received orange juice and dextrose. On evaluation by a dietitian, he was found to be meeting anticipated caloric requirements. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day; the blood glucose level was 55 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter) before discharge.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), 12 Days before Current Admission (Second Admission Day 1), 11 Days before Current Admission (Second Admission Day 2), 6 Days before Current Admission (Follow-up Visit), Current Admission Day 1, Current Admission Day 2\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 7.5, 6.8, 8.0, 7.9, 7.4\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 23.7, 21.7, 25.0, 24.8, 23.6\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 6350, 5390, 6740, 11,120, 6330\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 106,000, 85,000, 87,000, 91,000, 74,000\n\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 134, 136, 137, 139, 139\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 3.3, 3.4, 4.3, 4.0, 3.8\nChloride (mmol/liter), 100\u2013108, 97, 100, 101, 106, 105\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 25, 23, 26, 23, 21\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 3, 3, 6, 4, 3\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.44, 0.32, 0.39, 0.40, 0.50\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 68, 45, 96, 49, 145\nPhosphorus (mg/dl), 2.6\u20134.5, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 3.6, 3.8\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 8.8, 8.7, 8.7, 9.8, 9.0\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 2.8, \u2014, 3.0, 3.1, \u2014\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 7, \u2014, 6, 10, \u2014\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201340, 22, \u2014, 20, 18, \u2014\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013115, 65, \u2014, 72, 72, \u2014\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 0.6, \u2014, 0.5, 0.6, \u2014\nInsulin (\u00b5U/ml), 2.6\u201325.0, \u2014, <0.2, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nC\u2011peptide (ng/ml), 1.1\u20134.4, \u2014, <0.1, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\n\u03b2\u2011Hydroxybutyrate (mmol/liter), <0.4, \u2014, <0.1, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nCortisol, morning (\u00b5g/dl), 5.0\u201325.0, \u2014, 13.5, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nRepeat cortisol, after cosyntropin (\u00b5g/dl), \u2014, \u2014, 21.7, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nLactate (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.2, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.9, \u2014\nTroponin T (ng/ml), <0.03, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, <0.01, \u2014\n\nThree days later and 6 days before the current admission, the patient attended the scheduled follow-up visit in the oncology clinic. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with trabectedin was initiated, along with pegfilgrastim and a 3-day tapering course of dexamethasone. The day after the dexamethasone course was completed, the patient reported increased fatigue and cough. Two days later, he was admitted to the oncology unit because of weakness and diaphoresis; a fingerstick glucose level was 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter).\nOn the current admission, review of systems was notable for fatigue; pain associated with tumors involving the back, shoulders, and right leg; numbness of the right leg; the use of an indwelling Foley catheter for 2 months owing to urinary retention; dull chest pain and intermittent dyspnea that had persisted for 4 months; and constipation. The patient had no recent anorexia, weight change, fever, chills, orthopnea, hemoptysis, light-headedness, dizziness, palpitations, syncope, nausea, or vomiting.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for transfusion-dependent anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (for which he had received metformin, although not in the previous 6 months), hypertension, a colonic tubular adenoma, a renal cyst, osteoarthritis, chronic low-back pain, and depression. He had undergone an appendectomy in the remote past. Medications included oral gabapentin, cyanocobalamin, tamsulosin, and finasteride; transdermal fentanyl; and oral acetaminophen, clonazepam, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and oxycodone as needed. He had no access to insulin or other hypoglycemic medications. There were no known adverse drug reactions.\nThe patient had formerly worked as a laborer and had been receiving disability benefits since the motor vehicle accident. He had previously consumed six beers per week and smoked one pack of cigarettes per day, but he had stopped drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco 1 year earlier. There was no history of other substance use. His family history of cancer included melanoma in his father, thyroid cancer in his sister, ovarian cancer in his maternal grandmother, leukemia in his maternal aunt, and sarcoma in his paternal uncle. His mother had hypertension and dyslipidemia, and a brother had diabetes. The patient had an adult child, who was healthy.\nThe tympanic temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Multiple tender, palpable masses were present, including masses on the left shoulder, neck, and left upper leg. A venous-access port was in place in the chest wall on the right side. The abdominal incision was well healed. A Foley catheter was in place, and there was pink-tinged urine. A faint rash was present on the lower abdomen at the site of previous radiation therapy. Edema was present in both legs. Laboratory test results from the current hospital admission are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Goiffon: A chest radiograph (Figure 2B) showed abundant metastatic pulmonary nodules. CT of the chest (Figure 2C and 2D), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed that the nodules had increased in size and quantity over a period of 1 month. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.\nDr. Cote: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, a leftward axis, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and intraventricular conduction delay.\nOn the first hospital day, although the patient was receiving a continuous infusion of dextrose, five bolus injections of dextrose and six glasses of orange juice were needed to increase the blood glucose level to more than 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter). On the morning of the second hospital day, the blood glucose level was 42 mg per deciliter (2.3 mmol per liter). Treatment with oral prednisone was initiated.\nA diagnosis was made.",

The patient was discharged home with instructions to continue treatment with insulin, and follow-up was arranged in the endocrinology clinic of another hospital.\nDuring the subsequent 2 years, the patient continued treatment with insulin. Tests for glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), islet antigen 2 (IA-2), and insulin autoantibodies were negative. One year before the current presentation, the patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) obtained by his primary care provider as part of an annual physical examination.\nIn the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported no symptoms, and the examination was normal. The blood AST level was 87 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), the ALT level 158 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the ALP level 468 U per liter (reference range, 55 to 149), and the \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level 1158 U per liter (reference range, 8 to 61). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Samantha G. Harrington: Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant (Figure 1A) showed a normal-appearing gallbladder and common bile duct. The right kidney was partially visualized and had two cysts, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter; the left kidney was not seen. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (Figure 1B and 1C) showed a normal-appearing liver, biliary system, and spleen. The pancreatic head and neck were smaller than expected, and the body and tail of the pancreas were absent. There were multiple bilateral simple kidney cysts, ranging in size from 2 to 18 mm.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Tan: After these imaging studies were obtained, the patient did not return for scheduled follow-up in the gastroenterology clinic. One year later, and 1 week before the current presentation, the patient returned for follow-up. He had no symptoms, and the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The MRCP findings were unchanged from the previous evaluation. The patient was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospital for evaluation of his kidney cysts.\nIn the nephrology clinic, the patient reported that he felt well. He had had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccinations. Medications included insulin degludec and insulin lispro. There were no known drug allergies. He was a senior in high school and worked part-time at a restaurant. He lived in an apartment in a suburban area of New England with his mother and three siblings. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had prediabetes, obesity, and hypertension; his mother and three siblings were healthy. His paternal grandfather, maternal grandfather, and maternal great-grandfather had diabetes.\nThe blood pressure was 124/66 mm Hg and the heart rate 76 beats per minute. The weight was 65.5 kg, the height 176 cm, and the BMI 21.2. The examination was normal. Analysis of a freshly voided urine specimen revealed 1+ proteinuria, 2+ glucosuria, and trace ketonuria. Microscopic examination showed one mixed granular cast per low-power field and scattered squamous epithelial cells. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Harrington: Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder showed increased renal parenchymal echogenicity and loss of corticomedullary differentiation in both kidneys. The kidney cysts that had been seen previously were present.\nDr. Tan: A diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Jon S. DuBois: A 29-year-old woman was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for the management of a soft-tissue mass in the head of the pancreas.\nThe patient had been well until 7 weeks before this presentation, when progressive pruritus throughout the body developed, along with nausea, bloating, and watery mustard-colored diarrhea. She had eaten sushi for dinner the previous night. She was evaluated in an urgent care clinic in the southeastern United States; she had recently moved there from New England. An injection of methylprednisolone was administered, and hydroxyzine and diphenoxylate\u2013atropine were prescribed. During the next 3 weeks, the symptoms did not abate and jaundice developed, along with new discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, decreased appetite, and amber-colored urine.\nFour weeks before this presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a local hospital. The alanine aminotransferase level was 327 U per liter (reference range, 1 to 33), the aspartate aminotransferase level 104 U per liter (reference range, 1 to 32), and the total bilirubin level 5.8 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.1 to 1.2). The carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) level was 73 U per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 35). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

The patient was admitted to the local hospital. On the second hospital day, results of liver-function tests improved, and she was discharged home with plans for an outpatient evaluation with a gastroenterologist.\nHowever, the next day, the patient flew back to New England and presented to the emergency department of a second hospital for further evaluation. On evaluation, she described persistent diffuse pruritus, nausea, right upper abdominal pain, and mustard-colored diarrhea. She also reported fatigue, unintentional weight loss of 3.2 kg during the past month, and poor sleep.\nThe patient had a history of anxiety and depression. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. Aside from her recent move to the southeastern United States and trip back to New England, there was no recent travel. She worked seasonally as an official at sporting events. She smoked cigarettes occasionally, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs. Her family history included colon cancer in her maternal grandmother, maternal grandfather, and paternal grandmother; breast cancer in her maternal aunt and paternal aunt; and thyroid cancer in her father. In addition, her maternal grandmother had diabetes, and both grandmothers had coronary artery disease.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 155/82 mm Hg, the pulse 94 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was thin and appeared jaundiced, with scleral icterus. She had diffuse excoriations from scratching. The bowel sounds were normal. There was mild tenderness in the right upper abdomen on palpation, but masses and hepatosplenomegaly were not detected. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe alanine aminotransferase level was 85 U per liter, the aspartate aminotransferase level 267 U per liter, and the total bilirubin level 6.7 mg per deciliter. The CA 19-9 level was 79 U per milliliter. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The abdominal CT images obtained at the first hospital were reviewed, and additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Avinash Kambadakone: CT of the abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed diffuse dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts, as well as dilatation of the pancreatic ducts. The dilated ducts terminated abruptly in the pancreatic head. There was a hypodense pancreatic mass at the site of duct obstruction. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (Figure 1C and 1D) also revealed dilatation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, which narrowed abruptly at the level of the pancreatic head, with a heterogeneously enhancing mass at the site of obstruction.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Pancreatic Imaging Studies.\nDr. DuBois: The patient was admitted to the second hospital. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a stricture in the bile duct at the level of the mass, and a stent was placed. The bilirubin level initially decreased, but pruritus and diarrhea persisted. By the seventh hospital day, the bilirubin level had increased to 12.6 mg per deciliter and the CA 19-9 level had increased to 959 U per milliliter. Additional diagnostic testing was performed.\nDr. Kambadakone: Endoscopic ultrasonography (Figure 1E) revealed a hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic head. Fine-needle aspiration was performed.\nDr. DuBois: The aspirate showed variably atypical epithelium, but the quantity and quality of the findings were insufficient for definitive diagnosis. Given the uncertain diagnosis and the possibility of cancer, a surgical consultation was obtained. Surgical removal of the mass was recommended to establish the definitive diagnosis, but the patient declined surgery. Prednisone was administered, and the pruritus and diarrhea abated. On the 20th hospital day, the patient was discharged with plans for an outpatient follow-up evaluation with a gastroenterologist.\nThree days after discharge from the second hospital, the patient was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. At that time, her symptoms had resolved, the results of liver-function tests were normal, and the CA 19-9 level had decreased to 80 U per milliliter. IgG levels (total and subclasses) were normal, and tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were negative. The possibility of cancer was explained to the patient, and surgical removal of the mass was again recommended, but the patient declined surgery owing to multiple issues related to her work and personal life. A management plan that was acceptable to the patient was adopted during the next 6 months. The patient was closely monitored, and biliary stents were changed when they became occluded. Additional diagnostic procedures were performed, and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Yanki Okuducu (Pediatrics): A newborn girl was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of this hospital because of cardiorespiratory arrest at delivery.\nThe newborn\u2019s mother was a 19-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 1) with a history of hepatitis C virus infection. Pregnancy was complicated by urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection that was treated in the second trimester, as well as gestational hypertension. Serial ultrasound surveys of the fetal anatomy performed between 20 weeks 1 day of gestation and 39 weeks 6 days of gestation revealed dilatation of the urinary tract on the right side. Ultrasonography of the fetal heart was normal.\nAt 40 weeks 0 days of gestation, spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred, and the newborn\u2019s mother was admitted to this hospital. Fetal heart tracings indicated nonreassuring fetal status, and at 22 hours 39 minutes of labor, a cesarean section was performed. The uterus was incised, and the amniotic fluid was noted to be stained with meconium. Six minutes later, the newborn was delivered; she was in a breech position at delivery. The birth weight was 3575 g (62nd percentile), the length 50 cm (42nd percentile), and the head circumference 35.5 cm (72nd percentile).\nThe newborn had limp tone and no respiratory effort. Ventilatory support was initiated, and the trachea was intubated. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed. Doses of epinephrine were administered through the endotracheal tube and an umbilical venous catheter, as were boluses of normal saline. After 16 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The Apgar scores at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes were 1, 0, 0, 1, and 3, respectively. The newborn was admitted to the NICU.\nOn the patient\u2019s arrival in the NICU, the axillary temperature was 34.9\u00b0C, the heart rate 141 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 84/59 mm Hg. The oxygen saturation was 97% while she was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in pressure-control mode. A course of therapeutic hypothermia was initiated.\nDr. Evan J. Zucker: Chest radiography (Figure 1A) revealed a small-to-moderate pneumothorax in the medial aspect of the pleural cavity on the right side. Subtle lucency in the middle-to-lower thorax was present on the left side, a finding attributed to a possible left pneumothorax or air trapping.\nFIGURE 1\n\nChest Radiographs.\nDr. Okuducu: Needle thoracentesis was performed on the right side, and 20 ml of air was removed. Empirical treatment with ampicillin and ceftazidime was started. On day 2, increased work of breathing developed, and additional imaging was performed.\nDr. Zucker: Repeat chest radiography (Figure 1B) showed resolution of the right pneumothorax and development of a large left pneumothorax with extensive collapse of the left lung. Needle thoracentesis was performed on the left side, and 27 ml of air was removed. Chest radiography performed after thoracentesis (Figure 1C) showed that the left pneumothorax had decreased in size and inflation of the left lung had increased.\nDr. Angela R. Shih: Pathological examination of the placenta revealed meconium-stained membranes. There was evidence of acute chorioamnionitis with fetal vascular involvement and bacterial organisms on and in the membranes.\nDr. Okuducu: During the next 2 days, the difference between the preductal oxygen saturation and the postductal oxygen saturation ranged from 5 to 15 percentage points, a finding suggestive of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. The fraction of inspired oxygen on the mechanical ventilator was increased to 1.0, and the administration of inhaled nitric oxide was initiated. Hypotension was treated with fluid resuscitation, and dopamine and milrinone infusions were started. Empirical treatment with vancomycin was also started.\nOn transthoracic echocardiography, biventricular systolic function was at the low end of the normal range, and the right ventricle was moderately enlarged. A patent ductus arteriosus (measuring 2.9 mm in diameter), a midmuscular ventricular septal defect (measuring 2.0 mm in diameter), and a patent foramen ovale (measuring 2.5 mm in diameter) were present; each of these features was associated with bidirectional shunting. Tricuspid regurgitation (peak gradient, 58 mm Hg; arterial blood pressure, 66/36 mm Hg) and ventricular septal flattening were present, findings suggestive of elevated right ventricular pressure due to pulmonary hypertension.\nUltrasonography of the kidneys and bladder revealed severe dilatation of the urinary tract on the right side; the left kidney was normal. The patient had an episode of rhythmic myoclonic jerking of the left leg that progressed to shaking of the left leg and arm, and phenobarbital was administered. Electroencephalography confirmed that a seizure originating in the midline posterior region had occurred. The seizure had lasted 25 minutes and had resolved spontaneously before the administration of phenobarbital. Ultrasonography of the head was normal.\nOn day 4, the patient completed the 72-hour course of therapeutic hypothermia, and rewarming began. The blood pressure decreased. The milrinone infusion was gradually discontinued, the dopamine infusion dose was increased, an epinephrine infusion was started, and hydrocortisone was administered. The newborn had episodes of agitation that were associated with labile oxygen saturation. Chest radiography showed that the left pneumothorax had continued to decrease in size; patchy opacities were seen throughout the right lung. Transthoracic echocardiography showed depressed right ventricular function.\nDuring the next week, the pressor dose was increased. The periods of decreased oxygen saturation became more frequent and more prolonged, and ventilatory support was increased. On day 11, the oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in pressure-control mode (peak inspiratory pressure, 31 cm of water; positive end-expiratory pressure, 9 cm of water; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0), along with inhaled nitric oxide. Empirical therapy with vancomycin, ampicillin, and ceftazidime was stopped after the patient completed 10-day courses.\nOn day 16, the axillary temperature increased to 38.8\u00b0C. Chest radiography showed an opacity in the left lower lobe and a small left pleural effusion, as well as linear opacities in both upper lobes. Empirical treatment with oxacillin and gentamicin was started. On day 19, ventilatory support remained elevated, and empirical antibiotic therapy was transitioned to vancomycin and cefepime.\nDr. Zucker: On day 21, repeat chest radiography (Figure 1D) showed a persistent opacity in the left lower lobe. Empirical therapy with vancomycin was discontinued.\nDr. Okuducu: A diagnostic test was performed.",

He was treated with a wide local excision; a biopsy of the sentinel lymph node was negative for melanoma. One year before the current evaluation, the patient began to have slurred speech and weakness in the left hand. Imaging revealed a mass lesion in the parietal lobe of the brain and another mass in the hilum of the left lung. Craniotomy with resection of the brain mass was performed; pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with melanoma, as did a biopsy of the lung mass. Seizures developed postoperatively, and treatment with levetiracetam was initiated. Further treatment included radiation therapy targeting the parietal resection cavity and the administration of pembrolizumab.\nFour months before the current evaluation, after seven cycles of pembrolizumab, the blood thyrotropin level was 9.4 \u03bcIU per milliliter (reference range, 0.4 to 5.0) and the free thyroxine level 0.9 ng per deciliter (12 pmol per liter; reference range, 0.9 to 1.8 ng per deciliter [12 to 23 pmol per liter]); treatment with levothyroxine was initiated. Three months before the current evaluation, after eight cycles of pembrolizumab, exertional angina developed, and the patient underwent coronary catheterization with placement of two drug-eluting stents. Pembrolizumab treatment was resumed 1 month later.\nWhen the patient presented to the oncology clinic for a planned infusion of pembrolizumab, he reported a 3-week history of fatigue and a 2-week history of increased thirst and nocturia, with a need to urinate as many as three times each night. Although there was no change in appetite or eating habits, he had lost 5 kg of weight in the previous 3 weeks. There was no headache or change in vision.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the blood pressure 128/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.0. Heart sounds were regular, with no murmur. Lung sounds were normal. There was no leg edema. Muscle bulk was normal, as was strength in the arms and legs. There was no rash, bruising, or change in skin tone. Other history included hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, levetiracetam, levothyroxine, metoprolol, and pembrolizumab. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.

    "user_input": "Dr. Kevin S. Oh (Radiation Oncology): A 45-year-old woman was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital because of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.\nThe patient had been well until 6 years before the current presentation, when she noticed a mass in the right breast. She was evaluated in the oncology clinic of another hospital, and mammography and ultrasonography of the right breast confirmed the presence of a mass. A core-needle biopsy was performed, and pathological examination of the specimen revealed invasive ductal carcinoma with no lymphovascular invasion. Lumpectomy of the right breast, along with sentinel-node biopsy of the right axilla, was performed.\nDr. Baris Boyraz: Pathological examination of the specimen that was obtained by means of lumpectomy confirmed the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient\u2019s tumor was grade 3 (measuring 2.5 cm in diameter), negative for estrogen receptor, weakly positive (<5% of tumor cells) for progesterone receptor, and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), findings consistent with a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer. Three sentinel lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma, and there was no lymphovascular invasion. Genetic testing revealed no pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.\nDr. Oh: The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, followed by radiation therapy to the right breast. During the subsequent 3.5 years, surveillance imaging showed no evidence of disease recurrence.\nEighteen months before the current presentation, weakness and numbness developed in the left arm and resolved spontaneously after 15 minutes. During the subsequent 4 weeks, the patient had similar episodes of left-arm weakness and numbness, which occurred 1 or 2 times per week. When the episodes did not abate, she sought evaluation in the emergency department of the other hospital. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Karen Rodriguez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a partially cystic mass in the right precentral gyrus. The mass measured 3.5 cm in diameter, with peripheral enhancement and local mass effect.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Head and Chest.\nDr. Oh: The patient was transferred to this hospital for neurosurgical management. The episodes of arm weakness and numbness were attributed to seizures; treatment with dexamethasone and levetiracetam was started. Right frontal craniotomy was performed, and the mass was resected.\nDr. Boyraz: Pathological examination of tissue obtained from the resected mass (Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C) revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive mitotic and apoptotic activity. The tumor cells had patchy positivity for GATA-3, a transcription factor expressed by breast tissue, which supported a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma originating in the breast. Further studies revealed the tumor to be estrogen-receptor\u2013negative and progesterone-receptor\u2013negative, with a HER2 score on immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of 1+ (incomplete, faint membrane staining in >10% of tumor cells), and programmed death ligand 1 expression of less than 1%, findings that are consistent with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Next-generation sequencing revealed variants in FOXL2, CCND3, TP53, and FLT3. An RNA fusion assay did not show fusion transcripts.\nFIGURE 2\n\nBiopsy Specimens of the Brain Mass and Lung.\nDr. Rodriguez: Positron-emission tomography\u2013computed tomography (PET-CT) (Figure 1B and 1C), performed after the administration of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, showed a conglomerate lymph-node mass in the right perihilar region with intense FDG avidity.\nDr. Oh: After surgery, the patient had an uneventful recovery, and the episodes of weakness and numbness resolved. She was discharged home with planned follow-up in the oncology clinic. Radiation therapy was administered to the brain, and treatment with capecitabine was initiated. However, 11 months before the current presentation, the episodes recurred. The dose of levetiracetam was increased, and additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Rodriguez: MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple new enhancing lesions with features consistent with metastasis, including a lesion in the right occipital lobe that measured 3 mm in diameter. Postsurgical changes related to the craniotomy on the right side and the resection of the mass in the right precentral gyrus were also present.\nDr. Oh: Stereotactic radiosurgery to the right occipital metastasis was performed.\nDr. Rodriguez: Seven months before the current presentation, PET-CT, performed after the administration of FDG tracer, showed an increase in the size of the right perihilar mass with intense FDG avidity, as well as new FDG avidity in a right lower paratracheal lymph node.\nDr. Oh: Treatment with capecitabine was discontinued. The patient was enrolled in a clinical trial, and treatment with oral paclitaxel was initiated (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03326102).\nDr. Rodriguez: Five months before the current presentation, MRI of the head revealed a new enhancing lesion in the right superior frontal gyrus, measuring 7 mm in diameter. The right occipital lesion was not seen.\nDr. Oh: The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to the right frontal metastasis. During the subsequent 5 months, treatment with oral paclitaxel was continued.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, nonproductive cough developed. There was no shortness of breath, orthopnea, or chest pain. The patient had not had additional episodes of weakness and numbness in the left arm, and no headache or vision changes had occurred.\nOther medical history included depression. Medications included oral paclitaxel, levetiracetam, paroxetine, prochlorperazine as needed for nausea, lorazepam as needed for anxiety, and acetaminophen as needed for musculoskeletal pain. Penicillin had caused rash. The patient was a teacher and lived with her husband and two children in a rural area of New England. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her maternal grandmother had died of leukemia, and her paternal grandfather had died of prostate cancer.\nAt the current presentation, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/73 mm Hg, the heart rate 67 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were well-healed craniotomy and lumpectomy scars. The breasts had no skin changes, masses, or tenderness. There was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was normal. The complete blood count and the results of kidney-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, and globulin. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Rodriguez: MRI of the head revealed a new peripherally enhancing lesion in the left precentral gyrus, measuring 6 mm in diameter, as well as a new enhancing lesion in the right superior frontal gyrus, measuring 1 mm in diameter. Full-body PET-CT, performed after the administration of FDG tracer, showed enlargement of the conglomerate lymph-node mass in the right perihilar region, which was encasing the bronchus of the right upper lobe and occluding the bronchus of the right middle lobe. In addition, there was severe narrowing of the right superior pulmonary vein.\nDr. Oh: Treatment with oral paclitaxel was stopped, and the patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to the metastasis involving the left frontal lobe.\nManagement decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Danielle C. Crabtree (Medicine): A 37-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, myalgia, jaundice, and hypoxemia.\nThe patient had been healthy until 9 days before this admission, when malaise, fatigue, and generalized weakness developed. The symptoms were severe, and he slept almost all day and night. Seven days before this admission, the patient had an oral temperature of 39.4\u00b0C, and headache developed, as well as achiness and stiffness in the arms, shoulders, knees, and legs. He was not able to eat a full meal because of decreased appetite and nausea. He did not have abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea.\nFive days before this admission, the fever and headache abated; however, the achiness increased, and the patient noticed that his urine was dark yellow. Three days before this admission, the patient sought evaluation in the urgent care clinic of another hospital. Testing was negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus types A and B. He was instructed to get adequate rest and hydration. Two days before this admission, the symptoms had not abated, and the patient returned to the urgent care clinic. On examination, new yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes was observed, and he was instructed to go to the emergency department of the other hospital.\nOn evaluation, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 106/70 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The white-cell count was 17,900 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the platelet count 34,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000), and the hemoglobin level 15.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.0 to 17.0). The creatinine level was 3.0 mg per deciliter (265 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.4 mg per deciliter [53 to 124 \u03bcmol per liter]), the total bilirubin level 15.9 mg per deciliter (272 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.0 to 1.2 mg per deciliter [0 to 21 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the direct bilirubin level more than 10.0 mg per deciliter (171 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.0 to 0.5 mg per deciliter [0 to 9 \u03bcmol per liter]).

The creatinine level increased to 3.8 mg per deciliter (336 \u03bcmol per liter), the hemoglobin level decreased to 10.3 g per deciliter, and the total bilirubin level increased to 20.9 mg per deciliter (357 \u03bcmol per liter). Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula, and boluses of intravenous fluids were given. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported exhaustion and shortness of breath but no cough, rhinorrhea, or congestion. He had no known medical conditions, took no medications, and had no known drug allergies. He lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with his partner, who had had an acute illness characterized by fever, malaise, nausea, and diarrhea that began 7 days before this admission and resolved after 4 days.\nThe patient worked in an office, and he took daily walks with his dog through the woods and along a river; he recalled receiving multiple insect bites during these walks. He reported no recent travel. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 16 years and used marijuana daily. He consumed two alcoholic drinks at a time, a few times per week, and he did not use illicit drugs.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/56 mm Hg, the pulse 103 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 42 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He was alert and oriented but appeared ill. He had increased work of breathing, with the use of accessory muscles of respiration; diffuse rales were heard in both lungs. There was no abdominal tenderness, hepatosplenomegaly, asterixis, or leg swelling. Marked scleral icterus and jaundiced skin were present, but he had no conjunctival suffusion, rash, or ulcers. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Ryan Chung: Radiography of the chest revealed bilateral, predominantly peripheral, patchy opacities (Figure 1A). Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed hyperechogenic and prominent portal triads with a \u201cstarry sky\u201d appearance; there was no biliary ductal dilatation or hydronephrosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities with tree-in-bud nodularity in both lungs (Figure 1B and 1C), as well as small pleural effusions and enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes (Figure 1D). No hepatic lesions, biliary ductal dilatation, or hepatosplenomegaly were noted (Figure 1E).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.\nDr. Crabtree: The patient started treatment with continuous positive airway pressure.

Chen: A 34-year-old woman was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital for the management of relapsed, metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\nThe patient had been well until 3 years before this evaluation, when acute abdominal and back pain developed, and she presented to the emergency department of another hospital. As part of the evaluation, abdominal ultrasonography was performed and reportedly revealed a lesion in the right lobe of the liver. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Theodore T. Pierce: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a heterogeneous, hypoenhancing, lobulated lesion that measured 6.1 cm by 4.5 cm (Figure 1A), with imaging characteristics suggestive of primary or metastatic cancer. The lesion was associated with peripheral biliary dilatation, which suggested biliary obstruction (Figure 1B); restricted diffusion, indicating high tissue density (Figure 1C); peripheral rim enhancement on arterial phase imaging, reflecting increased vascularity at the rim of the lesion (Figure 1D); and delayed enhancement of the more central areas of the lesion, indicating fibrosis (Figure 1E and 1F). Taken together, these features are atypical of benign lesions, such as hemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatic adenoma, and are most consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial MRI of the Liver.\nPositron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT), performed after the administration of intravenous 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed FDG avidity in the hepatic mass in the right lobe.

The level of CA 19-9 was elevated, at 110 IU per milliliter (reference value, <35), but the levels of alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal. An ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy of the liver mass in the right lobe was performed, and management decisions were made.",

The headaches became less severe after the patient took acetaminophen. He had no associated nausea, vomiting, or neck pain.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, paresthesia developed in the fingertips and, over the course of several days, extended to the hands and then the forearms. One week before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The temporal temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 134/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.9. He had no rash. Sensation to light touch and pinprick was absent from the toes to the midfoot.\nScreening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C viruses, and Lyme disease were negative. The blood level of folate was greater than 20 ng per milliliter (45 nmol per liter; reference value, >4.6 ng per milliliter [>10 nmol per liter]), the vitamin B1 (thiamine) level 149.1 nmol per liter (reference range, 66.5 to 200), and the vitamin B12 (cobalamin) level 235 pg per milliliter (173 pmol per liter; reference range, 232 to 1245 pg per milliliter [171 to 919 pmol per liter]). Testing for anti\u2013myelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies was negative. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Saurabh Rohatgi: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1) was performed. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, obtained before the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed mild, nonspecific, scattered foci of hyperintensity involving the supratentorial white matter; the dominant lesion, which was located in the right frontal centrum semiovale and corona radiata, measured 1.4 cm in diameter. No associated abnormal enhancement was seen on images obtained after the administration of contrast material.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Pullarkat: The patient was referred to a neurology clinic. One week later, while the patient was awaiting an appointment in the neurology clinic, paresthesia extended into the thighs and torso. The patient was advised by his primary care physician to present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported worsening paresthesia and loss of dexterity in his hands. He was no longer able to play guitar. He had no motor weakness, bowel or bladder incontinence, or double vision. There was no change in sensation in his face or in articulation of his speech, and he had no dysphonia, dysphagia, or shortness of breath.\nOther medical history included depression and chronic knee and ankle pain after trauma. Medications included bupropion and mirtazapine. There were no known allergies. The patient was a graduate student and lived with several roommates. He was sexually active with women. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 11 years before quitting 4 years before the current presentation. He had consumed three alcoholic drinks daily for many years, but 1 month before the current presentation, he had reduced consumption to two drinks one or two times per week. He used intranasal cocaine three or four times per week and inhaled nitrous oxide once per week. He had last used lysergic acid diethylamide and ketamine 10 weeks before the current presentation during a camping trip in rural New England; there were ticks in the area where he had camped, but he had not found any ticks on his body. The patient had a normal diet with no dietary restrictions, and there was no history of diarrhea or unintentional weight loss. His maternal grandfather had diabetes, and his paternal grandfather had gastric cancer.\nThe patient was alert and interactive and followed commands. The temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. He had a flat affect but was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. Muscle tone and strength were normal. In the legs, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the toes to the hips and flanks, with sparing of the anterior trunk and the back. In the arms, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the fingers to the shoulders. The reduced sensation was most pronounced in the fingers and toes. Vibratory sensation and proprioception were decreased below the shins. The reflexes were 2+ in the arms but were absent in the legs. The patient was able to touch the tip of his nose with his index finger when his eyes were open but was unable to do so when his eyes were closed.

    "user_input": "Dr. Diana L. Stern (Psychiatry): A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of depression, recurrent falls, and difficulty caring for herself.\nFour years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of depression that was precipitated by psychosocial stressors. She was treated with bupropion, citalopram, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The depression was well controlled until 1 year before the current admission, when she began to have anhedonia, decreased energy, sadness, and poor concentration. She resumed cognitive behavioral therapy, but her symptoms worsened during the next 4 months, and she had suicidal ideation. The dose of bupropion was increased, and treatment with trazodone was started.\nFourteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident that was attributed to her falling asleep while driving. After the accident, she reported increased sadness, low energy, and inability to perform her usual activities. One week later, she fell and struck her head, and she was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that, before her fall, she had been feeling unsteady because of weakness in the left leg. A physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hypodensities involving the subcortical and periventricular white matter, findings consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital and was discharged home.\nDuring the next week, the patient had balance difficulties and began using a walker. When she was evaluated in the neurology clinic, she reported imbalance and occasional nausea. On examination, she had a depressed affect. Strength was assessed as 5\u2212/5 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, and patellar tendons and were absent at the ankles, with downgoing toes. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with mild dragging of the left leg. A diagnosis of postconcussive syndrome was considered, and treatment with ondansetron was started for nausea. Additional tests were performed.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased signal intensity in the pons and in a periventricular distribution on T2-weighted imaging, without associated contrast enhancement. There was a region of decreased signal intensity in the right corona radiata on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Results of electroencephalography were normal, as were results of electromyography and nerve-conduction studies of the left leg. Physical therapy was recommended, and repeat MRI was planned for 6 weeks later.\nOver the next 6-week period, during sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, the patient was noted to be less talkative, with slow processing, impaired recall, and mild inattention. Repeat MRI with angiography performed 6 weeks after the first study revealed patchy hyperintensity involving the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, and corticospinal tract bilaterally on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, without contrast enhancement; the cerebral vasculature was normal.\nThe patient had recurrent falls without loss of consciousness and began using a wheelchair. She reported worsening sadness, anxiety, and anhedonia, and treatment with buspirone was started. On evaluation in the neurology clinic 6 weeks before the current admission, testing of leg strength yielded inconsistent results, but strength in both legs was assessed as 5\u2212/5 with maximum effort. Dragging of the left leg was also noted to be inconsistent. There were concerns that her depression might be contributing to her neurologic changes, and further follow-up with the psychiatric service was recommended.\nFive weeks before the current admission, the patient\u2019s husband brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for an evaluation of worsening memory impairment, poor self-care, and frequent falls. The patient had stopped participating in physical therapy and was spending most of the day in bed. She reported that she had lost 14 kg during the previous 4 months. Other medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and osteoarthritis of the knees. There was a history of postpartum depression 27 years earlier that had lasted for several months. Medications included amlodipine, buspirone, bupropion, cholecalciferol, citalopram, metformin, and trazodone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband in a suburb of Boston and worked as a teacher. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol only occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of anxiety and depression in her seventh decade of life. Her sister had a history of stroke.\nOn examination, the patient appeared tired and disheveled, with psychomotor retardation. Strength in both legs was assessed as 5/5. She had a monoplegic gait, with buckling of the left leg, when walking down a hallway, but she had a normal gait when walking on a treadmill. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 25, indicating mild cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The complete blood count, results of liver-function and kidney-function tests, and blood levels of cobalamin, thyrotropin, and electrolytes were normal. Screening for syphilis, Lyme disease, and the human immunodeficiency virus was negative, as was urine toxicologic screening. After an evaluation by a neurology consultant, the patient was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit.\nWhile the patient was in the hospital, the dose of citalopram was tapered, and treatment with desvenlafaxine and amphetamine\u2013dextroamphetamine was started; her levels of attention and wakefulness increased. She participated in group psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational and physical therapy. She continued to have variable weakness in the left leg and had three witnessed falls, during which she reportedly had fatigue and lowered herself to the ground.\nOn hospital day 11, the patient reported being unable to use her left arm because of weakness. Although her left arm rested across her chest for most of the day, she was observed holding her husband\u2019s hand with her left hand when saying goodbye. On evaluation by a neurology consultant, strength in the left arm was assessed as 5/5. The working diagnosis was functional neurologic disorder. On hospital day 12, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center.\nAt the rehabilitation center, the patient received physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medications to treat depression. During the first week, she made progress toward independence in bathing, toileting, and grooming but had limited attention, memory, and problem solving. During the second week, she became more withdrawn. There was a paucity of speech with hypophonia, decreased attention, and less eye contact with visitors who sat on her left side than with visitors who sat on her right side. During the third week, the patient stopped answering questions and following commands. She was evaluated again in the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/90 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was withdrawn and minimally interactive. She was able to state her name but not the date or location. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side and did not track the examiner\u2019s finger past the midline to the left. There was flattening of the left nasolabial fold. The left arm was hypertonic and held in flexion; there was no spontaneous movement of the left arm or leg, and she declined to participate in a strength examination. She did not withdraw the left arm in response to nail-bed pressure; she withdrew the left foot with antigravity movement in response to tactile stimulation.\nThe white-cell count was 12,940 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with a normal differential count. The remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

Two weeks later, the diarrhea increased in frequency and became bloody. The patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 63/32 mm Hg, the hemoglobin level 6.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), the international normalized ratio 7.63 (reference range, 0.90 to 1.10), the creatinine level 1.4 mg per deciliter (124 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.5 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [44 to 115 \u03bcmol per liter]), the alkaline phosphatase level 330 U per liter (reference range, 56 to 136), the albumin level 1.4 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.5), and the lactate level 3.3 mmol per liter (30 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]). Normal saline, albumin, norepinephrine, fresh-frozen plasma, vitamin K, 4 units of packed red cells, vancomycin, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, octreotide, and pantoprazole were administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of oral contrast material, reportedly revealed ground-glass opacities in the lungs, pulmonary nodules, esophageal dilatation, and diffuse osteopenia, along with ascites, hepatic steatosis, diffuse bowel-wall thickening, dilated loops of small bowel, and horseshoe kidney. A heterogeneous mass, measuring 11 cm by 8 cm by 7 cm, with internal necrosis was identified near the pancreatic tail. Abdominal ultrasonography reportedly showed a cirrhotic-appearing liver and ascites. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was reportedly notable for severe esophagitis but showed no source of acute bleeding.\nDuring the first 7 hospital days, diarrhea continued, with an output of up to 2 liters of green liquid stool daily. Examination of a stool specimen was reportedly positive for leukocytes and negative for Clostridioides difficile and Shiga toxin, as well as campylobacter, giardia, and cryptosporidium antigens.\nOn hospital day 7, anuria occurred, and the bladder pressure was 23 mm Hg. Paracentesis was performed for the treatment of abdominal distention, and 3.7 liters of ascitic fluid was removed. Testing of the ascitic fluid revealed 14,000 erythrocytes per microliter and 91 neutrophils per microliter. The albumin level in ascitic fluid was 0.3 g per deciliter; the concurrent serum albumin level was 3.2 g per deciliter. No organisms were detected on Gram\u2019s staining of the ascitic fluid. Norepinephrine and albumin were administered intravenously.\nThe next day, there was an output of copious black stool. The hemoglobin level decreased from 8.1 g per deciliter to 5.1 g per deciliter; additional norepinephrine was administered intravenously, along with 4 units of packed red cells, cryoprecipitate, vitamin K, and fresh-frozen plasma. Intubation of the trachea was performed for repeat EGD, which reportedly revealed a pulsatile vascular lesion in the distal esophagus; blood was detected around the lesion. Octreotide and pantoprazole were administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to the ICU of this hospital.\nBecause the patient had undergone intubation, the medical history was initially obtained from her husband and was limited. Celiac disease had been diagnosed in her late 30s, but she did not follow a gluten-free diet. Her one pregnancy had been complicated by severe gestational hypertension, with delivery by cesarean section performed at 33 weeks\u2019 gestation. Menopause had occurred in her mid-40s. Recurrent otitis media had led to tympanic membrane perforation and resultant chronic hearing loss. In the past year, she had lost 7 kg of weight unintentionally. In the 2 weeks before she was admitted to the other hospital, after the onset of diarrhea, she had had a decreased appetite and had eaten only candy and cereal, with 2 kg of weight loss.\nThe patient attended college and worked as a technical consultant. She lived with her husband. She had no history of nicotine, alcohol, or illicit substance use. She took no medications or supplements, and there were no known adverse reactions to medications. Her family history included stroke in her father, colon cancer in her paternal grandfather, and pancreatic cancer in a paternal great-grandfather and a paternal aunt. She had an adult child, who was healthy.\nOn examination in the ICU, the patient appeared chronically ill. The temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 91 beats per minute, the blood pressure 102/67 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 98% while she was receiving mechanical ventilation on a spontaneous-breathing mode (positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; fraction of inspired oxygen, 35%). The height was 142 cm, the weight 50.6 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.1. The bladder pressure was 12 mm Hg. The sclerae were icteric, and the skin was jaundiced. The corners of the mouth were inflamed, erythematous, and crusted. The abdomen was distended, and a fluid wave was present. The palmar surfaces appeared mildly erythematous and denuded, and there were pigmented nevi on the back and shoulder. Symmetric 1+ pitting edema was observed in the lower legs.\nThe calcium and phosphorus levels were normal. Tests for hepatitis A antibodies, hepatitis B surface antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigens, hepatitis B core antibodies, hepatitis C antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and liver\u2013kidney\u2013microsomal autoantibodies type 1 were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Stool was obtained for culture and examination for ova and parasites. Albumin, 2 units of packed red cells, ceftriaxone, propofol, pantoprazole, and octreotide were administered intravenously.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Admission, Hospital Day 2, Hospital Day 3\n\nBlood:\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201316.0, 13.2, 11.0, 14.7\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 38.3, 31.4, 41.1\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 15,290, 8260, 13,470\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 79,000, 71,000, 105,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 142, 142, 141\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 4.1, 3.9, 3.7\nChloride (mmol/liter), 100\u2013108, 113, 114, 113\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 13, 15, 13\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 3, 4, 5\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.53, 0.54, 0.65\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 98, 98, 69\nMagnesium (mg/dl), 1.7\u20132.4, 0.6, 1.8, 1.9\nTotal protein (g/dl), 4.3\u20138.0, 4.3, 4.3, 4.0\nLactate (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.0, 2.6, 1.7, 1.6\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 19.2, 21.9, 20.2\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.6, 1.9, 1.7\nFibrinogen (mg/dl), 150\u2013400, 192, 128, 133\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 3.2, \u2014, 3.1\nGlobulin (g/dl), 1.9\u20134.1, 1.1, \u2014, 0.9\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201333, 18, \u2014, 16\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201332, 27, \u2014, 25\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 30\u2013100, 68, \u2014, 72\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 10.1, \u2014, 6.2\nDirect bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20130.4, 4.7, \u2014, 3.9\nCA 19\u20139 (U/ml), <35, 26, \u2014, \u2014\nIron (\u00b5g/dl), 30\u2013160, \u2014, 86, \u2014\nIron-binding capacity (\u00b5g/dl), 230\u2013404, \u2014, 93, \u2014\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), 10\u2013200, \u2014, 50, \u2014\nFolate (ng/ml), >4.7, \u2014, 2.2, \u2014\nVitamin B\u2081 (nmol/liter), 70\u2013180, \u2014, 120, \u2014\nVitamin B\u2083 (\u00b5g/ml), 0.50\u20138.45, \u2014, 1.83, \u2014\nVitamin B\u2081\u2082 (pg/ml), >250, \u2014, 1960, \u2014\nIgG (mg/dl), 614\u20131295, \u2014, 412, \u2014\nIgA (mg/dl), 69\u2013309, \u2014, 140, \u2014\nIgM (mg/dl), 53\u2013334, \u2014, 56, \u2014\nSerum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation, Normal pattern; no M component, \u2014, Mild, diffuse decrease in gamma globulin; no M component, \u2014\nAntinuclear antibody, Negative at 1:80 and 1:160, \u2014, Positive at 1:40; speckled, \u2014\nAnti\u2013smooth muscle antibody, Negative at 1:20, \u2014, Positive at 1:20, \u2014\nAlpha\u2081-antitrypsin (mg/dl), 90\u2013200, \u2014, 72, \u2014\nCeruloplasmin (mg/dl), 20\u201360, \u2014, 10, \u2014\nAmmonia (\u00b5mol/liter), 12\u201348, \u2014, \u2014, 64\nAnti\u2013tissue transglutaminase IgA (U/ml), 0\u201315, \u2014, \u2014, 40.25\nAnti\u2013gliadin IgA (U/ml), 0\u201315, \u2014, \u2014, 21.19\nAntimitochondrial antibody, Negative at 1:20, \u2014, \u2014, Positive at 1:20\nCopper (\u00b5g/ml), 0.75\u20131.45, \u2014, \u2014, 0.33\nPrealbumin (mg/dl), 20\u201340, \u2014, \u2014, 5\nVitamin A (\u00b5g/dl), 32.5\u201378.0, \u2014, \u2014, <5.0\nVitamin D\u2082 (ng/ml), 20\u201380, \u2014, \u2014, 5\nVitamin E (mg/liter), 5.5\u201317.9, \u2014, \u2014, 1.0\nZinc (\u00b5g/ml), 0.66\u20131.10, \u2014, \u2014, 0.24\n\nStool:\nShiga toxins 1 and 2, Negative, Negative, \u2014, \u2014\nFat (%), <20, \u2014, <20, \u2014\nSodium (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, 88, \u2014\nPotassium (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, 17, \u2014\n\nEGD was performed the next morning (Figure 1). There was a blind-ended submucosal pouch that suggested the possibility of an intramural dissection in the posterior esophagus. Severe esophagitis, cratered esophageal ulcers, and a distal esophageal varix with an overlying fibrin plug were noted. An attempt at esophageal band ligation was unsuccessful, with unroofing of the fibrin clot and active spurting of blood. Two clips were applied for hemostasis. Hematin was found throughout the stomach. The duodenal bulb appeared nodular, and the duodenal mucosa appeared scalloped; a duodenal biopsy was performed. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nFIGURE 1\n\nEGD Images.\nDr. Ranjodh S. Dhami: CT angiography of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed for assessment of the esophageal vessels and possible esophageal perforation (Figure 2). Multiple esophageal, perigastric, and perisplenic varices were present. A 1.8-cm esophageal diverticulum, pneumomediastinum, and foci of air in the retropharyngeal space and other deep spaces of the neck were noted, along with diffuse hepatic steatosis (without morphologic features of cirrhosis), mild splenomegaly, horseshoe kidney, and diffuse thickening of the small and large bowel walls. An enhancing, centrally hypodense left retroperitoneal mass, measuring 10.7 cm in greatest dimension, was present. There was diffuse mottling of bones.\nFIGURE 2\n\nDelayed-Phase Images from CT Angiography.\nDr. Lopes: In the first 24 hours of hospitalization, there was an output of 800 ml of red liquid stool. On hospital day 2, a total of 3 units of packed red cells were administered.

    "user_input": "Dr. Carolina Geadas (Medicine): A 70-year-old man with a history of kidney transplantation was evaluated at this hospital because of multiple erythematous rashes that had developed during an admission for respiratory failure, pneumococcal bacteremia, and kidney failure.\nApproximately 4.5 years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013associated vasculitis after he presented with progressive glomerulonephritis with kidney failure and new hemoptysis. The anti-myeloperoxidase antibody titer was 221.0 U (reference value, <2.8). The patient underwent plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were administered. Hemodialysis was initiated. Two weeks later, rituximab was administered, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were discontinued. During the next 4 years, his renal function did not improve, and treatment with rituximab and hemodialysis was continued.\nFour months before the current admission, the patient underwent transplantation of a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C virus antibody\u2013positive status. After the kidney transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy included a dose of basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and tapering doses of prednisone. The patient had delayed graft function; the blood creatinine level decreased from approximately 4.00 mg per deciliter (354 mmol per liter) immediately after transplantation to 1.50 mg per deciliter (133 mmol per liter) 6 weeks later. Six days before the current admission, at a routine follow-up visit, the creatinine level was 1.33 mg per deciliter (118 mmol per liter).\nFour days before the current admission, the patient began to have central abdominal discomfort, nausea, anorexia, chills, and diarrhea with loose stools three times per day. During the next several days, he noticed decreased urine output and malaise, and he began to have rhinorrhea, cough, sinus congestion, and dyspnea. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems was notable for palpitations and dizziness and was negative for fever, emesis, and hematuria. The patient\u2019s brother had recently received a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for vasculitis with end-stage kidney disease (culminating in kidney transplantation), coronary artery disease (with placement of a stent in the right coronary artery), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cholelithiasis (with cholecystectomy), colonic polyps and diverticulosis, gout, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, hernia (with hernia repair), and spinal stenosis. Medications taken at home included mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, prednisone, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, valganciclovir, warfarin, aspirin, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, and cholecalciferol, as well as lorazepam as needed. Penicillin had caused anaphylaxis.\nThe patient was a retired business owner and lived with family in Boston. He had a remote history of tobacco smoking that totaled 10 pack-years; he had quit smoking approximately 40 years earlier. He did not drink alcohol or use other substances. His family history was notable for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease in his father and siblings. There was no known family history of kidney or autoimmune disease.\nThe temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/56 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air, 92% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 60 liters per minute. On examination, he appeared acutely ill and weak. He had bitemporal cachexia, dry oral mucosa, and increased work of breathing. Auscultation of the chest revealed tachypnea, diminished breath sounds and crackles in the lungs, and tachycardia. There was tenderness in the periumbilical area and the right lower quadrant, at the site of the kidney transplantation; the incision was well healed.\nBlood levels of lipase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine specimens were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed possible sinus tachycardia with right bundle-branch block. Vancomycin and cefepime were administered intravenously. Three hours after presentation, a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was positive, and remdesivir and dexamethasone were administered intravenously.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Initial Evaluation, Hospital Day 4, Hospital Day 14\n\nBlood\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 13.8, 10.1, 7.7\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 41.5, 29.8, 24.0\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 320, 9520, 3250\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l)\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 50, 8580, 3050\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 60, 80, 30\nMonocytes, 200\u20131200, 110, 580, 80\nEosinophils, 0\u2013900, \u2014, 0, 80\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 168,000, 106,000, 35,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 132, 134, 138\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 3.1, 4.8, 4.9\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 95, 101, 103\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 19, 18, 18\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 67, 31, 20\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 4.08, 1.63, 1.02\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 83, 170, 161\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 3.5, 1.8, 2.3\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 18, 190, 36\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201340, 61, 814, 46\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013115, 63, 134, 90\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 1.2, 2.8, 4.4\nDirect bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20130.4, 0.8, 2.2, 4.0\nLactate (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.2, 1.5, 2.4, 2.0\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 56.8, 21.2, 18.4\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 6.8, 1.9, 1.6\nPartial-thromboplastin time (sec), 22.0\u201336.0, \u2014, 76.8, 44.6\nTacrolimus (ng/ml), >2.0, 29.9, 13.1, 3.2\nHigh-sensitivity troponin T (ng/liter), 0\u20139, 105, \u2014, \u2014\nN-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (pg/ml), <900, 63,959, \u2014, \u2014\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), 0.0\u20138.0, 120.4, \u2014, \u2014\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), 20\u2013300, 4261, \u2014, \u2014\nD-dimer (ng/ml), <500, \u2014, 916, \u2014\n\nArterial blood gas\nFraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, \u2014, 0.30, 0.55\npH, 7.35\u20137.45, \u2014, 7.38, 7.31\nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 35\u201342, \u2014, 31, 40\nPartial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 80\u2013100, \u2014, 80, 65\n\nUrine\nColor, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, \u2014\nClarity, Clear, Turbid, Slightly cloudy, \u2014\npH, 5.0\u20139.0, 5.5, 6.0, \u2014\nSpecific gravity, 1.001\u20131.035, 1.019, 1.020, \u2014\nGlucose, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nKetones, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nLeukocyte esterase, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nNitrite, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nBlood, Negative, 2+, 3+, \u2014\nProtein, Negative, 2+, 2+, \u2014\nErythrocytes (per high-power field), 0\u20132, 10\u201320, 20\u201350, \u2014\nLeukocytes (per high-power field), <10, 0, 10\u201320, \u2014\nBacteria, None, 1+, 2+, \u2014\n\nDr. Joseph D. King: Radiography of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed confluent basilar consolidation in the left lung and scattered patchy opacities in the right lung. Ultrasonography that targeted the renal allograft revealed normal renal parenchyma and a trace amount of adjacent free fluid. Doppler ultrasonography (Figure 1B through 1E) showed patent vasculature with normal flow velocities but showed elevated renal arterial resistive indexes, which are suggestive of allograft dysfunction. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1F and 1G), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed confluent consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs, with more extensive findings in the left lung than in the right lung, as well as patchy multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of both lungs and the middle lobe of the right lung. Concurrent CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1H), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was remarkable for only a trace amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant, along the renal allograft.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Geadas: The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital. Phenylephrine was administered intravenously. He could not be weaned from the high-flow nasal cannula; because he had increased work of breathing and tachypnea, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation initiated. Bronchoscopy revealed dark secretions in the lower lobe and lingula of the left lung. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae in four of four bottles. A blood test for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative, and serum levels of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan and galactomannan were undetectable. Azithromycin, cefepime, linezolid, amiodarone, furosemide, and vitamin K were administered intravenously, and valganciclovir and atovaquone were administered orally. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed low-normal ventricular function, atrial enlargement, and no valvular vegetations. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated. ANCA titers were undetectable.\nOn hospital day 3, excoriation and erythema of the buttock and a purpuric plaque on the sacrum were noted (Figure 2A). Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no changes. Punch biopsy of skin on the right buttock was performed. The antibiotic regimen was transitioned to intravenous ceftriaxone.\nFIGURE 2\n\nClinical Photographs.\nThe following day, histologic examination of the skin-biopsy specimen revealed epidermal necrosis, with scattered apoptotic and necrotic keratinocytes and extravasated erythrocytes. No microorganisms were identified, and microbiologic culture of the biopsy specimen was negative. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 4 are shown in Table 1.\nDuring the next 6 days, treatment with continuous venovenous hemofiltration and intravenous ceftriaxone was continued. The level of mechanical ventilation was reduced from mandatory provided breaths to spontaneous ventilation, and the mode was switched to pressure-support ventilation. Repeat blood cultures were negative. On hospital day 11, the patient\u2019s respiratory status worsened; the fraction of inspired oxygen was increased, and a mandatory respiratory rate was reinstituted.\nTwo days later, a new well-circumscribed purpuric patch was noted on the abdomen (Figure 2B). The patch measured 5 cm in greatest dimension and had a hyperpigmented halo but had no fluctuance or crepitus. The next day, a similar-appearing lesion was noted on the right thigh. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 14 are shown in Table 1.\nDr. King: Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed increased consolidative and ground-glass opacities in both lungs.\nDr. Geadas: Ceftriaxone was discontinued, and vancomycin, cefepime, and liposomal amphotericin B were administered intravenously. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Marina Avetisyan (Neurology, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital): A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of rapidly progressive weakness in the right arm and recurrent falls.\nTwelve years before this admission, the patient noted worsening gait and balance disturbance, which slowly progressed, and falls began to occur 5 years before this admission. Her medical history included measles encephalitis, which had been diagnosed when she was 6 years of age and had resulted in weakness on the left side, severe vision and hearing impairment, and gait and balance disturbance. After rehabilitation therapy, her balance and gait apparently normalized, but she had mild residual weakness on the left side, which resulted in a change from left-hand to right-hand dominance.\nTwo years before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She reported difficulties with balance, which worsened with head turning. She reported no disequilibrium, vertigo, back pain, paresthesia, or numbness. On examination, her cognitive function was intact, and although her speech was dysarthric and hypophonic, these abnormalities could have been associated with her hearing loss. The cranial-nerve examination revealed abnormal eye movements, with square-wave jerks, saccadic pursuit, and bilateral horizontal nystagmus. The hearing and vision were severely reduced. The muscle bulk was decreased throughout, and tone was normal. Motor strength was full and symmetric in the arms and legs bilaterally, and contractures were present in the fingers of the left hand. Reflexes were reduced or absent throughout, and plantar reflexes were extensor bilaterally. Vibratory sensation was reduced at the great toes but was otherwise normal. The patient had appendicular dysmetria on both finger-to-nose testing and heel-to-shin testing that was greater on the left side than on the right side. Her gait was wide-based, and she was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg sign was present.\nNeedle electromyographic findings and the results of nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine revealed mild multilevel degenerative disk disease without clinically significant spinal-canal stenosis. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 0 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and oligoclonal bands were absent. Tests of the CSF and serum for antibodies associated with autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis were negative (Table 1).

The patient initially attributed the weakness to fatigue, since it had occurred during a time of increased physical activity associated with moving to a different apartment. However, the weakness did not abate, and 2 months before this admission, she was again evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She noted difficulty with communicating in sign language and with holding objects in her right hand because of weakness and had started using her left hand to eat. She reported no neck, arm, or leg pain and no sensory loss. Her gait and balance were stable, with no recent falls.\nOn examination, there was reduced facial expression and reduced muscle bulk and tone throughout. The right shoulder was dropped, with weakness in the right trapezius and reduced active shoulder abduction that was limited to 70 degrees, without pain on shoulder abduction. There was predominantly proximal weakness in the right arm; the muscle strength was 4\u2212/5 on shoulder abduction and external rotation, 4+/5 on elbow flexion, and 4/5 on elbow extension, wrist extension, and abductor digiti minimi and finger extension. The strength in the right leg was normal. There was subtle weakness on the left side that involved wrist and finger extension and great toe extension. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right biceps and 1+ at the left biceps and were otherwise areflexic throughout. Sensation was intact in the arms, but there was decreased vibratory sensation and proprioception at the great toes; sensation was otherwise normal. Moderate appendicular dysmetria was present in the arms and legs. The patient\u2019s gait, which was assessed while she was using her white cane (the type of cane commonly used by blind or visually impaired persons), was wide-based; she took excessively large steps and reached out once to touch the wall. Neurologic examination was otherwise unchanged from the examination performed 2 years earlier. Additional studies were obtained.\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was reported to be normal. MRI of the cervical spine was also performed without the administration of contrast material; T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed signal hyperintensity in the suboccipital and paraspinal soft tissues that was consistent with edema. Areas of intrinsic hyperintense signal that were consistent with fatty atrophy were seen on T1-weighted imaging. There were diffuse degenerative changes with mild spinal-canal stenosis at C4\u2013C5, without cord compression.\nDr. Avetisyan: Repeat needle electromyography revealed no recorded motor units in the right deltoid or infraspinatus muscles, with complex repetitive discharges in the right cervical paraspinal and deltoid muscles. Nerve-conduction studies revealed mild reduction in the amplitudes of the bilateral median and right ulnar sensory responses; the sensory responses of the right radial, bilateral antebrachial cutaneous, and bilateral medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves were normal, as were the motor responses of the right median and right ulnar nerves.\nDuring the ensuing 2 months, the weakness in the right arm progressed rapidly, which caused the patient to have difficulty ambulating with her white cane (she was unable to walk with a standard cane), making walking unsafe after frequent falls and rendering her practically bedbound. She had no pain or numbness in her arm. She was ultimately unable to care for herself at home and was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation.\nOther medical history included hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism. Medications included ascorbic acid, vitamin B complex, coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, calcium carbonate and cholecalciferol, and levothyroxine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone and worked for a nonprofit agency. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank four glasses of wine per week, and did not use illicit drugs. She reported that her father had died from Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease when he was 71 years of age, 7 months after the onset of symptoms. Her mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which was diagnosed when she was in her 60s; she was currently living in a nursing home. The patient had four siblings; one had died at 46 years of age from an intracerebral hemorrhage, and her remaining three siblings were well.\nOn examination, the temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/64 mm Hg, the pulse 61 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 15.8. The patient appeared emaciated but was able to sit up in a chair and hold her head up. Strength in her right arm had decreased to 2/5 on shoulder shrug, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, and elbow extension, with 3/5 strength on wrist extension and finger flexion and extension. There was new proximal weakness in the right leg, with 4/5 strength on right hip flexion. The strength in the left arm was unchanged. Deep-tendon reflexes were 3+ at the right biceps and 2+ at the brachioradialis and were otherwise absent throughout. She had ataxia as well as occasional jerks that involved the legs (with the left leg affected to a greater extent than the right leg) and were possibly stimulus-induced. The remainder of the neurologic examination was unchanged from the last visit.\nDr. Schaefer: MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a new linear signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging but also a marked decrease in subtle restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging and hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging (identified in retrospect on the previous MRI) in the left frontal and left parietal lobes (Figure 1). MRI of the whole spine, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was unchanged from previous imaging.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Avetisyan: The creatine kinase level was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Bart K. Chwalisz: A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at a hospital affiliated with this hospital because of monocular vision loss.\nTwo months before the current presentation, during the third trimester of the patient\u2019s first pregnancy, headache and decreased vision in the right eye developed. The patient thought that the headache felt like previous migraines, which had been infrequent. However, decreased vision had not been a typical feature of her migraines. Colors appeared dim, and light perception was decreased. There was soreness in the right eye but no pain with eye movement.\nFive days later, the patient was evaluated by an optometrist. She reported that she could see only shapes and movements. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye but no response in the right eye. The patient was instructed to seek evaluation in an emergency department of another hospital.\nIn the emergency department, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, which was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material because of the pregnancy, revealed marked enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve. The nerve appeared isointense as compared with the extraocular muscles on the T1-weighted sequences but appeared bright on the T2-weighted sequence; the globes appeared normal, and the extraocular muscles were not enlarged. The results of magnetic resonance venography of the head were normal.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated for a working diagnosis of optic neuritis. During the hospitalization, her ability to see colors improved slightly, but her vision did not improve; she could see only hand motions. On the fifth hospital day, she was discharged home with instructions to schedule follow-up appointments with a neurologist and an optometrist.\nOne month after discharge from the other hospital and 2 weeks before the current presentation, the patient was again evaluated by her optometrist. The vision in the right eye had worsened; she was no longer able to see shadows or movements. The patient was referred for evaluation by a neuro-ophthalmologist.\nOn the current presentation to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic of a hospital affiliated with this hospital, the patient reported no improvement in vision and ongoing soreness in the right eye. There was a history of Lyme disease, which had been diagnosed during the second trimester of pregnancy and had been treated with amoxicillin. Medications included prenatal vitamins and ferrous sulfate. The patient lived with her husband in New England and worked in health care. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. A brother had a history of childhood epilepsy, and her mother had macular degeneration.\nOn examination, the visual acuity was 20/15 in the left eye, and there was no light perception in the right eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, although the response in the right pupil was sluggish; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the right eye. On the Ishihara color test, all plates were identified with the left eye. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye. The Ishihara color test and the visual field test could not be performed on the right eye because of poor vision. The results of a slit-lamp examination were normal, with no cells identified in the anterior chamber or vitreous. On a funduscopic examination (Figure 1A and 1B), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had temporal pallor; there was a small area of hypopigmentation close to the macula in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed increased thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer and circumferential thinning of the ganglion cell complex of the right eye; no abnormalities were noted in the left eye.\nFIGURE 1\n\nFunduscopic Images.\nThe blood creatinine level was 0.56 mg per deciliter (50 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and the blood alkaline phosphatase level 147 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). The results of other kidney-function and liver-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, the complete blood count, and the results of coagulation tests. The blood C-reactive protein level was 15 mg per liter (reference value, <8) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 34 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). A blood test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern. Tests for antibodies against aquaporin-4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) were negative. A diagnosis of atypical optic neuritis was considered. Because the patient was near delivery, further treatment was delayed until after the birth of her child, which occurred 3 days later.\nSix days after delivery of the baby, the patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional studies were obtained. Lumbar puncture was performed. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, there were no nucleated cells, and the levels of protein, glucose, albumin, and IgG were normal. There was no oligoclonal banding after concentration of the CSF. Testing of the CSF was negative for syphilis antibodies and for antibodies against aquaporin-4.\nDr. Benjamin M. Kozak: MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed prominent fusiform enlargement of a segment of the intraorbital right optic nerve with associated enhancement, as well as associated hyperintensity on the T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence. There was no evidence of associated orbital edema or other orbital abnormalities. There was a punctate hyperintense focus within the left parietal subcortical white matter on the T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, without associated enhancement or restricted diffusion.\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Chwalisz: Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone and daily plasmapheresis was administered. On the fourth hospital day, the soreness in the right eye had resolved, and there was light perception in the right eye. On the fifth hospital day, treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was changed to oral prednisone. On the ninth hospital day, rituximab was administered, and the patient was discharged home with a prescription for a 7-week tapering course of prednisone.\nDuring the next 3 weeks, treatment with rituximab was administered weekly. Two weeks after the last rituximab infusion, the patient was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at the hospital affiliated with this hospital. She reported no eye pain and only occasional headache, but she noted that the vision in the right eye had worsened. Examination revealed no light perception in the right eye, with an afferent pupillary defect. The results of a visual field test and the Ishihara color test were unchanged from the previous evaluation in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic. On a funduscopic examination (Figure 1C), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had more pronounced temporal pallor; optociliary shunt vessels were also newly present. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Kozak: Follow-up MRI of the head (Figure 2) revealed no radiologically significant change in the segmental enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve, with persistent enhancement as well as hyperintensity on the T2-weighted STIR sequence. No new orbital abnormalities were present. In addition, the punctate lesion in the left parietal subcortical white matter was unchanged.\nDr. Chwalisz: A diagnostic procedure was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Rebecca Leval (Psychiatry): A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the psychiatry clinic of this hospital 4 weeks after the birth of her first child because of anxiety and intrusive thoughts.\nThe patient (gravida 1, para 1) had had gestational hypertension, for which she had not received medication; otherwise, her pregnancy had been uncomplicated. Four weeks before the current evaluation, she went into labor at 39 weeks 1 day\u2019s gestation and gave birth to a healthy male infant by spontaneous vaginal delivery in the labor and delivery unit of this hospital. Skin-to-skin contact, in which the infant is placed on the bare chest of the mother, was started immediately after the baby was born. During the next 2 days, the patient was engaged and inquisitive during postpartum counseling and education. She was able to initiate breast-feeding and appeared to be bonding appropriately with the infant. On the fourth hospital day, she was discharged home.\nAt home, the patient breast-fed the infant but noticed that he had a poor latch. One day after discharge, the patient called the obstetrics clinic of this hospital to request lactation advice. She also described having difficulty sleeping and feeling anxious and nervous since giving birth. The patient was advised to start pumping breast milk in addition to breast-feeding. Treatment with sertraline was initiated.\nThree weeks before the current evaluation, the patient called the obstetrics clinic again for advice regarding the use of the breast pump. She was also concerned that the difficulties with breast-feeding were interfering with bonding with the infant, and she noted that her blood pressure, which she had measured with an ambulatory monitor at home, was 164/101 mm Hg. The patient was advised to seek evaluation in the labor and delivery unit of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient described insomnia, anxiety, painful nipples, decreased appetite, and mild headache. She reported no blurred vision or abdominal pain. The blood pressure was 140/84 mm Hg and the pulse 107 beats per minute. The patient appeared worried and anxious. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of kidney and liver function. The urinalysis was normal. Treatment with nifedipine was initiated for hypertension, along with lorazepam as needed for anxiety. Sertraline therapy was continued. The patient was discharged home.\nThe next day, the patient awoke and told her husband, \u201cI can\u2019t go on like this. I can\u2019t do this anymore. I can\u2019t wake up feeling like this again.\u201d He called the obstetrics clinic and was instructed to bring her to the labor and delivery unit. On evaluation, the patient stated that she had stopped breast-feeding because of bleeding of the nipples and had started feeding with formula. She felt exhausted and \u201cemotionally numb,\u201d and she sometimes could not remember whether she had fed the baby. She described feeling lonely, isolated, distressed, and unable to engage in most child care duties. The patient\u2019s mother had been visiting her and her husband to assist them with child care.\nThe patient reported that, during the pregnancy, she had been excited and had felt \u201cready and prepared,\u201d although somewhat nervous in anticipation of the delivery. She had not felt traumatized after the pregnancy or delivery, but when she had returned home, she felt \u201chit by a ton of trains.\u201d She would awaken frequently during the night when the infant made noises. When the infant was quiet, the patient was unable to sleep because of racing thoughts and feeling overwhelmed. She said, \u201cThe idea of being this baby\u2019s mother for the rest of my life is too much for me to handle. I don\u2019t want to do this now or for the rest of my life.\u201d She added, \u201cI wish I were dead sometimes\u201d but reported no active suicidal or homicidal ideation or plan.\nThe patient had a history of intermittent insomnia and migraines. She had had dysthymic symptoms as a teenager when she had moved to the United States from Central America, and she had had mild generalized anxiety and anxiety with public speaking during college, for which she had taken propranolol. She had had no previous suicidal or homicidal ideation or history of self-harm behaviors, and she had never had a psychiatric admission or intensive psychiatric treatment. The patient took prenatal vitamins, nifedipine, and sertraline. She also took lorazepam as needed for anxiety, acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for headaches, and docusate for constipation. There were no known drug allergies. She was on maternity leave from her work as an administrator, and she lived in suburban New England with her infant and husband. She felt safe and supported in the home. The patient drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Her mother had migraines, her father hypertension and anxiety, her brother anxiety, her maternal grandmother hematologic cancer, and her paternal grandmother hypertension. Her maternal grandfather had died of lung cancer and her paternal grandfather of a stroke.\nOn the day of the current evaluation, the patient presented to this hospital to establish care with a psychiatrist. On evaluation, the patient repeatedly said, \u201cThe baby is a good baby\u201d and stated that she did not want to hurt the infant or other people; however, she described intrusive thoughts of stabbing the infant and had visual hallucinations of herself holding a knife. She noted that the thoughts had started after delivery and had become increasingly vivid and frequent. They caused distress and anxiety and led to episodes of intense crying, rapid breathing, and feeling shaky. She avoided the kitchen because knives were present, and she had stopped cooking \u2014 an activity that she had previously enjoyed. The patient did not feel comfortable holding or feeding the infant because of the unwanted, intrusive thoughts and thus avoided physical contact with him. However, she checked on him every few minutes to make sure that he was alive and breathing and frequently asked her husband whether the infant was OK. The patient repeatedly searched on the internet looking for reassurance that she would not act on these thoughts. She contacted other mothers online and talked to her husband and mother to seek reassurance that she was not \u201ca bad mother.\u201d However, she had not told them or her clinicians about the intrusive thoughts because she was terrified that the infant would be taken away from her.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 138/83 mm Hg and the pulse 68 beats per minute. The patient was tearful and appeared exhausted. Her mood was anxious and dysphoric, and her affect was restricted and congruent with her mood. She did not have disorganized thinking, delusional content, or perceptual disturbances.\nA diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Patrick Malecha (Medicine): A 69-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and an implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) was evaluated because of dyspnea during an urgent visit at an outpatient primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 days before the current presentation, when he felt unwell while working. He had dyspnea on exertion (while moving and stocking boxes and when walking home from work), with baseline exertional dyspnea that occurred after ascending two to three flights of stairs. The next day, the patient had palpitations and felt lightheaded throughout the day. The palpitations continued, and he was evaluated by his primary care physician at an outpatient primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital.\nOn a review of systems, the patient reported nausea with intermittent retching, anorexia (eating only a slice of cheese for the day), and fatigue. He stated that his right eye was \u201cout of focus,\u201d but he also noted that he had had this symptom in the past. He reported no chest pain or pressure. Although he had often had angina in the past, the patient noted that he had not had any episodes in the past 2 years and that he had had only one episode of substernal discomfort, which occurred while he was walking and had lasted 45 seconds. In addition, he had had no presyncope or loss of consciousness, ICD discharge, edema, orthopnea, paroxysms of nocturnal dyspnea, fever, known sick contacts, diarrhea, weight change, abdominal pain or bloating, dysuria, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, bleeding symptoms, or focal neurologic symptoms. He had not missed any doses of medications, and his last ICD check was 3 months before the current presentation.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for premature coronary artery disease, with a first occurrence of myocardial infarction in his third decade of life. In his fifth decade of life, he had undergone coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) and subsequent stenting of the native left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary angiography, which was performed 2 years earlier for evaluation of angina, showed that the bypass graft and stent were patent but that severe native coronary disease was present (and was unchanged from an earlier study). The patient\u2019s medical history also included ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronically reduced ejection fraction and scarring of the inferior and inferoposterior left ventricle, and ventricular tachycardia that had been treated with antiarrhythmic medication and an ICD. The ICD had been placed 3 years before the current presentation during an admission at this hospital for syncope that was followed by in-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia, which required multiple external defibrillations. Thereafter, the patient received treatment with oral amiodarone; however, device interrogation revealed intermittent ventricular tachycardia at rates of 109 to 117 beats per minute that persisted over the next 8 months, and he underwent endocardial ablation of ventricular tachycardia in the scar of the mid-inferior wall. Six months after ablation, he was readmitted to this hospital because of nausea and dizziness that were due to recurrent sustained slow ventricular tachycardia (110 beats per minute), for which he was treated with intravenous lidocaine and antitachycardia pacing.\nIn addition, the patient\u2019s medical history included bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement concurrent with CABG, which had been complicated by prosthetic valve deterioration with mixed stenosis and mitral regurgitation, and culminated in transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement 2.5 years before the current presentation. He also had a history of hypertension, pulmonary embolism (4 years before the current presentation), iron-deficiency anemia, a colonic polyp, and prolonged encephalopathy after CABG. Medications included aspirin, coumadin, furosemide, metoprolol, lisinopril, dapagliflozin, ranolazine, atorvastatin, ferrous gluconate, paroxetine, and clonazepam. Treatment with amiodarone had previously been associated with elevations in liver-function test results. At the patient\u2019s last office visit with an electrophysiologist 6 months before the current presentation, device interrogation showed no ventricular tachycardia and the heart rate was 60 beats per minute; treatment with amiodarone was discontinued.\nDr. Emily K. Zern: A transthoracic echocardiogram obtained at the same office visit with the electrophysiologist showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 31% with inferior, posterior, and apical territory dysfunction; right ventricular hypokinesis; a left-to-right interatrial shunt; trace-to-mild aortic insufficiency; a well-seated mitral valve prosthesis with no regurgitation and a mean transmitral gradient of 5 mm Hg; and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 31 mm Hg.\nDr. Malecha: At a primary care visit 5 months before the current presentation, the patient reported bloating. The heart rate was 62 beats per minute and the blood pressure 104/64 mm Hg. The thyrotropin level was normal, the N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level 646 pg per milliliter (reference value, <900), the hematocrit level 40.9% (reference range, 41.0 to 53.0), and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level 74 mg per deciliter (1.92 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 129 mg per deciliter [1.29 to 3.34 mmol per liter]).\nThe patient had had a routine office visit with his cardiologist 18 days before the current presentation, during which the heart rate was 63 beats per minute and the blood pressure 111/69 mm Hg; the weight was 83 kg. No changes were made to his medications.\nDr. Conor D. Barrett: An electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained at the visit with the cardiologist showed atrial pacing, first-degree atrioventricular delay, right bundle-branch block, and evidence of old inferior, apical, and posterior myocardial infarctions (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Electrocardiogram.\nDr. Malecha: The patient was employed in multiple service jobs. He did not drink alcohol or use tobacco or other substances. He lived with several roommates on the fourth floor of an apartment building in an urban area and climbed stairs daily. His family history was notable for coronary artery disease in his father and stroke in his father, mother, and maternal grandmother.\nAt the current presentation, the temporal temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute and regular, the blood pressure 84/59 mm Hg while the patient was sitting and 99/67 mm Hg while he was in the supine position, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83 kg. The patient appeared diaphoretic and clammy, and the skin was warm to the touch. He was alert, oriented, and lucid. The previous sternotomy and ICD sites were intact. There was no heart murmur; however, a possible S3 heart sound and minimal basilar rales were observed. The jugular venous pulse was difficult to visualize. A healed appendectomy scar was present, but the abdomen was nontender, the liver was nonpulsatile, and there was no fluid wave. The legs were warm with mild, symmetric pedal edema.\nLaboratory test results were obtained 2 weeks before the current presentation. The sodium level was 139 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145), the potassium level 4.1 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.0), the creatinine level 0.91 mg per deciliter (80.44 \u03bcg per liter; reference range, 0.80 to 1.30 mg per deciliter [70.72 to 114.92 \u03bcg per liter]), the hematocrit 44.0%, the NT-proBNP 669 pg per milliliter, and the international normalized ratio (INR) 2.9 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1).\nDiagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Hayden S. Andrews (Medicine): A 73-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent fever.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 22 months before the current presentation, when 2 days of fever, cough, and fatigue developed. The patient sought evaluation at a primary care clinic affiliated with another hospital. Empirical oral antibiotic agents were administered to treat pneumonia. During the subsequent month, the cough resolved but fever recurred intermittently. The patient returned to the primary care clinic.\nDr. Rory L. Cochran: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed scattered solid pulmonary nodules, a few hepatic hemangiomas, and bilobar subcentimeter hepatic hypodensities (Figure 1A). There was borderline splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 13.0 cm in length (reference range, <13.2), and there was no lymphadenopathy.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nOne week later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen (Figure 1B) revealed that the hepatic lesions, which appeared hyperintense on T2-weighted images with enhancement, had increased in number and size, measuring up to 2.4 cm in diameter. Some lesions were only enhanced peripherally, a finding that suggested central necrosis.\nDr. Andrews: A bone marrow biopsy and a liver biopsy were performed.\nDr. Emad I. Ababneh: Pathological examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen reportedly revealed normocellular bone marrow and rare nonnecrotizing granulomas. Pathological examination of the liver-biopsy specimen showed prominent portal histiocytosis and portal and lobular nonnecrotizing granulomas (Figure 2A), with detached neutrophilic aggregates; a few of these foci were fibrin-ring granulomas (Figure 2B). Special staining for acid-fast bacilli, Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver staining, and Brown\u2013Hopps staining were negative for organisms. Immunohistochemical staining for cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and spirochetes was negative. Langerin staining for Langerhans\u2019 cells was negative.\nFIGURE 2\n\nSpecimens from Liver and Bone Marrow Biopsies.\nDr. Andrews: Twenty months before the current presentation, the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital because of 2 days of intermittent fever, which often occurred with chills, night sweats, and abdominal discomfort.\nBefore the onset of this illness, the patient had no history of recurrent fever or severe bacterial infections. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease that had led to percutaneous coronary intervention of three vessels 12 years before the current presentation. He also had a history of hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and gallstone pancreatitis that had led to a cholecystectomy 9 years earlier. Medications included rosuvastatin, aspirin, ferrous sulfate, and a multivitamin. He had no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his wife and pet cats and finches. He was a veteran who had been stationed in Guam, Thailand, and Japan, as well as in Vietnam 5 decades before the current presentation. He had traveled to the Southwest and Southeast regions of the United States 2 years before the current presentation. The patient was retired and had previously worked in the food-services industry. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, and he did not use alcohol or illicit drugs. His family history included idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, psoriasis, granuloma annulare, and chronic pancreatitis in his siblings. His son had iritis. There was no family history of frequent infections or early childhood deaths.\nThe temporal temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the pulse 79 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The lungs were clear on auscultation. He had mild tenderness in the epigastrium, as well as splenomegaly. Leukopenia and anemia were present. The levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme, 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan, and galactomannan were normal. Testing for infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B and C viruses was negative. Testing for infection with Chlamydia psittaci and Coxiella burnetii was also negative, as was testing for brucellosis, bartonellosis, listeriosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, malaria, babesiosis, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and ehrlichiosis.

There was also splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 13.5 cm in length.\nDr. Ababneh: Pathological examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen (Figure 2C) and of a specimen obtained on fine-needle aspiration of the liver showed nonnecrotizing granulomas like those seen on the previous liver biopsy. Cytologic examination of the specimens and flow cytometry of the peripheral blood were normal.\nDr. Andrews: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed no valvular vegetations. Empirical doxycycline therapy was started, and the patient was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent 19 months, the patient continued to have intermittent fever, chills, and epigastric pain, which led to additional admissions to this hospital and the other hospital. During the second admission to this hospital, 19 months before this admission, empirical doxycycline therapy was stopped, and empirical prednisone therapy was started, along with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.\nDr. Cochran: During the third admission, 18 months before this admission, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed worsening splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 14.2 cm in length, and hepatic lesions that had increased in size and number. A percutaneous drain was placed in the largest hepatic lesion (Figure 1D), which measured 4.0 cm in diameter.\nDr. Andrews: Bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures of the drained fluid did not grow organisms; however, culture of the blood showed growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy, which revealed gastritis, esophagitis, and diverticulosis. Treatment with prednisone and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was stopped, intravenous ceftriaxone was started, and he was discharged home.\nThe patient\u2019s fourth and fifth admissions occurred at the other hospital 17 months and 16 months before this admission, respectively. During the fourth admission, another percutaneous drain was placed in a dominant hepatic lesion, and cultures reportedly resulted in no growth. The patient received a course of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. During the fifth admission, cultures again reportedly showed no growth. The patient received another course of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and was discharged home with instructions to restart empirical doxycycline therapy.\nDr. Cochran: The sixth admission also occurred at the other hospital, 1 month before this admission. CT of the abdomen revealed numerous new and enlarged hypodense hepatic lesions with new scattered subcentimeter splenic hypodensities (Figure 1E).\nDr. Abahneh: Another liver biopsy was performed, which revealed liver parenchyma with abscess, acute inflammation and debris, and histiocytic and stromal reaction with histiocytic aggregates. Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver staining showed few bacteria, and a culture grew Escherichia coli; no acid-fast bacilli or fungal forms were detected.\nDr. Andrews: Treatment with doxycycline was stopped, intravenous ceftriaxone was started, and the patient was discharged home with instructions to start taking ciprofloxacin. During the subsequent month, fever did not abate. The patient returned to this hospital for a seventh admission.\nDr. Cochran: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed stable scattered solid pulmonary nodules, new interstitial pulmonary edema, and increased splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 15.0 cm in length. There was also an increase in the size and number of the hepatic and splenic hypodensities (Figure 1F).\nDr. Andrews: The patient underwent EGD, which showed portal hypertensive gastropathy. TTE showed no vegetations. Aspiration of a hepatic lesion was performed, and a culture grew Enterococcus faecalis. Treatment with amoxicillin was started.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Christine M. Parsons (Medicine): A 75-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of arthritis, abdominal pain, edema, malaise, and fever.\nThree weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed waxing and waning \u201cthrobbing\u201d pain in the right upper abdomen, which she rated at 9 (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain) at its maximal intensity. The pain was associated with nausea and fever with a temperature of up to 39.0\u00b0C. Pain worsened after food consumption and was relieved with acetaminophen. During the 3 weeks before the current admission, edema developed in both legs; it had started at the ankles and gradually progressed upward to the hips. When the edema began to affect her ambulation, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems that was obtained from the patient and her family was notable for intermittent fever, abdominal bloating, anorexia, and fatigue that had progressed during the previous 3 weeks. The patient reported new orthopnea and nonproductive cough. Approximately 4 weeks earlier, she had had diarrhea for several days. During the 6 weeks before the current admission, the patient had lost 9 kg unintentionally; she also had had pain in the wrists and hands, 3 days of burning and dryness of the eyes, and diffuse myalgias. She had not had night sweats, dry mouth, jaw claudication, vision changes, urinary symptoms, or oral, nasal, or genital ulcers.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for multiple myeloma (for which treatment with thalidomide and melphalan had been initiated 2 years earlier and was stopped approximately 1 year before the current admission); hypothyroidism; chikungunya virus infection (diagnosed 7 years earlier); seropositive erosive rheumatoid arthritis affecting the hands, wrists, elbows, and shoulders (diagnosed 3 years earlier); vitiligo; and osteoarthritis of the right hip, for which she had undergone arthroplasty. Evidence of gastritis was reportedly seen on endoscopy that had been performed 6 months earlier. Medications included daily treatment with levothyroxine and acetaminophen and pipazethate hydrochloride as needed for cough. The patient consumed chamomile and horsetail herbal teas. She had no known allergies to medications, but she had been advised not to take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs after her diagnosis of multiple myeloma.\nApproximately 5 months before the current admission, the patient had emigrated from Central America. She lived with her daughter and grandchildren in an urban area of New England. She had previously worked in health care. She had no history of alcohol, tobacco, or other substance use. There was no family history of cancer or autoimmune, renal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, or cardiac disease.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 152/67 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She had a frail appearance and bitemporal cachexia. The weight was 41 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 15.2. Her dentition was poor; most of the teeth were missing, caries were present in the remaining teeth, and the mucous membranes were dry. She had abdominal tenderness on the right side and mild abdominal distention, without organomegaly or guarding. Bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy was palpable. Infrequent inspiratory wheezing was noted.\nThe patient had swan-neck deformity, boutonni\u00e8re deformity, ulnar deviation, and distal hyperextensibility of the thumbs (Fig. 1). Subcutaneous nodules were observed on the proximal interphalangeal joints of the second and third fingers of the right hand and on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger of the left hand. Synovial thickening of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the second fingers was noted. There was mild swelling and tenderness of the wrists. She had pain with flexion of the shoulders and right hip, and there was subtle swelling of the shoulders and right knee. Pitting edema (3+) and vitiligo were noted on the legs. No sclerodactyly, digital pitting, telangiectasias, appreciable calcinosis, nodules, nail changes (including pitting), or tophi were present. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nFIGURE 1\n\nPhotograph of the Hands.\nThe blood levels of glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, globulin, lactate, lipase, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal, as were the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 3+ protein and 3+ blood, and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field and granular casts. Urine and blood were obtained for culture.

    "user_input": "Dr. Mallory C. Mandel (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 weeks before the current presentation, when intermittent abdominal pain developed. During the next 2 weeks, the episodes of pain became more frequent, increasing from every few days to two times daily and lasting approximately 2 minutes. Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient had new nausea, and she vomited three times. She was not able to go to school, and her parents took her to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient described the pain as sharp and rated it at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain was worst in the epigastrium and in the upper quadrants of the abdomen. The temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 105 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry. She had diffuse abdominal tenderness with guarding on palpation of the epigastrium, left upper quadrant, and right upper quadrant. The white-cell count was 14,900 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000) and the hemoglobin level 11.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Qualitative urine testing for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative, and urinalysis was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis showed no abnormalities, although the appendix was not visualized. Oral acetaminophen was administered, as were intravenous ketorolac, famotidine, and ondansetron. The patient was discharged home with instructions to start treatment with oral famotidine, ondansetron, and ibuprofen.\nTable 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range, Other Hospital, 13 Days before Current Admission, Other Hospital, Reference Range, This Hospital, On Current Admission, This Hospital\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 3900-11,000, 8390, 4500-11,000, 5460\nHematocrit (%), 34.0-46.0, 26.4, 36.0-46.0, 26.7\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 11.0-15.0, 8.0, 12.0-16.0, 8.3\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 130,000-400,000, 220,000, 150,000-400,000, 108,000\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5-14.2, 19.5, 11.5-14.5, 17.4\nInternational normalized ratio for prothrombin time, 0.9-1.1, 1.8, 0.9-1.1, 1.5\nSodium (mmol/liter), 136-145, 132, 135-145, 132\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4-5.1, 4.9, 3.4-5.0, 5.1\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98-107, 97, 98-108, 100\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 20-31, 21, 23-32, 21\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 6-20, 43, 8-25, 73\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.50-1.00, 1.99, 0.60-1.50, 2.45\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70-100, 140, 70-110, 146\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5-10.5, 8.4, 8.5-10.5, 8.6\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 0-33, 42, 9-32, 55\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 0-34, 16, 7-33, 19\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 40-130, 296, 30-100, 279\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0-1.2, 3.7, 0.0-1.0, 3.1\nDirect bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0-0.3, 1.8, 0.0-0.4, 0.9\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.5-5.0, 2.7, 3.3-5.0, 3.9\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.4-8.3, 6.2, 6.0-8.3, 6.0\nLipase (U/liter), 13-60, 34, \u2014, \u2014\nLactic acid (mmol/liter), 0.5-2.2, 2.0, \u2014, \u2014\nEthanol (mg/dl), 0-10, <10, \u2014, \u2014\n\nDuring the next week, the patient continued to have intermittent episodes of abdominal pain and nausea, and she left early from school on two days because of pain. She took ibuprofen on one occasion, but the pain subsequently worsened; she decided not to take any additional doses. She did not take any doses of famotidine or ondansetron.\nOne week before the current presentation, abdominal pain woke the patient from sleep, and her parents took her to the emergency department at the other hospital. The mucous membranes were dry, and no abdominal distention or tenderness was noted. The white-cell count was 13,000 per microliter and the hemoglobin level 11.4 g per deciliter. Repeat ultrasonography of the abdomen and repeat transabdominal ultrasonography of the pelvis again showed no abnormalities. Screening tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia were negative. The patient was discharged home with instructions to start treatment with famotidine, ondansetron, and acetaminophen.\nDuring the subsequent week, episodes of abdominal pain and nausea continued to occur. On the day of the current presentation, the episodes of pain lasted 15 minutes, and the patient vomited five times. Her parents brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nThe patient described the episodes of abdominal pain as severe, occurring abruptly, and followed by nausea; when vomiting occurred, the severity of pain decreased. The pain was not related to menstruation, body position, time of day, or eating or drinking, although she noted that she had had decreased appetite. She had had fatigue, dizziness, and generalized weakness, as well as constipation that had worsened during the previous 2 weeks; the last bowel movement had occurred 3 days before the current presentation. There was no fever, diarrhea, or rash.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history included iron-deficiency anemia and anxiety disorder; she had had pica as a toddler. She had normal growth and development and had received all childhood vaccinations. Medications included iron supplementation, oral contraception, and famotidine, as well as acetaminophen as needed for abdominal pain; she had not started taking ondansetron. She had no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her mother, father, sister, and dog in an urban area of New England. She attended high school. She was sexually active and had had two male partners; she used condoms consistently. She did not drink alcohol, use illicit drugs, or smoke tobacco; she had last smoked marijuana 4 weeks before the current presentation. Her maternal grandmother had peptic ulcer disease, her maternal grandfather had heart disease, and her father had depression and anxiety.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 84 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 113/78 mm Hg. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The patient was actively retching during the examination. The mucous membranes were moist, and bowel sounds were present. The abdomen was nondistended, soft, and diffusely tender (predominantly in the epigastrium), and there was guarding without rebound. The rectal examination was normal, with no palpable stool in the rectal vault. The white-cell count was 15,720 per microliter and the hemoglobin level 10.8 g per deciliter. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The urine level of human chorionic gonadotropin was less than 6 IU per milliliter (reference range in nonpregnant adults, 0 to 6), and urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Ali Pourvaziri: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material and without the administration of oral contrast material, showed the gastric contents, a normal appendix, and no evidence of bowel obstruction. There was a small amount of solid stool in the ascending colon and sigmoid colon.\nA mixture of aluminum hydroxide, diphenhydramine, lidocaine, magnesium hydroxide, and magnesium citrate was administered, but the patient vomited after taking these medications.",

Andrews (Medicine): A 39-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital during the summer because of fever with shaking chills, diffuse headache, and fatigue, which had lasted for the 4 days since he had returned from a trip to East Africa.\nDuring the patient\u2019s 2-week trip, he had been on a safari in Tanzania but had not had any contact with animals. He reported that he had received mosquito bites, especially during the first days of the trip. He had eaten cooked shrimp and lobster and a small amount of raw tuna. On the second-to-last day of the trip, nausea, vomiting, and nonbloody diarrhea developed. On the last day of the trip, the patient had fatigue and slept for much of the day; however, he felt well enough to travel home the next day.\nOn the night the patient returned home to Massachusetts, he began to have fever with a temperature of 38.3\u00b0C, along with shaking chills, diffuse headache, and lower back pain. The following day, he presented to an urgent care facility because of fever, malaise, and headache. The oral temperature was 38.5\u00b0C; the remainder of the examination was normal. Nucleic acid testing was negative for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Oral prednisone was prescribed for the treatment of headache. On the third day home, in the evening, the patient had fever with a temperature of 39.5\u00b0C and lower back pain. The next morning, 4 days after returning from the trip, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported recurrent fevers accompanied by blurry vision, which had occurred despite the use of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and prednisone. He reported ongoing weakness and anorexia, noting that he was consuming mostly fruits and electrolyte-replacement solutions. He had had nausea with diarrhea but without vomiting. The patient noted that his urine output had decreased and that the urine appeared darker than usual. Review of systems was negative for myalgias, rash, neck stiffness, photophobia, respiratory symptoms, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, and joint pain. His travel companion reported no symptoms. The patient reported no known tick exposures before or during travel in Tanzania.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for degenerative knee disease with a meniscus tear, for which he had received glucocorticoid injections. There were no known adverse drug reactions. He had received a series of three vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2. He lived with his partner in a suburb of Boston. He had been a competitive athlete and was employed in the energy industry. He drank beer occasionally and did not use tobacco or other substances.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113/62 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 104.3 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 30.3. Facial flushing and mild scleral icterus were present. The urine was dark brown. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of calcium, creatine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An extended respiratory viral panel and a screening test for Lyme disease IgM and IgG antibodies were negative. Urinalysis showed 3+ blood, and microscopic examination of the urinary sediment showed 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2).

    "user_input": "Dr. James W. Luccarelli (Psychiatry): A 70-year-old man with bipolar disorder was evaluated at this hospital because of depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and gait disturbance.\nThe patient had a long history of depressive episodes, with two previous hospitalizations for suicide attempts. Approximately two decades before the current admission, he was struck on the head with a beam while working at a construction site and had a 4-cm laceration. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital, where the wound was sutured but no further evaluation was conducted.\nApproximately 10 years before the current admission, around the time of his mother\u2019s death, the patient was evaluated at this hospital because of an episode of irritability, a reduced need for sleep, and grandiosity; he reported feelings of \u201ctranscendence\u201d and being \u201cat one with God.\u201d He was admitted for 1 month to the psychiatry unit of a second hospital, where he was treated with lithium and electroconvulsive therapy. Thereafter, he received outpatient psychiatric treatment on a monthly basis, as well as therapy with valproic acid and fluoxetine.\nApproximately 9 years before the current admission, the patient fell on concrete stairs and had back pain with subsequent lower-leg weakness and urinary incontinence. He was evaluated at a third hospital, where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes, including L4\u2013L5 spinal stenosis and central disk protrusion. Acetaminophen and physical therapy were prescribed.\nFive years later (4 years before the current admission), the patient fell because of an unsteady gait and was evaluated at a fourth hospital. Neurologic examination revealed a memory deficit (with an inability to recall any objects after 5 minutes on the three-item object-recall test) and poor attention (with an inability to perform serial sevens calculations), as well as action tremor in the arms and \u201cmildly unsteady\u201d gait, even with the use of a cane. The remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, results of renal function tests, and levels of electrolytes, valproic acid, folate, vitamin B12, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin were normal; serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. MRI of the head reportedly revealed no evidence of an infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or a mass but showed mild prominence of ventricles, sulci, and cisterns. The dose of fluoxetine was decreased, and the patient was discharged 3 days later.\nAdditional falls occurred 2 months and 4 months later, and both times, the patient was evaluated at the fourth hospital. Two months after the most recent fall, he hit the car in front of him while driving. His psychiatrist noted that he had bilateral tremor at rest; the dose of valproic acid was reduced, and he was referred to a neurologist. Two months after the car crash, he fell while walking and was evaluated at the fourth hospital. The evaluation was notable for nystagmus and a normal valproic acid level (89 \u03bcg per milliliter; reference range, 50 to 100) despite the dose reduction; the doses of valproic acid and trazodone were reduced, and physical therapy was provided. During the next 5 months, gait instability was reduced but persisted. The patient was evaluated by two other neurologists after reporting a feeling of \u201cimbalance.\u201d Audiometry revealed mild-to-moderate high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Medications were considered to be a contributor to his balance dysfunction.\nDuring the next 12 months, the dose of valproic acid was tapered and fluoxetine was stopped; the patient underwent trials of escitalopram and then sertraline for the treatment of depressive symptoms. He reported to his psychiatrist symptoms of confusion, some difficulty with memory, and decreased leg coordination. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 23 (scores range from 0 to 30, with a score of 18 to 25 suggesting mild cognitive impairment).\nDr. McKinley Glover: Fifteen months before the current admission, the patient began to have dizziness. MRI of the head (Figure 1), performed at this hospital, revealed an old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss, and mild ventricular prominence.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial MRI of the Head.\nDr. Luccarelli: Neuropsychiatric testing was performed, and the results did not suggest a neurodegenerative process. Given the patient\u2019s progressively depressed mood, treatment with aripiprazole was started, with the dose adjusted over the following 12 months.\nThree months before the current admission, the patient reported worsening depression, with hopelessness, guilt, and increased sleep. That month, his son found him unable to walk and requiring assistance to move. On examination, he had tremor and muscle rigidity; on ambulation, he had a shuffling gait and required a cane. Treatment with aripiprazole was stopped, benztropine was started, and sertraline was replaced by fluoxetine.\nOne month before the current admission, the patient was voluntarily hospitalized in the psychiatry unit of this hospital because of worsening depression, which he attributed to the progressive reduction in mobility and strength. He reported 3 weeks of frequent early morning awakenings, anhedonia, low energy, anorexia, difficulty concentrating, and low motivation, such that he had not paid bills or bathed. Examination was notable for tremor, muscle rigidity, and a shuffling gait. Blood levels of folate, vitamin B12, and glycated hemoglobin were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 antibodies and type 1 antigen and for antitreponemal antibodies were negative. Over the 5-day hospitalization, the dose of fluoxetine was increased and treatment with lurasidone was started.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), 1 Mo before Admission (This Hospital), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 130, 136  \nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 4.6, 4.4  \nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 92, 99  \nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 25, 24  \nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 21, 18  \nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.99, 1.02  \nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 77, 74  \nValproic acid (\u03bcg/ml), 50\u2013100, 66.8, 50.8  \n25-Hydroxyvitamin D (ng/ml), 20\u201380, 27, 29  \nThyrotropin (\u03bcIU/ml), 0.40\u20135.00, 6.66, 3.21  \nFree thyroxine (ng/dl), 0.9\u20131.8, 1.2, \u2014\n\nDuring the following 4 weeks, the patient\u2019s ability to walk continued to deteriorate, and he required intermittent use of a walker and a wheelchair. His depressive symptoms persisted, and after he reported thoughts of suicide and feeling unsafe to his psychiatrist, he was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for malaise, anorexia, poor sleep, anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt, low energy, worsening gait, and chronic joint pain; he reported no recent falls or manic symptoms.\nThe patient\u2019s psychiatric history included bipolar depression with suicide attempts and multiple psychiatric admissions, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, and skin picking. His medical history was notable for long-standing urinary incontinence, hypertension, and sleep apnea; he had undergone laser ablation of the prostate 4 years earlier, as well as bilateral inguinal hernia repair and rotator cuff repair. Medications at the time of admission included fluoxetine, lurasidone, valproic acid, aspirin, and lisinopril, as well as lorazepam and trazodone as needed. Lithium had caused tremor, aripiprazole had caused muscle rigidity and tremor, and gabapentin had caused grogginess. The patient did not smoke tobacco, and he drank alcohol less than once monthly; he had previously smoked marijuana several times daily but had been abstinent for 2 years. He was retired from employment as a laborer. He was divorced and resided in an assisted-living facility. His family history was notable for major depression in his mother and bipolar disorder in one of his children.\nThe temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/61 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.5. The patient was wheelchair-bound. He was described as well-groomed and cooperative, with appropriate eye contact. He was oriented to time, place, and person. His speech was fluent and indicated a logical thought process but was considered to be \u201cslow.\u201d Some of his responses seemed slow, but naming, repetition, attention, concentration, and memory were intact. His mood and affect were described as depressed, and he had suicidal ideation. Results of cranial nerve examination were normal, except for reduced facial expression. Motor examination showed mildly increased tone in the lower legs and left arm, with bradykinesia, and was otherwise normal. The gait was described as being \u201cslow to start\u201d with a \u201cmagnetic quality\u201d and then as \u201cshuffling\u201d for a few steps. The remainder of the neurologic and general physical examinations was normal.\nThe white-cell count, platelet count, and levels of hemoglobin, calcium, and albumin were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Glover: MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed the old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, and mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss with prominence of the ventricles and sylvian fissures. There was no abnormal enhancement. Coronal reformatted images showed a callosal angle (the angle at which the two lateral ventricles meet at the level of the posterior commissure) of 66 degrees.\nFIGURE 2\n\nAdditional MRI of the Head.\nDr. Luccarelli: Diagnostic tests were performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Theodore R. Pak (Medicine): A 34-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital with hypercortisolism in the context of a metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.\nThe patient had been well until 4 years before this presentation, when abdominal pain, diarrhea, and ascites developed. A pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with metastases to the liver and spleen was ultimately diagnosed, and treatment with octreotide and everolimus was initiated.\nThree years before this presentation, treatment with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy was initiated; four cycles were completed over the course of the next 2 years. Eight months before this presentation, the patient decided to stop taking everolimus because of fatigue.\nSeven months before this presentation, the patient was evaluated at another hospital because of weight gain, hyperglycemia, and changes in mood. She was found to have elevated blood levels of corticotropin and elevated salivary and urinary levels of cortisol.\nDr. Adina Haramati: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a pituitary lesion measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. A specimen of blood obtained from the inferior petrosal sinus identified a pituitary source of corticotropin secretion.\nDr. Pak: Treatment with octreotide was discontinued, and 3 months before this presentation, transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary lesion was performed. After the surgery, the cortisol and corticotropin levels remained elevated. Repeat MRI of the head revealed a residual pituitary lesion. Transsphenoidal resection of the residual lesion was performed 2 months before this presentation.\nAfter the second surgery, the cortisol and corticotropin levels decreased but did not normalize. Pathological evaluation of a resected pituitary specimen revealed normal anterior pituitary architecture that was not consistent with a corticotroph adenoma. At a follow-up appointment in the endocrinology clinic after the patient was discharged, the 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was again elevated, and treatment with pasireotide was initiated.\nTen days before this presentation, the patient began to have confusion, urinary incontinence, and recurrent falls. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. Her husband noted atypical impulsive behaviors, such as online shopping and excessive eating.\nDr. Haramati: MRI of the head revealed a small focus of decreased enhancement within the left inferior aspect of the sella turcica, a finding that was consistent with postsurgical changes or residual adenoma.\nDr. Pak: A morning blood level of cortisol was 80 \u03bcg per deciliter (2207 nmol per liter; reference range, 4 to 23 \u03bcg per deciliter [110 to 635 nmol per liter]), and the blood level of corticotropin was 519 pg per milliliter (114 pmol per liter; reference range, 7.2 to 63 pg per milliliter [1.6 to 14 pmol per liter]). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 9450 \u03bcg (26,069 nmol per liter; reference range, 3.5 to 45 \u03bcg [10 to 124 nmol per liter]).\nDr. Haramati: MRI of the abdomen revealed an exophytic mass on the pancreatic tail that broadly abutted the left adrenal gland, thickening of both adrenal glands, retroperitoneal metastases on the left side, and extensive hepatic metastases with chronic cavernous transformation of the portal vein.\nDr. Pak: Treatment with pasireotide was discontinued, and treatment with ketoconazole was initiated, in addition to potassium supplementation and spironolactone for hypokalemia. On the tenth day at the other hospital, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment.\nOn evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported fatigue but no fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. She had no cough, hemoptysis, or chest pain; no rheumatologic symptoms; and no history of dysphagia or gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her medical history included asthma and portal-vein thrombosis complicated by ascites, as well as hypothyroidism and central diabetes insipidus after she had undergone transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary lesions. Medications included atovaquone, cholecalciferol, desmopressin, ketoconazole, levothyroxine, metformin, pantoprazole, spironolactone, and potassium chloride. She had no known drug allergies. She did not drink alcohol or use tobacco or vaping products; she smoked marijuana occasionally. She lived with her husband in Vermont and had previously worked in a health care facility. The patient reported that she had had several skin tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis owing to her work in the health care setting, and none had been positive. Before her illness, she had frequently gardened and hiked locally. She had traveled to Canada but otherwise had not traveled outside New England. A paternal aunt had had ovarian cancer.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 152/87 mm Hg, the pulse 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.0. The patient was alert and oriented and answered questions appropriately. Her face was rounded, and acne and hair thinning were present. The abdomen had increased adiposity and palpable striae. There were several bruises on her arms and legs. A chest radiograph obtained on admission to this hospital showed an implanted venous access device and a patchy opacity in the right upper lung zone.\nTreatment with octreotide was reinitiated, and treatment with the other medications that the patient had been receiving was continued. The hypercortisolism was thought to be due to secretion of corticotropin from the metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Bilateral adrenalectomy was planned, but on the second hospital day, the patient became withdrawn and would not speak, take any oral medications, or consume any food. She was transferred to the intensive care unit, and an etomidate infusion was initiated; the dose was adjusted to attain a blood level of cortisol between 10 and 20 \u03bcg per deciliter. Subsequent treatment with intravenous lorazepam resulted in marked improvement in the patient\u2019s mental status such that she was following commands and responding appropriately to questions. On the sixth hospital day, bilateral adrenalectomy was performed. Treatment with intravenous hydrocortisone was initiated postoperatively, and on the seventh hospital day, the patient was transferred to the medicine unit of this hospital for further care.\nDr. Haramati: On the eighth hospital day, sinus tachycardia developed. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material according to a pulmonary embolism protocol (Figure 1), revealed a patchy consolidation in the right upper lobe with areas of cavitation and adjacent tree-in-bud opacities, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Although previous imaging was not available for review, clinical notes indicated that positron-emission tomography\u2013CT performed at another hospital 8 months before this presentation had revealed a new cavitary nodule in the right upper lobe that measured 7 mm in diameter.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Chest.\nDr. Pak: A sputum culture showed few squamous epithelial cells, rare polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with no specific type predominating; no acid-fast bacilli were observed on a mycobacterial smear of an induced sputum sample. Urine tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens were negative, as was a blood test for cryptococcal antigen. The blood level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60), and the blood galactomannan index was 0.05 (reference range, 0 to 0.49).

He was taken to the primary care clinic at another hospital and was told that he had a viral infection.\nNine days before this admission, new mild sore throat developed, and the patient returned to the primary care clinic. A throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was reportedly negative. The patient was told that he had possible sinusitis, and treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was started. During the next 3 days, the sore throat abated, but fatigue and fever persisted.\nSix days before this admission, new pain in the right shoulder and left knee developed, and the patient again returned to the primary care clinic. The white-cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reportedly elevated; a blood test for Lyme disease was performed.\nOn the day of admission, the joint pain progressed to involve the shoulders and knees on both sides, and the temperature increased to 39.4\u00b0C. The patient was given ibuprofen and brought to the emergency department at this hospital. On evaluation, the patient described aching pain in the shoulders and knees, which was worst in his right shoulder and left knee. He rated the pain at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had not noticed redness, swelling, or stiffness of the joints. A review of systems was notable for chills, intermittent night sweats, headache, myalgias, and lightheadedness when he stood up from a sitting position. He had no weight loss, rash, vision changes, or respiratory symptoms. He had mild abdominal cramping, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea. During the past week, there had been a few episodes of nonbloody emesis and watery diarrhea. There had been no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.\nThe patient had autism spectrum disorder, with an early delay in speech development that had resolved after speech therapy. He had met milestones for gross and fine motor skills and growth. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. Other history included asthma, seasonal rhinosinusitis, and allergies to peanuts and tree nuts; there were no known drug allergies. He had undergone a tonsillectomy in early childhood. Medications included amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, inhaled fluticasone, and ibuprofen and inhaled albuterol as needed.\nAt the time of admission, the patient was on his summer break before entering high school. Earlier in the summer, he had gone on vacation to a coastal area of New England. He had also attended camp in a rural area of New England, where he camped and hiked in wooded areas and swam in fresh water. He had seen a tick on his clothing but did not recall any bites. Two weeks before this admission, the patient had returned to his home in a suburban area of New England, where he lived with his mother (who was a veterinarian), father, sister, and pet dog. His sister had recently had an acute gastrointestinal illness that resolved after several days. The patient was not sexually active and did not use alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. His mother had hypothyroidism, and his maternal uncle had rheumatoid arthritis; there was no other known family history of autoimmune diseases.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.2. The patient appeared to be well developed and well nourished, but he looked tired. The conjunctivae were normal. The mucous membranes were dry, and there was an aphthous ulcer on the right buccal mucosa. The lungs were clear on auscultation. There was tenderness on palpation of the epigastric and periumbilical abdomen. There was no erythema, warmth, swelling, or crepitus of the large and small joints. There was tenderness on palpation, as well as pain with movement, of the right shoulder and knees; range of motion in these joints was not decreased.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple fluid-filled small-bowel loops with associated mild mesenteric edema and trace ascites. There was no biliary dilatation. In addition, there were numerous hypoattenuating hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement.\nDr. Gumuser: The patient was admitted to the other hospital with a diagnosis of possible small-bowel obstruction and pneumonia. Treatment with intravenous fluids and ceftriaxone, oral doxycycline, and bowel rest was initiated. On the second hospital day, additional imaging studies of the liver were obtained.\nDr. Price: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen (Figure 1), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilobar hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement, high T2 signal, and diffusion restriction.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Gumuser: Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture, and treatment with intravenous metronidazole was initiated. On the third hospital day, the abdominal pain had resolved, and the patient began drinking clear fluids. On the fourth hospital day, ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was performed. While the results of the liver biopsy were pending, the patient resumed a normal diet, with no recurrence of abdominal pain. Treatment with oral doxycycline and intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole was continued.\nDr. Price: On the sixth hospital day, CT of the chest (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed numerous irregular cysts and cavitary nodules in the lungs, which were most pronounced in the upper lobes, as well as solid and subsolid parenchymal nodules that measured less than 1.0 cm in diameter. There were multiple nodules in the thyroid gland, measuring up to 2.8 cm in diameter in the inferior left thyroid lobe. There was a 1.7-cm nodule with soft-tissue attenuation in the right breast.\nDr. Gumuser: On the eighth hospital day, bronchoscopy was performed. The airways were inspected to the segmental level, and no abnormalities were visualized. Transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in the right upper lobe. Examination of the BAL fluid revealed 321 white cells per microliter (reference range, 94 to 175). Gram\u2019s staining and examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear of the BAL fluid were negative.\nOn the ninth hospital day, results of the liver biopsy became available, showing extensive eosinophilic infiltration of the liver parenchyma with associated moderate steatosis. Staining of the biopsy specimen for microorganisms, including mycobacteria, was negative. Cultures of blood obtained on the second hospital day showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further care.\nOn arrival, the patient reported a mild sore throat that had developed after bronchoscopy, but there was no abdominal pain. She had lost 2 kg of weight before the hospitalization, in the context of dietary changes. She had no history of fever but reported a several-year history of mild shortness of breath with walking that she attributed to smoking. Her surgical history included cholecystectomy and cesarean section. Results of a Papanicolaou test performed 3 months before this presentation had been normal; the patient had not undergone mammography or colonoscopy. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived in an urban area of New England. She was born in Portugal and had immigrated to the United States 40 years earlier. She had not traveled recently; her last trip had been to Portugal 25 years before this admission. The patient was divorced, lived alone, and worked in a medical laboratory. She had no known exposure to chemicals or dust; a coworker at a previous office job had had an atypical infection attributed to mold in the workplace. She had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. She drank alcohol three times a week and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from colon cancer at 43 years of age.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 130/64 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

    "user_input": "Dr. Alba Coraini (Neurology): A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of back pain and leg stiffness.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 years before the current presentation, when stiffness in the back and upper legs developed abruptly while she attempted to rise from a seated position. She also began to have associated low back pain that worsened with bending the knees or climbing stairs. During the next several months, back and leg stiffness waxed and waned; at times, the patient could walk normally and engage in running for exercise, and at other times, she was unable to walk because her knees felt as though they had \u201clocked up.\u201d Two months after the onset of symptoms, the patient fell and broke her right arm. She perceived the fall as being unusual in that after she tripped, she was unable to prevent herself from falling because of tension in her legs. After the fall, the patient underwent physical therapy for several months, but she did not resume running for exercise because of a fear of falling.\nTwo and a half years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in a rheumatology clinic of another hospital. Passive flexion of the left knee was guarded, but the knee bent when a distraction technique was used; the remainder of the examination was normal. Hip and knee radiographs were reportedly unremarkable. The knee stiffness was not thought to be due to an underlying rheumatologic disorder.\nOne and a half years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated for knee pain in the sports medicine clinic affiliated with this hospital. The pain was localized to the anterior portions of the knees at the level of the patellae; it worsened with climbing stairs and resolved with rest. Examination and radiographs of the knees showed no abnormalities. Patellofemoral pain syndrome was diagnosed, and physical therapy was recommended. The knee pain resolved after physical therapy, but the patient continued to have leg stiffness and did not return to running owing to a fear of falling.\nThree months before the current presentation, the patient noticed ongoing lower back pain and increased stiffness in the legs that was worse in the right leg. She felt unsteady on her feet and worried about tripping while walking or falling while climbing stairs. While walking in her house, she hit her leg on a coffee table; both legs stiffened, and she fell, striking her face on the floor. There was no loss of consciousness. She was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, she had mild tenderness on palpation of the lumbar spine. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed normal paraspinal soft tissues and exaggeration of the normal lumbar lordosis, with preserved vertebral height. A loss of normal signal intensity was noted in the L4\u2013L5 intervertebral disk space on T2-weighted images, a finding that was consistent with mild degeneration. Evaluation for signal abnormality in the visible portion of the spinal cord and in the cauda equina nerve roots could not be assessed owing to severe motion artifact. There was no evidence of high-grade spinal canal or foraminal stenosis.\nDr. Coraini: Treatment with cyclobenzaprine, which was to be taken as needed at night for back pain, was initiated, and physical therapy was recommended. However, after 3 months of physical therapy, the back pain had not abated, and the leg stiffness had worsened. The patient sought evaluation in the neurology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the neurology clinic, the patient reported ongoing leg stiffness and rigidity that caused gait abnormalities. She noticed jerking movements at night as she was falling asleep. Three months before the current evaluation, she had taken lorazepam for claustrophobia before entering the MRI machine for spinal imaging, and her gait was reportedly normal for several hours after imaging.\nThe patient had a history of vitiligo, eczema, and alopecia areata. Graves\u2019 disease, for which she had been treated with methimazole, was in remission. Immune thrombocytopenia, which had been diagnosed 7 years before the current presentation, had been treated with a course of intravenous immune globulin. In addition to cyclobenzaprine, medications included cetirizine, desogestrel\u2013ethinyl estradiol, and a multivitamin. She had no known allergies. She lived in New England with her husband and had recently started a new job as an office manager. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. One sister had autoimmune thyroiditis, and another had alopecia areata.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/91 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.7. The patient appeared anxious but was in no acute distress. Strength was assessed as normal in the arms and legs. She had mildly increased tone in the legs; no fasciculations were present. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ in the arms and 3+ in the legs, with nonsustained clonus in the ankles. An exaggerated startle response was present. Sensation was normal. On ambulation, there was reduced flexion of the knees and a wide-based gait.\nBlood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of creatine kinase was 33 U per liter (reference range, 26 to 192), the C-reactive protein level 1 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 10), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 2 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Schaefer: MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1), was limited by motion artifact. No specific cord abnormality was identified. Mild degenerative changes were noted in the thoracolumbar spine, without moderate or severe narrowing of the spinal canal or neural foramina. No abnormal enhancement was seen. Possible atrophy of the posterior paraspinal musculature was detected in the lower lumbar spine. Exaggeration of the normal lumbar lordosis was noted.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Spine.\nDr. Coraini: A diagnostic test was performed.",

He had occasional bleeding from the mouth that resolved spontaneously. He consulted with his dentist, who was concerned about the possibility of impacted wisdom teeth. Two days before the current presentation, a sore throat developed. There was no difficulty with swallowing. On the day of the current presentation, epistaxis developed and did not resolve over a period of 2 hours.\nThe patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 142/76 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. He had blood in the nares and petechiae on the soft palate. There was a large ecchymosis on the left forearm that the patient attributed to carrying heavy boxes several days earlier. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), a platelet count of 1000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000), and a white-cell count of 670 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). The absolute neutrophil count was 50 per microliter (reference range, 1800 to 7000).

There was no fever, weight loss, rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The patient had a history of sickle cell trait. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He had been living with his parents and younger brother since he had left his college campus at the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. He worked in a grocery store, and his only known sick contact was his mother, who had been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2 months earlier. She had been isolated in a room in their home during her illness. The patient did not have any symptoms associated with Covid-19 and had never been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. His father and brother had been well. The family lived adjacent to a wooded region, and the patient had been hiking in northern New England 2 months before the current presentation. He had not noticed any tick bites. He had no animal contacts. The patient was born in Central America and had moved to a suburban region of New England at 3 years of age. He had previously traveled to Mexico and Canada. He was sexually active with female partners only. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and paternal family members had sickle cell disease.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well. There were petechiae on the soft palate (Figure 1). There was no scleral icterus, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly. A large ecchymosis was present on the left forearm. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of folate and cobalamin were normal, as were results of serum protein electrophoresis and the ratio of free kappa to lambda light chains. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A radiograph of the chest and an ultrasound image of the upper abdomen were normal, without splenomegaly. Testing of a specimen obtained from the nasopharynx was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA; the patient was admitted to the hospital and placed in enhanced isolation. Examination of thick and thin peripheral-blood smears for babesia was negative.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photograph.\nA second unit of platelets was transfused, and a diagnostic test was performed.",

The nausea and vomiting resolved after 1 day, but fatigue developed. Two weeks before the current presentation, lightheadedness associated with changing positions developed, as well as night sweats; fatigue persisted. On the morning of the current presentation, the patient had lightheadedness while lying down, and he presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nAt the other hospital, the patient reported ongoing lightheadedness. The temporal temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/68 mm Hg, the pulse 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 91.2 kg, the height 192 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.7. The conjunctivae were pale. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia and an elevated blood bilirubin level. The blood lactate dehydrogenase level was greater than 2500 U per liter (reference range, 135 to 225).

Intravenous fluids were administered, and the pulse decreased to 100 beats per minute. Oral doxycycline was administered for possible tickborne illness. One unit of packed red cells was transfused, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported that the lightheadedness had abated. He had no history of fever, hematuria, blood in the stool, or bleeding from other sites. He worked as a carpenter and spent minimal time outside. He lived with his parents and brother and had two cats and a dog. He took no medications. There were no known drug allergies. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His maternal grandmother had had lymphoma.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/64 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The results of pulmonary, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were normal. Areas of hypopigmentation of the skin were detected near the elbows, fingers, and feet. Cranial nerve function was intact, and strength was 5 out of 5 in the arms and legs.\nDr. Maria Y. Chen: Examination of a peripheral-blood smear (Figure 1) revealed evidence of macrocytic anemia with anisopoikilocytosis. Few white cells were present. There were neutrophils with variable segmentation and occasional immature forms, as well as platelets that were normal in terms of number and morphologic features.\nFIGURE 1\n\nPeripheral-Blood Smear.\nDr. Ouyang: A direct antiglobulin test was negative for IgG; C3 was detected on microscopic examination. Screening tests for Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA were negative.

    "user_input": "Dr. Kathy M. Tran: A 33-year-old pregnant woman with ulcerative colitis was admitted to this hospital during the summer at 10 weeks of gestation because of fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, and headache.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before this admission, when fever, rigors, nausea, and vomiting developed. During the next 3 days, the symptoms worsened; the patient was unable to eat, drink, or take medications. She reported abdominal pain and cramping on the left side that she described as being similar to previous flares of ulcerative colitis; she also had nonbloody diarrhea. The patient called the obstetrics clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems was notable for fatigue, mild headache, neck pain, and photophobia. The patient reported no hematochezia, pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, dysuria, or joint pain. Ulcerative colitis had been diagnosed 11 years earlier; at the time of the diagnosis, she began treatment with azathioprine but stopped after 1 year because of severe fatigue. The patient had taken mesalamine and sulfasalazine intermittently for disease flares but typically stopped after a few months of treatment. Exacerbations of ulcerative colitis occurred approximately every year and were associated with fevers, rigors, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea.\nNine months before this admission, Clostridioides difficile colitis developed, and the patient was successfully treated with oral vancomycin. Three weeks before the current admission, she was admitted to this hospital for a flare of ulcerative colitis; intravenous methylprednisolone, hydromorphone, and ondansetron were administered, and mesalamine was restarted. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed mild erythema and friable mucosa with a decreased vascular pattern in the sigmoid colon.\nDr. Craig R. Audin: A transvaginal ultrasound image obtained during that admission showed a single viable intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks of gestation and trace subchorionic hemorrhage.\nDr. Tran: The patient was discharged after 7 days once most of the symptoms had abated, although nausea persisted. The patient had had two previous successful pregnancies that had resulted in cesarean deliveries at full term. The patient reported that she had received all the usual childhood immunizations. Routine prenatal serologic screening during the current pregnancy showed immunity to varicella but not to rubella. Tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Other history included anemia, chronic back pain, migraines, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety.\nAt the time of the current admission, medications included prednisone, mesalamine, omeprazole, ondansetron, hydromorphone, tramadol, cyclobenzaprine, sumatriptan, gabapentin, lorazepam, sertraline, pyridoxine, cholecalciferol, and prenatal vitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with her male partner, with whom she was monogamous, as well as her two children. She worked as an administrator. She did not eat sushi or rare or raw meat, and she did not consume unpasteurized milk or cheese. She had no known sick contacts or exposure to animals. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. Her mother had coronary artery disease, her father inflammatory bowel disease, and her sister depression. Her brother and two children were well.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 118/61 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared tired and uncomfortable. The abdominal examination was remarkable for a healed surgical scar; there was diffuse tenderness that was most painful in the lower quadrants. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level was 7.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), which was similar to the patient\u2019s baseline level. Urinalysis was normal. Blood specimens were obtained for microbiologic culture.

There was trace fluid in the right lower quadrant; however, the appendix was not visualized (Figure 1B).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Abdomen.\nDr. Tran: Intravenous fluids, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and hydromorphone were administered; mesalamine was continued, and a tapering of the prednisone dose was begun. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and care.\nThe next day, the abdominal pain persisted and was most severe in the right upper and right lower quadrants. The headache had increased in severity; it was pulsating in quality and was worst in the frontal region, with radiation to the occipital region and posterior neck. There was mild photophobia but no neck stiffness or limitation in the range of motion in the neck. Empirical treatment with intravenous ampicillin\u2013sulbactam and prophylaxis with oral vancomycin were started.\nOn the third hospital day, the systolic blood pressure declined to 70 mm Hg; after intravenous fluids were administered, the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Ultrasound images of the uterus obtained at the bedside confirmed a fetal heartbeat. A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless, with a glucose level of 63 mg per deciliter (3.5 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a protein level of 17 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were 0 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5). Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF revealed no neutrophils and very few mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified.\nDr. Audin: Three days later, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1C through 1F), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a normal gravid uterus. On T2-weighted imaging, there were rounded areas of myometrial thickening with low signal intensity that were consistent with focal myometrial contractions, as well as a thin band of low signal intensity surrounding the fetus that was consistent with chorioamniotic separation; both of these findings were considered to be normal in the first trimester. The appendix was normal, without wall thickening, dilatation, or adjacent inflammatory changes. Although evaluation of the bowel was limited in the absence of oral and intravenous contrast material, the rectum also appeared normal, without obvious signs of active or chronic inflammation.\nA diagnosis was made.",

Claudia Wu: A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital of the Chinese University of Hong Kong because of abdominal pain and diarrhea.\nThe patient had been well until 6 months before this admission, when colicky, diffuse abdominal pain developed. She also had nonbloody diarrhea that occurred up to 10 times daily. During the subsequent 6 months, the patient noticed decreased appetite and weight loss of 5 kg. The symptoms did not abate, and her family encouraged her to seek medical evaluation.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported gradually darkening skin on the face, arms, and legs, as well as hair thinning and changes in the appearance of all the fingernails and toenails during the previous 4 months. There was no nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, hematochezia, fevers, or night sweats.\nThe patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Ten months before this admission, she had sought evaluation by a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner because of irregular menses. She was given a \u201chomemade\u201d traditional Chinese medicine that contained unknown ingredients. The patient took the remedy for 4 months and stopped taking it when the abdominal pain and diarrhea developed 6 months before this admission. She did not take other medications and had no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband and son in an urban area of Hong Kong, and she did not work outside the home. She did not vape or smoke cigarettes, and she did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother and father were healthy; there was no family history of gastroenterologic, autoimmune, or hereditary diseases.\nOn evaluation, the temporal temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg, and the heart rate 85 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20. Examinations of the thyroid, heart, and lungs were normal. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Moderate pitting edema was observed in the lower legs, up to the mid-calf.\nDr. W.S. Agnes Chan: On dermatologic examination, the patient had patchy hair loss, with a large patch of alopecia at the vertex of the scalp; there was no scarring of the scalp (Figure 1A). A hair-pull test (in which 40 to 60 strands of closely grouped hair are gently pulled, with more than 10% of hairs pulled out indicating a positive result) was negative. There were symmetric brown macules over the lateral lower cheeks and malar regions of the face (Figure 1B and 1C), and hyperpigmentation and diffuse brown-gray macules were observed over the palms and the palmar aspects of the fingers (Figure 1D and 1E). Onychodystrophy was present on all the fingernails (Figure 1E) and toenails. There was onycholysis with distal separation of the nail plates from the nail beds, thinned nail plates, distal nail-plate crumbling, and onychomadesis with proximal separation of the nail plates from the nail matrices (Figure 1E and 1F).\nFIGURE 1\n\nPhotographs of the Scalp and Skin.\nDr. Wu: The blood level of hemoglobin was 10.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 11.9 to 15.1) with a low mean corpuscular volume. The white-cell count, C-reactive protein level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in blood were normal. The blood level of potassium was 2.9 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.5 to 5.0), ionized calcium 0.85 mmol per liter (reference range, 1.13 to 1.32), phosphate 0.52 mmol per liter (reference range, 0.72 to 1.43), and zinc 8.8 \u03bcmol per liter (reference range, 10.7 to 18.0). The blood level of albumin was 14 g per liter (reference range, 33 to 48). The protein level in a spot urine sample was normal. A stool culture showed normal enteric flora. Testing of a stool specimen for Clostridium difficile antigen and Shiga toxin was negative, as was a stool examination for ova and parasites.

    "user_input": "Dr. Kaitlyn R. Shank (Medicine): A 46-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of hyperglycemia that was refractory to insulin therapy.\nFive years before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus after nausea, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia had developed. At that time, the weight was 113 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 45.6. Treatment with metformin was started, along with subcutaneous insulin glargine at a dose of 10 units daily. The patient had adverse effects associated with metformin, so treatment with metformin was discontinued and glipizide was started. During the next 3.5 years, despite progressive weight loss, the patient\u2019s glycemic control worsened, which resulted in gradual intensification of her glucose-lowering regimen.\nTwo years before the current presentation, the patient moved to the Boston area and established care at a clinic affiliated with another hospital. The weight was 63 kg, and the BMI was 25.4. Medications for diabetes included subcutaneous insulin glargine (20 units daily) and glipizide, and the glycated hemoglobin level was 13.2% (reference range, 4.3 to 5.6). Treatment with empagliflozin was started but then stopped because of a urinary tract infection. The dose of subcutaneous insulin glargine was increased to 30 units daily, and treatment with subcutaneous insulin lispro, administered at a dose of 10 units three times a day with meals, was added. Treatment with glipizide was stopped, and treatment with glimepiride and pioglitazone was started.\nOne year before the current presentation, the weight was 48 kg, and the BMI was 19.4. Medications for diabetes included subcutaneous insulin glargine (34 units daily), subcutaneous insulin lispro (15 units three times a day with meals), glimepiride, and pioglitazone, and the glycated hemoglobin level was 14.0%. Anorexia had developed, along with fatigue. Although the patient reported eating very little, the blood glucose levels remained markedly elevated.\nNine months before the current presentation, the weight was 42 kg, and the BMI was 16.9. Medications for diabetes included subcutaneous insulin glargine (46 units daily), subcutaneous insulin lispro (20 units three times a day with meals), glimepiride, and pioglitazone, and the glycated hemoglobin level was 11.0%.\nSix months before the current presentation, persistent abdominal pain developed, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly did not show evidence of obstruction, perforation, or abscess. The abdominal pain was attributed to gastroparesis; treatment with gabapentin, metoclopramide, and oxycodone was started. During the hospitalization, the patient was found to have profound hyperglycemia without diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome. The glycated hemoglobin level was 15.5%. Testing was negative for antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase, islet antigen 2, and zinc transporter 8. A diagnosis of lipodystrophy was considered. Treatment with human regular U-500 insulin, given in daily doses of 250 units with breakfast and 200 units each with lunch and dinner, was started; treatment with subcutaneous insulin glargine and subcutaneous insulin lispro was stopped. The patient was discharged home. Subsequent to this hospitalization, a gastric-emptying study reportedly showed normal emptying at 1 hour.\nTwo months before the current presentation, the abdominal pain worsened, and the patient was again admitted to the other hospital. Her hyperglycemia was initially treated with continuous intravenous insulin at doses of up to 40 units per hour. When the blood glucose level improved, treatment with intravenous insulin was stopped. Treatment with human regular U-500 insulin was then resumed at an increased dose (550 units each with breakfast and lunch and 450 units with dinner); treatment with isophane insulin, also known as neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, was started at a dose of 80 units twice a day. The abdominal pain subsided with improved glycemic control, and the patient was discharged home.\nOver the course of the 2 months between hospital discharge and the current presentation, the patient had five additional admissions to the other hospital because of abdominal pain and hyperglycemia. During each admission, the hyperglycemia was treated with high-dose intravenous insulin, the abdominal pain abated with improved blood glucose levels, and the patient was discharged home. During one admission, endoscopy was performed and reportedly revealed erosive gastritis and duodenitis due to infection with Helicobacter pylori, for which the patient was treated with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, bismuth subsalicylate, and pantoprazole.\nNine days before the current presentation, the abdominal pain worsened, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of the other hospital. Treatment with intravenous insulin was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, treatment with intravenous insulin was stopped, and treatment with human regular U-500 insulin was resumed at an increased dose of 650 units each with breakfast and lunch and 600 units with dinner; treatment with NPH insulin was also restarted at a dose of 80 units twice a day. She was transferred to this hospital for further care.\nOn arrival at this hospital, the patient reported constant epigastric abdominal pain. She also reported that she had been administering her subcutaneous insulin medications at home without missed doses and confirmed that she had been rotating the injection sites on her abdomen. Other medical history included depression, as well as anemia and leukopenia; a bone marrow biopsy performed 7 months earlier revealed mild-to-moderate fibrosis with patchy myxoid degeneration. She had numbness and tingling in the hands and feet that had begun 9 months before the current presentation. Her menses had stopped 14 months before the current presentation. Other medications included acetaminophen, fluoxetine, gabapentin, glipizide, hydromorphone, lorazepam, mirtazapine, oxycodone, pancrelipase, pantoprazole, and pioglitazone. She had no known drug allergies. The patient was Black and lived in Boston with her husband and children; she had previously worked as a chef but was not working at the time of the current presentation. She rarely drank alcohol or smoked marijuana and had never smoked tobacco; she did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes, and her father had liver disease.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 108/78 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 42 kg, and the BMI was 17.0. The patient appeared cachectic with a diffuse absence of body fat and muscle mass. Her face had acromegaly-like features, including broadening of the nose and thickening of the lips (Figure 1). Acanthosis nigricans was present, most notably in the neck and axillae. She had skin tags on the face and neck, and vitiligo was present on the ears and on the fingers of the right hand. The abdomen was soft, nondistended, and diffusely tender on palpation, without rebound or guarding; there was no hepatosplenomegaly. There was skin breakdown in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs.\nLaboratory testing showed a fasting blood glucose level of 311 mg per deciliter (17.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 100 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter]) and a C-peptide level of 12.1 ng per milliliter (reference range, 1.1 to 4.4). Blood levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, total complement, C3, and C4 were normal. The blood level of leptin was undetectable, and the blood level of adiponectin was 24.5 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 2.9 to 30.4). A screening test for human immunodeficiency virus was negative. Testing for antibodies to nuclear antigens was positive at a titer of 1:320 with a homogeneous pattern; testing for antibodies to double-stranded DNA was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a normal pattern with a mild diffuse increase in the gamma globulin level. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

    "user_input": "Dr. Suma Babu: A 67-year-old man was evaluated in the sleep clinic at this hospital because of odd behaviors during sleep, daytime sleepiness, and apnea detected on a home sleep study.\nThree years before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that the patient had vocalizations, including talking and yelling, while sleeping. He also had thrashing movements while sleeping; he fell out of bed more than once and inadvertently hit his wife during these movements.\nTwo years before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that the patient had prolonged episodes of daytime sleepiness. During the episodes, he appeared to fall asleep while sitting up and was unresponsive to shaking and loud voices; several hours later, he returned to normal interaction without any intervention. The daytime sleepiness was intermittent and fluctuated in severity.\nFour months before the current evaluation, the patient fell asleep while washing dishes. This resulted in a fall and unstable C1 spinal fracture, which required urgent surgical repair. After the surgical repair, melatonin and trazodone were prescribed for insomnia, and abnormal movements during sleep abated. However, vocalizations during sleep \u2014 including singing, talking, and expression of fear and anger in the context of upsetting dreams \u2014 continued and were most prominent in the early morning hours.\nThe patient also had a motor neurologic syndrome that had started before the onset of sleep symptoms, approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation. Symptoms included progressive gait imbalance with falls, hand clumsiness, hoarse voice, and dysphagia. Serial neurologic examinations, performed over a 3-year period by multiple neuromuscular specialists, revealed slow progression of generalized fasciculations and the development of bulbar hyperreflexia, postural instability, and hypophonia, although strength in the arms and legs remained intact. Serial electromyography revealed progressive and widespread involvement of muscles showing chronic reinnervation changes, including eventual involvement of craniobulbar muscles (tongue and masseter muscles).\nDr. Brian Zhao: One year before the current evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine revealed moderate neural foraminal narrowing at the level of C3\u2013C4 bilaterally and no central canal stenosis. Four months before the current evaluation, MRI of the head revealed a punctate subacute infarct in the left posterior centrum semiovale, chronic infarcts in the left middle frontal gyrus and right cerebellum, and nonspecific moderate-to-severe white-matter changes (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Babu: Blood tests for paraneoplastic, nutritional, and paraproteinemic causes of the patient\u2019s neurologic syndrome were unrevealing. A diagnosis of slowly progressive motor neuron disease was made, and therapy with riluzole was begun. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study revealed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with laryngeal penetration and silent aspiration; a gastrostomy tube was placed, and tube feeding was initiated.\nThe patient underwent a home sleep-apnea test, which showed sleep-disordered breathing with an apnea\u2013hypopnea index of 20 events per hour; hypoxemia was present at rest while he was breathing ambient air. Severe oxygen desaturation occurred with frequent respiratory events while he was asleep in the supine position. The patient was then referred to the sleep clinic for an initial evaluation.\nOn evaluation in the sleep clinic, the patient reported that obstructive sleep apnea had been diagnosed on the basis of a home sleep study performed 1 year earlier. Multiple attempts at treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) had been unsuccessful; there had been difficulty in finding a mask that fit comfortably.\nIn addition to the sleep and motor neurologic syndrome described previously, the patient\u2019s symptoms included snoring, difficulty with sleep initiation, forgetfulness, poor judgment regarding his ability to safely complete physical tasks, urinary urgency and frequency, and night sweats. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was well controlled with insulin and had been complicated by mild, stable, length-dependent sensory polyneuropathy; other history included hyperlipidemia, a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, depression, orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included alprazolam, bupropion, fenofibrate, insulin, melatonin, metformin, riluzole, sertraline, and trazodone; there were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in New England with his wife. He was a retired engineer. He drank two alcoholic beverages per day. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had died from an unknown cause at an elderly age; his father had died from trauma. One of his brothers had cerebrovascular disease, and another had schizophrenia.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 112/60 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.2. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented, although his attention was somewhat diminished. He could recall two words out of three. Naming and repetition were intact. The pupils were equally reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements were intact, and visual fields were full. Facial sensation and strength were normal. Speech was hypophonic and mildly slurred. Elevation of the palate was symmetric, and movement of the tongue was normal. Shoulder shrug was symmetric. Strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups. Deep-tendon reflexes were brisk in the arms, with mild spasticity in the legs. Plantar responses were normal. Vibratory sensation in the legs was mildly diminished. Results of finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing were normal. There were mild myoclonic movements in both hands. Alternating movements were mildly clumsy. Tone was slightly increased in the legs. The gait was on a narrow base and was unsteady; the patient was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg test showed truncal titubation.\nA sleep study to determine the appropriate positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy was performed. In CPAP mode, there was good control of respiratory events. Electromyographic signals revealed elevated muscle tone during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, but there were no abnormal behaviors.\nTwo weeks later, during a follow-up visit in the neuromuscular clinic, the patient became unresponsive to sternal rub; the vital signs and blood glucose level were normal. He was transported to the emergency department, where he returned to a normal level of consciousness without intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed frequent intermittent diffuse polymorphic delta slowing of the background, often with bifrontal predominance, but showed no epileptiform abnormalities. The patient was fitted with a mask for CPAP, and treatment was initiated. Several weeks after the initiation of treatment, download of CPAP data revealed good effectiveness and adherence.\nHowever, episodes of unresponsiveness increased in frequency and lasted up to 3 hours at a time. During the episodes, the patient\u2019s wife was unable to arouse him despite performing a sternal rub. Modafinil was prescribed, but the episodes did not abate. The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for long-term monitoring and EEG. During the admission, two episodes of unresponsiveness occurred, during which the patient had a normal blood pressure, heart rate, and glucose level and EEG revealed findings consistent with sleep.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Daryl J. Selen: A 29-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent bone fractures and hypophosphatemia.\nThe patient had been well until 19 months before admission, when pain in the right midfoot developed during a vacation in Europe. On her return to the United States, she was evaluated by her primary care physician at a clinic affiliated with another hospital; an orthotic device was recommended, but the foot pain did not decrease with use of the device.\nThree months later, the pain in the right foot increased in severity after a second vacation in Europe. Radiography of the right foot reportedly revealed no fracture; physical therapy was recommended. During the subsequent 8 months, the pain continued to gradually increase in severity, was worse when the patient stood upright or walked, and was relieved with the administration of ibuprofen.\nEight months before admission, the patient tripped, and the severity of pain in the right foot increased suddenly. She was evaluated in the orthopedic clinic of this hospital. On examination, the height was 173 cm, the weight 115 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 38.6. There was tenderness over the right third metatarsal. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Rene Balza: Radiography of the right foot (Figure 1A) revealed a fracture of the third metatarsal shaft. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right foot revealed a nondisplaced, incompletely healed transverse fracture of the third metatarsal shaft, as well as subchondral sclerosis and bone marrow edema within the distal navicular bone and in the calcaneocuboid joint. Bone stimulation was recommended, but the patient\u2019s pain did not abate after these treatments.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies of the Foot and Sacrum.\nDr. Selen: Seven months before admission, the patient had increased pain in the right foot after a fall while walking on ice. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Balza: Radiography of the right foot (Figure 1B) revealed fractures of the distal fourth and fifth metatarsals.\nDr. Selen: Five months before admission, the second metatarsal region of the right foot was tender on palpation after the patient had walked up a flight of stairs. However, no evidence of a fracture was seen on radiography.\nFour months before admission, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. The calcium level was 9.5 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level 26 ng per milliliter (65 nmol per liter; reference range, 20 to 80 ng per deciliter [50 to 200 nmol per liter]), and the parathyroid hormone level 45 pg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 60); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, performed for the assessment of bone mineral density, revealed normal bone mass in the lumbar spine (z score, 0.0; reference range, 1.9 to \u22121.9) and in the femoral neck (z score, 0.4; reference range, 1.9 to \u22121.9). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation and weight loss were recommended.

A controlled ankle motion walking boot and crutches were recommended for ambulation.\nDr. Selen: During the next 3 months, the pain in the right foot persisted, and new pain developed in the left foot. The patient was seen in the pain medicine and podiatry clinics affiliated with the other hospital. Diagnoses of plantar fasciitis, Achilles\u2019 tendinitis, and sinus tarsi syndrome were considered. Treatment with methylprednisolone and celecoxib was initiated, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital.\nOn evaluation in the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported bilateral foot and ankle pain and swelling that was greater in the right foot and ankle than in the left, as well as stiffness and warmth in the ankles. There was lower back pain and bilateral hip pain, which was greater on the right side than on the left side. The patient reported that the back and hip pain had been present since she was a teenager but had gradually increased in severity during the previous year. Fatigue and generalized weakness had developed and worsened during the previous month. There was no fever, weight loss, or change in diet.\nMenarche had occurred when the patient was 11 years of age, and menstrual cycles had been regular since then. There was a history of fractures of the left wrist in childhood. Other medical history included obesity, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, nephrolithiasis, biliary dyskinesia (which had led to cholecystectomy 1 year before this admission), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosed on the basis of a liver biopsy. Medications included celecoxib, ergocalciferol, citalopram, and lorazepam; she had no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England and had previously worked as a nurse; however, she was unable to work during the previous 8 months because of pain and difficulty with ambulation. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had osteopenia; her mother, father, and sister had psoriasis; her father had psoriatic arthritis; and her brother had the Williams syndrome, a rare genetic and developmental disorder.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 121/78, and the heart rate 94 beats per minute. Dentition was normal, and the gait was antalgic. Proximal muscle strength was intact in both arms (5/5) and slightly reduced in the legs (4/5). There was tenderness over the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints that was more pronounced on the right side than on the left side. The FABER test \u2014 in which the leg is flexed and the thigh is abducted and externally rotated \u2014 elicited pain in both hips. There was tenderness over the right midfoot and warmth and swelling of the ankles. No musculoskeletal deformities, bowing of the legs, lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, or rashes were noted. The blood level of phosphorus was 1.0 mg per deciliter (0.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter]); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was instructed to go to the emergency department of this hospital. Intravenous sodium phosphate and oral potassium phosphate were administered. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Balza: Radiography of the lumbar spine, pelvis, hips, and ankles revealed anterolisthesis of L4 and L5 with a defect in the pars interarticularis; there were no fractures. On radiography of the right foot, a fracture in the third metatarsal was initially identified 8 months before admission (Figure 1A), followed by the development of fractures in the fourth and fifth metatarsals 1 month later (Figure 1B). Subsequently, T2-weighted MRI of the sacrum with fat suppression performed on admission (Figure 1E and 1F) revealed vertically oriented hypointense bands in the bilateral sacral alae and a horizontally oriented hypointense band in S2, as well as bone marrow edema adjacent to the fracture lines; the combination of these findings was consistent with an H-shaped sacral insufficiency fracture.\nDr. Selen: The patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Natasha Merali (Medicine): A 76-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of lethargy and altered mental status.\nThe patient had been well until 2 months before this evaluation, when she was admitted to another hospital for community-acquired pneumonia. Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin was administered, and her condition partially improved.\nTwo weeks later, the patient presented to the other hospital with recurrent dyspnea and lethargy. A partly loculated right pleural effusion was identified. Empirical treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered intravenously. Thoracostomy (placement of a chest tube for drainage) was performed, and pleural fluid analysis revealed an exudative pleural effusion; Gram\u2019s staining showed no neutrophils or microorganisms, culture showed no growth, and cytologic testing showed no malignant cells. After a 1-week admission, the dyspnea abated, and the patient was discharged with instructions to complete a 2-week course of antibiotic therapy.\nTwo weeks before this evaluation, generalized weakness and lethargy developed, along with new diffuse headache. The patient\u2019s family thought that she appeared somnolent and \u201cclumsy\u201d while walking. Four days later, her family took her to the other hospital for evaluation. A review of systems was notable for dyspnea, leg edema, and hematochezia and no fever, chills, chest pain, cough, dysuria, hematuria, or melena. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 176/101 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented but appeared to be confused when recalling recent events. She had jugular venous distention, diffuse lung rales, and 2+ symmetric pitting edema of the lower legs up to the knees. The blood urea nitrogen level was 83 mg per deciliter (29.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 20 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 7.1 mmol per liter]), the creatinine level 4.9 mg per deciliter (433 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.4 to 1.1 mg per deciliter [35 to 97 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the hematocrit 26% (reference range, 34 to 45).

Gilberto Gonzalez: Chest radiography revealed a small right pleural effusion and moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a chronic subcortical infarct of the right frontal lobe, as well as diffuse involutional changes and nonspecific white-matter hypodensities.\nDr. Merali: Oral labetalol, clonidine, and hydralazine and intravenous furosemide were administered to treat possible hypertensive emergency. During the next 2 days, the patient\u2019s headache and anemia worsened and dizziness developed. On the seventh hospital day, there was an acute episode of nonbloody emesis, followed by a generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure lasting 1 minute. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital.\nDr. Gonzalez: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed findings similar to those of the previous study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed two foci of restricted diffusion in the right frontal lobe and the left cerebellar hemisphere, each measuring 1 cm in diameter, with surrounding signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. In addition, there was diffuse ventricular enlargement, with surrounding smooth hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR images; this finding is suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). T2-weighted and FLAIR images also showed multiple foci of hyperintensity scattered throughout the deep white matter.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Merali: Video electroencephalography revealed epileptiform discharges predominantly in the frontal lobe, with generalized slowing. Levetiracetam, vancomycin, and ceftazidime were administered; intermittent hemodialysis was initiated.\nDuring the next 3 days, the patient began to have a right gaze preference, left hemineglect, and aphasia. The temperature increased to 39.4\u00b0C, and chills developed. Blood specimens were obtained for microbiologic culture. Lumbar puncture was deferred, pending additional imaging studies to rule out a space-occupying lesion. Empirical treatment with vancomycin, ceftazidime, ampicillin, metronidazole, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. At the request of her family, the patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital.\nOn arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family. Two years earlier, the patient had received a diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, which was treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin. Therapy was discontinued after three of six cycles because of ileus, renal injury, and neutropenic fever. Robotic subtotal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were then performed; histologic examination of the resected tissue revealed a nearly complete response of the adenocarcinoma. Five months before the current evaluation, CT with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography performed at the other hospital revealed FDG avidity in nonenlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, retroperitoneum, porta hepatis, and right cervical region. Biopsy was offered, but the patient chose to undergo active surveillance. Additional medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and stage 5 chronic kidney disease. Medications included torsemide, amlodipine, clonidine, hydralazine, hydrochlorothiazide, labetalol, rosuvastatin, insulin, levothyroxine, cholecalciferol, mirtazapine, and oxycodone. There were no known drug allergies.\nFour decades before the current admission, the patient had immigrated to the United States from an island off the west coast of Africa. She was widowed, had four children, and lived with a pet parrot in an urban area of New England. Two months before hospitalization, she had been independent in activities of daily living and had received minimal assistance, such as with buying groceries, from family members. The patient had traveled to her country of origin 8 years earlier and to South America and the Caribbean in the past year. She had had no sexual partners in the past three decades. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her sister had received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at 60 years of age; there was no family history of rheumatologic, neurologic, cardiovascular, or renal disease.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure 170/92 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.8. The patient was somnolent and variably oriented to self but not to situation, location, or time. She intermittently opened her eyes spontaneously but did not follow commands or reliably withdraw in response to noxious stimuli. Her face and pupils appeared symmetric; a right gaze preference and left hemineglect were present. There was no evidence of jugular venous distention, rales, or edema, and the abdominal examination was normal.\nTesting for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2 antibodies and p24 antigen was nonreactive. A test for antitreponemal antibodies was positive, and a rapid plasma reagin test was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Gonzalez: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed foci of hypoattenuation in the left superior cerebellar hemisphere and the right frontal lobe that corresponded to the foci of restricted diffusion on MRI observed at the other hospital.\nDr. Merali: Empirical treatment with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, metronidazole, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. On the second hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 15 cm of water. The CSF was slightly yellow, with a glucose level of 18 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a protein level of 173 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were 236 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 69% were neutrophils, 19% lymphocytes, and 12% monocytes. Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF showed abundant neutrophils and mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed mild left ventricular hypokinesis and aortic sclerosis.\nOn the fourth hospital day, new right esophoria developed and the patient was less responsive. The trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation was initiated for airway protection.\nDr. Gonzalez: Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed enlargement of the previously observed lesions in the right frontal lobe and left cerebellum. There were additional foci of reduced diffusivity, with corresponding hyperintense signal abnormalities on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, involving both cerebral hemispheres, deep gray matter, the brain stem, and the cerebellum. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal narrowing of branches of the bilateral middle and posterior cerebral arteries. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and no other abnormalities.\nFIGURE 2\n\nAdditional MRI of the Head.\nDr. Merali: Empirical treatment with methylprednisolone was started. The next day, repeat lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 16 cm of water. The CSF was slightly yellow, with a glucose level of 179 mg per deciliter (9.9 mmol per liter) and a protein level of 181 mg per deciliter. There were 286 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 83% were neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, and 8% monocytes. Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF showed abundant neutrophils and moderate mononuclear cells; there were no organisms.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Peter W. Croughan (Medicine): A 67-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, myalgias, and one previous episode of vomiting.\nNine months before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital with cough and shortness of breath, and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia was diagnosed. He received remdesivir, dexamethasone, and supplemental oxygen, which was delivered through a high-flow nasal cannula. His clinical condition gradually improved, and he was discharged home with supplemental oxygen, which was to be administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute.\nWhile the patient was recovering at home, cough persisted and shortness of breath worsened, despite treatment with prednisone. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital, organizing pneumonia was diagnosed. Pulmonary-function testing revealed a severe restrictive ventilatory defect with impaired gas exchange, and findings on computed tomography (CT) of the chest were consistent with organizing pneumonia superimposed on fibrotic interstitial lung disease. Treatment with pirfenidone and mycophenolate mofetil was initiated, and the dose of prednisone was increased. Despite the use of these treatments, there was no decrease in dyspnea; consequently, treatment with pirfenidone was stopped, and the dose of prednisone was tapered over the course of the 2 months before the current admission. Because of persistent severe dyspnea on exertion, the patient was listed for lung transplantation 2 weeks before the current admission.\nTwo days before the current admission, myalgias and nausea developed, and an episode of vomiting occurred. The tympanic temperature, as measured by the patient at home, was 40.0\u00b0C. There was also a slight increase in shortness of breath, and the patient began to administer supplemental oxygen at an increased rate of 5 liters per minute. One day before the current admission, a home test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen was negative. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported a chronic dry cough that was unchanged. Other medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and prostate cancer that had been treated surgically 4 years before this admission. Medications included albuterol, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, ipratropium\u2013albuterol delivered by nebulizer, mycophenolate mofetil, pantoprazole, prednisone, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. He had no known drug allergies. He drank three or four alcoholic drinks per week and was a lifelong nonsmoker. He lived in a rural area of New England on five acres of land with woods. He used well water at home, but he boiled drinking water before consumption. He owned a dog, and he spent time outdoors, including mowing the lawn 1 week before this admission. He had had mosquito bites but no known tick bites. He was retired from previous work as a welder.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/67 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.8. Respirations were slightly labored, and the patient spoke in short sentences. He was alert and oriented and answered questions appropriately. No oral thrush was present. There were crackles at the bases of both lung fields. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Urinalysis results were normal. The blood level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60), and the blood galactomannan index was 0.13 (reference range, 0.00 to 0.49). Tests for Lyme disease and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A respiratory viral panel that included testing for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids was negative.

CT of the chest (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed resolution of multifocal air-space opacities and new peripheral curvilinear opacity. There was peripheral reticulation that was unchanged from that seen in the studies obtained 7 and 9 months earlier, basilar-predominant architectural distortion, and traction bronchiectasis with evidence of honeycombing in the lung bases. There was a slight decrease in mediastinal lymphadenopathy as compared with the earlier studies and a single new paraesophageal lymph node on the right side.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Chest on Admission.\nDr. Croughan: Blood and urine cultures were obtained, and treatment with intravenous cefepime was initiated.

One liter of intravenous fluids was administered, and the blood pressure increased to 108/52 mm Hg. Owing to the patient\u2019s acute illness, the dose of prednisone was increased, and he was admitted to the hospital.\nOn hospital day 1, fever persisted; the maximum temporal temperature was 39.9\u00b0C.

    "user_input": "Dr. Nilay K. Patel: A 62-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of recurrent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 months before the current admission, when pleuritic pain and tightness in her chest developed suddenly while she was eating. The chest pain persisted and began to radiate to the neck and back. The symptoms did not abate with aspirin or acetaminophen. Within an hour after symptom onset, she noticed that the pain worsened with exertion and when she was in the supine position; she was also unable to take a full breath and had dizziness with exertion. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 104 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/91 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Except for the finding of tachycardia, the examination was reportedly normal. The prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Other Hospital), 3 Mo before This Admission (Other Hospital), Reference Range (This Hospital), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201315.8, 14.9, 12.0\u201316.0, 12.4\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201348.0, 44.7, 36.0\u201346.0, 40.1\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4800\u201311,200, 6900, 4500\u201311,000, 8090\n\nDifferential count (%):\nNeutrophils, \u2014, \u2014, 40\u201370, 60.6\nLymphocytes, \u2014, \u2014, 22\u201344, 27.4\nMonocytes, \u2014, \u2014, 4\u201311, 8.9\nEosinophils, \u2014, \u2014, 0\u20138, 1.5\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 215,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 321,000\nN-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (pg/ml), 0\u2013900, 117, \u2014, \u2014\nTroponin I (ng/ml), <0.039, <0.030, \u2014, \u2014\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), \u2014, \u2014, 0\u201313, 15\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), \u2014, \u2014, <8.0, 4.5\n\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) reportedly showed ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion in the anterior and inferior leads. A chest radiograph reportedly showed a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Intravenous heparin was administered. Four hours later, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed according to a pulmonary embolism protocol, reportedly ruled out pulmonary embolism; it also revealed a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with an attenuation level of 34 to 50 Hounsfield units, a mildly dilated ascending aorta (at a diameter of 37 mm; normal diameter, <36 mm on the basis of the patient\u2019s sex and body-surface area), and a pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe that measured 4 mm in diameter. Intravenous heparin was stopped, and protamine sulfate was administered. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of a second hospital 3 hours later.\nOn arrival at the second hospital, the temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/75 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. Pulsus paradoxus measured 16 mm Hg. The jugular venous pressure was 12 cm of water. Auscultation revealed tachycardia and a pericardial friction rub. The remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the level of troponin were normal. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia and right-axis deviation, with minor nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities.\nDr. Daniela R. Crousillat: A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a small-to-moderate circumferential pericardial effusion primarily abutting the right atrium and right ventricle with right atrial inversion and intermittent diastolic inversion of the right ventricle (Figure 1A). There was increased respiratory variation in the mitral inflow velocities and a dilated inferior vena cava with reduced respirophasic collapse; both these features were suggestive of the presence of physiologic characteristics of early tamponade (Figure 1B and Video 1). Colchicine and ibuprofen were administered, and the patient was admitted to the second hospital.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies Obtained before This Admission.\nDr. Patel: The next morning, pericardiocentesis was performed under fluoroscopic guidance with the use of a subxiphoid approach, and 200 ml of bloody fluid was drained; the intrapericardial pressure decreased from 12 mm Hg to 4 mm Hg. Analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed 4,700,000 erythrocytes per microliter and 12,010 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 78% were neutrophils, 13% monocytes, 8% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. Gram\u2019s staining revealed neutrophils and no organisms. The pericardial fluid albumin level was 3.0 g per deciliter, the total protein level 4.7 g per deciliter, the lactate dehydrogenase level 614 U per liter, the glucose level 71 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter), and the amylase level 31 U per liter.\nDr. Vinit Baliyan: On the second hospital day, a CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest showed a reduction in hemopericardium, and a pericardial drain was visible; there was no aortic dissection. There was an atrial septal occluder device in place that appeared to be in an appropriate position. The device appeared to be relatively large and abutted the aortic root anteriorly (Figure 1C). However, there was no evidence of erosion of the device into the aortic wall (known as device erosion) or pseudoaneurysm formation (Figure 1D).\nDr. Patel: On the third hospital day, no pericardial effusion was detected on TTE. Cytologic analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed reactive mesothelial cells, neutrophils, histiocytes, and eosinophils, with no malignant cells. The patient was discharged home with prescriptions for colchicine and ibuprofen.\nTen days after discharge from the second hospital, the patient had a follow-up visit with her cardiologist and reported that the chest pain and dyspnea had resolved. The heart rate was 94 beats per minute, the blood pressure 159/88 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the examination was normal. The antinuclear antibody titer was 1:160, with a homogeneous pattern, and a test for rheumatoid factor was negative. CT of the chest, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small-volume pericardial effusion, mild bronchial wall thickening, and a 4-mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe. Colchicine treatment was stopped.\nSix weeks before the current admission, the patient called her primary care physician to report recurrent back pain and dyspnea that she noted were similar to her previous presentation; treatment with colchicine was resumed. During the next 12 days, sinus pressure, myalgias, nasal congestion, and cough productive of green sputum developed, and she was seen by her primary care physician. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, the blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 94% while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. A screening test for respiratory viruses was negative. A chest radiograph reportedly showed clear lungs. Doxycycline was prescribed.\nFour days before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by her cardiologist at this hospital and reported ongoing cough and dyspnea. The heart rate was 87 beats per minute, and the blood pressure was 138/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nDr. Crousillat: A TTE showed recurrence of a moderate pericardial effusion, measuring up to 14 mm in end diastole, that was adjacent to the right ventricular free wall. There was evidence of right ventricular diastolic inversion that was suggestive of the physiologic characteristics of tamponade (Figure 2A and 2B). The patient was admitted to the cardiology floor of this hospital.\nFIGURE 2\n\nEchocardiograms Obtained on This Admission.\nDr. Patel: On evaluation, the patient reported that she had had episodes of dyspnea and cough with sputum production and a decrease in exercise tolerance in the weeks before this admission. She had no known sick contacts.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for postoperative pulmonary embolism, hypertension, dyslipidemia, recurrent episodes of syncope with cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses on tilt testing, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (for which she used a continuous positive airway pressure device), obesity, tubular adenomas (colonic polyps), hepatic steatosis, hiatal hernia, osteopenia, and cataracts. She also had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; on previous pulmonary-function testing, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 0.92 liters (39% of the predicted value), and the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity was 47%.\nFive and a half years before the current admission, the patient had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and abdominoplasty that had resulted in postoperative hemorrhage; she had lost 44 kg of weight after the sleeve gastrectomy. Fourteen years before this admission, the patient had undergone percutaneous transcatheter closure of a fenestrated atrial septal defect (ASD) with an interatrial septal aneurysm and a right-to-left shunt that was possibly related to recurrent transient ischemic attacks; the procedure had been performed with a 30-mm Amplatzer septal occluder device. She had had mammography and cervical cancer screening within the 16 months before this admission.\nMedications included colchicine, apixaban, losartan, theophylline, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, a multivitamin, and inhaled tiotropium and mometasone\u2013formoterol, as well as furosemide and albuterol as needed. Topiramate had caused paresthesia. The patient lived in Massachusetts with her husband and was a business owner. She had a 40-pack-year history of cigarette smoking and had quit smoking 10 years earlier; she did not drink alcohol or use other substances. Her family history was notable for coronary artery disease in her mother and father, stroke in her maternal grandmother and paternal grandfather, and seizure in a nephew.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the heart rate 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Pulsus paradoxus measured 10 mm Hg. The height was 163 cm and the weight 67 kg; the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.2. On examination, the jugular venous pressure was 10 cm of water. Auscultation revealed tachycardia, with no murmur or rub. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An ECG showed irregular tachycardia of uncertain underlying rhythm, low voltage in the limb leads, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and a rightward axis.\nDiagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Dilara Hatipoglu (Medicine): A 33-year-old man was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of relapsing chronic diarrhea and a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy.\nDiarrhea had initially developed in the patient during infancy. When the patient was 2 months of age, he had poor growth and frequent bowel movements with loose stools. When he began to eat solid foods, diarrhea continued, and a hydrolyzed-protein diet was started. His parents were instructed to remove dairy, soy, and gluten from his diet, but diarrhea did not abate. Allergy skin-prick testing with cow\u2019s milk and soy antigens was negative.\nWhen the patient was 10 months of age, failure to thrive and diarrhea persisted, and generalized edema and nephrotic syndrome developed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and diffuse inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy reportedly showed mild degenerative changes of the surface epithelium and mild focal microvillous atrophy; there were no immune deposits, and the basement membrane was normal.\nRenal biopsy was also performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen revealed glomeruli with diffuse thickening of the basement membrane; there was no proliferation of cells or mesangial matrix. Transmission electron microscopy showed total effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes and an irregularly thickened glomerular basement membrane with numerous subepithelial and intramembranous electron-dense deposits. The patient received a working diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome due to membranous glomerulonephritis, and treatment with prednisone was started.\nDiarrhea abated, proteinuria and generalized edema resolved, and growth resumed. However, during the next 2 years, intermittent relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome occurred when the dose of prednisone was decreased. When the patient was 3 years of age, treatment with chlorambucil was started for recurrent membranous glomerulonephritis, and there were no relapses for 1 year.\nWhen the patient was 4 years of age, there was a recurrence of diarrhea associated with fever and hemolytic anemia. Stool culture, stool testing for Clostridioides difficile toxin, and examination of the stool for ova and parasites were all negative. EGD was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and active enteritis. The blood IgE level was 501 IU per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 100). The blood level of endomysial antibodies was not elevated, but anti\u2013epithelial cell antibodies were detected. The patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy, and treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was begun.\nAfter several months, treatment with glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was stopped, and tacrolimus was begun. Tacrolimus was stopped after several years, when the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved. From 5 to 13 years of age, he had no enteropathy, anemia, or nephropathy.\nBeginning at 13 years of age, the patient was hospitalized for recurrences of diarrhea and nephropathy every 2 to 4 years during the 20 years before this evaluation. Six years before this evaluation, EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the duodenal and colonic mucosa appeared diffusely edematous. Biopsy specimens were obtained.\nDr. Stuti G. Shroff: Examination of a duodenal biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed marked villous blunting, an increase in lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria (known as lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria), and a patchy increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. Examination of a colonic biopsy specimen revealed mild focal active colitis that spared the rectum.\nFIGURE 1\n\nSmall-Intestinal Biopsy Specimens.\nDr. Hatipoglu: Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was begun, and diarrhea abated. For the next 2 years, relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone in combination with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil.\nFour years before this evaluation, antibodies against the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor were not detected. Renal biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen again revealed evidence of membranous glomerulonephritis. Treatment was changed to prednisone, budesonide, and abatacept, and symptoms abated. After 2 years, the patient stopped taking abatacept. After another 2 years, diarrhea recurred, and the patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the gastroenterology clinic, additional history was obtained. There was a history of hypertension, gallstones, and rosacea. Eczema had developed when the patient was 10 months of age and had occurred intermittently into adulthood; it had abated with the administration of immunosuppressive agents. Anaphylactic shock had occurred when the patient was 2 years of age after he had been exposed to uncooked egg. At that time, allergy testing was performed, and the patient\u2019s parents were instructed to remove eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, and shellfish from his diet, in addition to removing dairy, soy, and gluten.\nCurrent medications included prednisone, budesonide, and losartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a Mid-Atlantic state and worked as a salesperson. He did not smoke tobacco and drank beer rarely. His family history included ovarian cancer in his mother and skin cancer in his father; his brother was healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/94 mm Hg, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.1. The patient had short stature and diffuse erythema of the face and neck. There was mild tenderness in the left lower abdomen. The results of a lactulose breath test were normal, as was the fecal calprotectin level. Testing for antibodies to tissue transglutaminase was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the findings were consistent with duodenitis, gastritis, and atrophy of the colon.

Diacovo (Pediatrics): An 11-year-old girl was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of redness of the eyes.\nThe patient had been well until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when she noticed mild eye redness, which was worse in the right eye than in the left eye. There was intermittent swelling of the eyelids but no photophobia, itching, pain, tearing, or discharge. The patient\u2019s parents administered naphazoline hydrochloride and glycerin eye drops, but the eye redness did not abate. When the eye redness had persisted for 2 weeks, the patient was taken to the pediatrics clinic of another hospital. She was given a 7-day course of an oral antibiotic agent as empirical treatment for possible preseptal cellulitis.\nFive weeks before the current evaluation, the eye redness persisted despite treatment, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital. The blood pressure was not measured during this evaluation. The visual acuity with correction was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination revealed abundant white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were also keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and rare iris nodules in the right eye. Funduscopic examination was notable for optic-disk swelling and peripheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes, as well as perivascular exudates in the right eye. Cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes were prescribed.\nDuring the subsequent 3 weeks, additional tests were performed in the pediatrics clinic of the other hospital. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, syphilis, and Lyme disease were negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was indeterminate. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

On evaluation, she described eye redness that had persisted but decreased in severity. She reported no fever, weight loss, night sweats, rash, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or joint pain. On examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 96/61 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.3.\nThe patient appeared well, with no oral lesions or rash. The visual acuity was unchanged. Slit-lamp examination revealed keratic precipitates and white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were extensive posterior synechiae in the right eye. Funduscopic examination (Figure 2) showed vitreous white cells, optic-disk swelling, perivascular exudates, peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nFIGURE 2\n\nFundus Photographs.\nDuring the next 4 days, additional tests were performed, and sputum specimens were obtained for an acid-fast bacilli smear and culture. Optical coherence tomography revealed optic-disk swelling but no cystoid macular swelling. Fluorescein angiography revealed optic-disk leakage with areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion and some vessel leakage.\nDr. Figueiro Longo: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1C), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed protrusion and enhancement of the optic disks and enhancement of the irises, a finding consistent with the clinical diagnosis of uveitis. There was no evidence of optic neuritis or perineuritis.\nDr. Diacovo: The administration of cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes was continued. Treatment with oral prednisone was started, and a regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was begun as empirical treatment for possible tuberculosis. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. She was instructed to follow up in the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital and was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the rheumatology clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient had had normal growth and development and was currently in middle school. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had emigrated from West Africa to the United States 6 years earlier; since then, she had lived with her mother and father in a suburban town in New England and had not traveled outside the region. Six months before this evaluation, an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for M. tuberculosis had been positive. At that time, the patient had received a prescription for a medication to treat latent tuberculosis infection; however, the patient\u2019s parents could not recall giving the medication to the patient. She was taking the prescribed cyclopentolate and prednisolone eye drops, oral prednisone, and regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. There were no known drug allergies.

Porterfield (Medicine): A 71-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of refractory hemolytic anemia.\nThe patient, who had recurrent breast cancer and diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, had been in her usual state of health until 7 months before the current admission, when fatigue and dyspnea on exertion developed. She was reportedly evaluated by a cardiologist and a pulmonologist, but no cause for her symptoms was identified.\nTwo months before the current admission, dyspnea on exertion worsened, palpitations and dizziness developed, and the patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. Laboratory studies revealed anemia, a low blood level of haptoglobin, and an elevated blood level of lactate dehydrogenase. The blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A peripheral-blood smear showed schistocytes. A direct antiglobulin test was negative, complement levels were reportedly low, and a low titer of cold agglutinins was present. Testing for antibodies against \u03b22-glycoprotein I and cardiolipin was negative, as was a screening test for lupus anticoagulant. Nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and other common respiratory viruses was negative. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood revealed no aberrant clonal population of cells and no evidence of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults, Other Hospital), 7 Wk before Admission (Other Hospital), Reference Range (Adults, This Hospital), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nHematocrit (%), 33.0\u201344.0, 20.8, 36.0\u201346.0, 14.8\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201316.0, 7.0, 12.0\u201316.0, 5.3\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4100\u20139300, 11,200, 4500\u201311,000, 13,340\n\nDifferential count (%):\nNeutrophils, 38\u201350, 52, 40.0\u201370.0, 82.1\nLymphocytes, 28\u201342, 12, 22.0\u201344.0, 13.4\nMonocytes, 4.0\u20138.5, 5.0, 4\u201311, 1.8\nEosinophils, 0\u20135, 0, 0\u20138, 0.9\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 130,000\u2013350,000, 230,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 43,000\nMean corpuscular volume (fl), 82.3\u201393.2, 106.7, 80.0\u2013100.0, 101.4\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin (pg), 22.2\u201333.2, 35.5, 26.0\u201334.0, 36.3\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (g/dl), 32.5\u201335.1, 33.7, 31.0\u201337.0, 35.8\nRed-cell distribution width (%), 12.0\u201315.0, 22.0, 11.5\u201314.5, 34.8\nReticulocyte count (%), 0.4\u20132.0, 13.4, 0.7\u20132.5, 15.8\nProthrombin time (sec), 9.4\u201312.3, 11.9, 11.5\u201314.5, 16.8\nProthrombin-time international normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.0, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.4\nActivated partial-thromboplastin time (sec), 23.6\u201332.9, 24.6, 22.0\u201336.0, 25.2\nFibrinogen (mg/dl), 172\u2013400, 330, 150\u2013400, 374\nD-dimer (ng/ml), <500, 5021, <500, 9321\nHaptoglobin (mg/dl), 25\u2013234, <15, 30\u2013200, <10\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/liter), 80\u2013225, 675, 110\u2013210, 5896\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), \u2014, \u2014, 10\u2013200, 18,050\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.1\u20131.2, 2.8, 0.0\u20131.0, 4.1\nDirect bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20130.3, 0.5, 0.0\u20130.4, 0.4\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.5\u20135.2, 4.4, 3.3\u20135.0, 3.8\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 6\u201360, 36, 7\u201333, 58\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 5\u201345, 68, 9\u201332, 135\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 30\u2013115, 39, 30\u2013100, 77\n\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy that was unchanged from that observed on imaging performed 2 years earlier. Packed red cells were transfused, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Treatment with glucocorticoids was initiated for a working diagnosis of Coombs\u2019-negative autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\nOn the third hospital day, anemia persisted, and additional units of packed red cells were transfused. The blood pressure had increased from 118/62 mm Hg on admission to 150/60 mm Hg. Treatment with glucocorticoids was stopped, and treatment with captopril was initiated for a working diagnosis of scleroderma renal crisis. Blood testing for the level of ADAMTS13 activity was performed, and on the sixth hospital day, treatment with plasmapheresis was started for the possible diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient underwent a total of six sessions of plasmapheresis during the first 2 weeks of the hospitalization.\nDuring the second week of the hospitalization, treatment with eculizumab was initiated. The patient received packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days for ongoing hemolytic anemia. The results of the blood test for activity of ADAMTS13 returned; the activity level was 65% (reference value, >67%), and treatment with plasmapheresis was stopped.\nDuring the third week of the hospitalization, treatment with eculizumab was continued, and treatment with rituximab was initiated; however, the patient still received packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days. During the fourth week of the hospitalization, weekly treatment with both eculizumab and rituximab was continued, and a 3-day course of intravenous immune globulin was administered. Despite this treatment, there was no reduction in hemolysis.\nDuring the fifth week of the hospitalization, the patient continued to receive packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days, and thrombocytopenia developed. Treatment with glucocorticoids was resumed, and treatment with twice-weekly injections of epoetin alfa was initiated. A biopsy specimen of the bone marrow reportedly showed hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and erythroid predominance.\nDuring the sixth week of the hospitalization, the need for red-cell transfusion persisted, treatment with cyclophosphamide was initiated, and the dose of captopril was increased. During the seventh week of the hospitalization, acute kidney injury (AKI) developed, and treatment with captopril and glucocorticoids was stopped. On the 50th hospital day, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported nausea, poor appetite, and weight loss of 9 kg during the past 2 months. She also reported that her urine had appeared pink or cola-colored after each transfusion of packed red cells.\nTwenty-one years earlier, localized clinical stage T1cpN1aM0 (according to the tumor\u2013node\u2013metastasis classification system), estrogen receptor (ER)\u2013positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\u2013negative invasive lobular breast cancer of the left breast was diagnosed. She had been treated initially with lumpectomy, radiation, and adjuvant chemotherapy, as well as with tamoxifen for 5 years and letrozole for 2 years. Three years before the current admission, there was a locoregional recurrence of ER-positive breast cancer in her left axilla; a lymph-node biopsy was negative. Staging studies reportedly revealed mildly prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and several indeterminate hepatic and renal lesions. Biopsy of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes was reportedly negative. The patient declined recommended chemotherapeutic treatment options for recurrent breast cancer and instead opted for surveillance imaging. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and mammography of the breasts, which had been performed 6 months before the current admission, were reportedly unchanged from previous imaging. She had not palpated any new breast lumps on self-examination.\nThree years before the current admission, systemic sclerosis associated with antibodies against RNA polymerase III was diagnosed. Sclerosis was limited to the skin, and the patient had not received any specific treatment. Other medical history included Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, latent tuberculosis that had been diagnosed 30 years earlier and treated with isoniazid for 9 months, dyslipidemia, and osteoporosis. Medications included exemestane, goserelin, calcium, cholecalciferol, pantoprazole, and rosuvastatin. The patient took no over-the-counter remedies or supplements. She was allergic to trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, which had caused fever and hives. She drank alcohol rarely and did not use any other substances. She had smoked tobacco for 3 years but had quit 50 years before the current admission. The patient was married and lived with her husband in New England. She was retired from work in health care. Three of her sisters had had breast cancer in their seventh decades of life; there was no family history of hemolysis.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 162/98 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 17. The patient was alert and oriented. There was jaundice and scleral icterus. She had a well-healed lumpectomy scar on the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There was no cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Mild skin thickening was present on the hands and feet, with subtly reduced skin mobility of the forearms and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood level of creatinine was 2.87 mg per deciliter (254 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the blood urea nitrogen level was 62 mg per deciliter (22 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [3 to 9 mmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 3+ blood and 2+ protein, without bilirubin, urobilinogen, glucose, ketones, leukocyte esterase, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed 10 to 20 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2) and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10), and there were muddy-brown casts without dysmorphic red cells. The total protein:creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample was 6.41 (reference value, <0.15). A peripheral-blood smear was obtained.\nDr. Robert Ta: The peripheral-blood smear (Figure 1) showed anisopoikilocytosis, 10 to 15 schistocytes per high-power field, teardrop cells, nucleated red cells, reticulocytes, and mature and left-shifted myeloid cells.\nFIGURE 1\n\nPeripheral-Blood Specimens on Admission to This Hospital.\nDr. Porterfield: Additional imaging studies were obtained, and a diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Jessica L. Logeman (Medicine): A 55-year-old man was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of a mediastinal mass that was identified as part of an evaluation for waxing and waning fevers, night sweats, and fatigue.\nThe patient had been well until 3 months before admission to this hospital, when fatigue and a transient pruritic maculopapular rash on the forearm developed. During the next 6 weeks, the forearm rash resolved but fatigue persisted. The patient began to take naps during the daytime and was unable to put in full days at his job in construction work. He also began to have night sweats and fevers with temperatures of up to 37.8\u00b0C.\nTwenty-seven days before admission to this hospital, the patient found that he was unable to work because of fatigue, and he sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Blood tests for anaplasma and babesia nucleic acids were negative, but screening and confirmatory tests for Lyme disease IgM and IgG were positive. A diagnosis of Lyme disease was made, and treatment with doxycycline was initiated. Because gastrointestinal upset developed, doxycycline was discontinued and amoxicillin was prescribed for the remainder of the 14-day course.\nSixteen days before admission to this hospital, the patient began to have chest discomfort, which he described as a sensation of a \u201csoftball\u201d in his left lower chest. The chest discomfort limited his ability to breathe, and his primary care physician referred him to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, he reported increasing fatigue and malaise, night sweats, and fevers, along with diffuse arthralgias and myalgias, headache, photophobia with some visual flashes, dyspnea on exertion, edema, a pruritic erythematous rash on his chest, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and distention, and watery diarrhea that occurred three times per day.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 145/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 61 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.1. There was a faint diffuse erythematous macular rash on the anterior portion of the chest. The abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and lipase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram was normal. Intravenous normal saline and oral acetaminophen were administered, as was empirical treatment with intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, hydromorphone, and ondansetron.

Goiffon: Fifteen days before admission to this hospital, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a bilobed heterogeneous soft-tissue mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 2.8 cm, in the anterior mediastinum. There were multiple enlarged subcarinal and mediastinal lymph nodes (measuring up to 15 mm in short-axis diameter), multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (measuring up to 11 mm in short-axis diameter), mesenteric fat stranding, and trace ascites.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Logeman: Abdominal discomfort persisted; piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was discontinued and ceftriaxone was prescribed. Two days later, CT of the abdomen, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new pulmonary edema, new small bilateral pleural effusions, and an increased volume of ascites. The patient was transferred to a second hospital for further evaluation.\nPhysical examination was notable for mild abdominal tenderness and distention, as well as leg edema. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin and a urinalysis were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) (Figure 1D) revealed indeterminate low-level FDG uptake in the anterior mediastinal soft tissue, as well as in pleural effusions and mediastinal lymph nodes.\nDuring the next week, dyspnea and abdominal pain persisted. Edema increased, specifically in the abdomen, legs, and face; the weight increased to 93.0 kg. Intravenous ceftriaxone and metoclopramide and oral hydromorphone, ondansetron, and lactulose were administered. Additional laboratory tests were performed (Table 2).\nTABLE 2\n\nAdditional Laboratory Data.\nOn the eighth day at the second hospital, video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed. The mediastinum reportedly appeared inflamed. The patient underwent an evacuation of pleural fluid and a biopsy of mediastinal soft tissue and lymph nodes primarily in the subcarinal window (level VII). On pathological examination of the biopsy specimens, the mediastinal soft tissue showed fibroconnective and adipose tissue with fibrosis, mild inflammation and fat necrosis, prominent capillary proliferation, and congestion; the lymph nodes were reportedly \u201cmildly abnormal.\u201d Microbiologic evaluation of the biopsy specimens revealed occasional leukocytes but no acid-fast bacilli or fungal elements. On flow cytometry of the biopsy specimens, the mediastinal soft tissue did not show any abnormal cell populations; the lymph nodes contained polyclonal B-cell and heterogeneous T-cell populations, without immunophenotypic evidence of lymphoma. Bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures of the biopsy specimens were negative. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid revealed reactive mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes but no malignant cells.\nAfter the procedure, the creatinine level increased to 2.93 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.50 to 1.30). Examination of urinary sediment revealed hyaline and granular casts. Intravenous furosemide was administered. On the 15th day at the second hospital, the patient was transferred to this hospital.\nOn arrival, the patient reported persistent fatigue, mild dyspnea, abdominal distention, edema, and anorexia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and the chest rash had resolved. Fevers and night sweats had occurred in a waxing and waning pattern during the previous weeks. He reported intermittent photophobia and headache, without neck stiffness or phonophobia, and had no other neurologic symptoms.\nThe patient had no history of illness and had not received routine medical care as an adult. He took ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed and had no known allergies to medications. He had been exposed to dust through his job in construction work. He lived with his wife, child, and pet dog and cat in a coastal wooded community in New England. He frequently spent time outdoors, either working or playing golf, and had received multiple tick bites. He had traveled to the Mediterranean and Oceania regions in previous years and, more recently, to the southwestern United States. The patient had never used tobacco or illicit drugs and drank beer rarely. His father had had prostate cancer and colon cancer.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 148/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 91.7 kg. Neurologic examination was normal, and there was no nuchal rigidity. There were inspiratory crackles in the left lung. The abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Mild fluctuance was noted on the right side of the chest, at the site of the surgical incision. There was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, submandibular, submental, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There was 2+ pitting edema in the legs.\nBlood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, folate, globulin, haptoglobin, and vitamin B12 were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed cloudy yellow urine with 2+ protein and 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2). An electrocardiogram was normal.\nDr. Goiffon: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1E), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an anterior mediastinal mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 1.9 cm, which was slightly smaller than it had been on the previous chest CT. There were enlarged perivascular, paratracheal, subcarinal, and aortopulmonary mediastinal lymph nodes (measuring up to 12 mm in short-axis diameter) with heterogeneous enhancement. Increased pulmonary edema, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, moderate-volume ascites, mild splenomegaly, and multiple subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes were detected.\nDr. Logeman: On the third hospital day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed no abnormalities. On the fourth day, a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Intravenous furosemide and oral acetaminophen were administered. Lumbar puncture was performed, and 26 ml of colorless fluid was removed; opening pressure was not measured. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. On the fifth day, renal ultrasonography revealed kidneys of normal size with normal parenchyma and no hydronephrosis. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed; results of ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table S1.\nDr. Goiffon: On the 13th day, MRI of the chest was started but could not be completed because the patient had respiratory distress when placed in the prone position. Sequences that were obtained before termination of the study (Figure 1F) showed an anterior mediastinal soft-tissue mass with hypointensity on steady-state gradient echo imaging; the mass was smaller than it had been on chest CT performed before transfer to this hospital. In addition, there were enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, large bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and a hematoma at the site of the surgical incision.\nDr. Logeman: Additional laboratory tests were performed (Table 2). A diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Erin E. Mauney (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea.\nThe patient had been well until 5 weeks before this admission, when diarrhea and intermittent, diffuse, crampy abdominal pain developed. During the subsequent week, the diarrhea occurred more frequently, and the abdominal pain worsened in severity, such that it sometimes awoke the patient from sleep. Four weeks before this admission, the diarrhea began to contain dark-red blood. The patient\u2019s mother took her to the primary care clinic of another hospital.\nIn the primary care clinic, the weight was 98.7 kg; the physical examination was otherwise normal. The hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Stool cultures for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were negative, as were antigen tests for giardia, cryptosporidium, and Clostridioides difficile toxin. Empirical treatment with ciprofloxacin was started.\nDuring the next 3 weeks, the patient completed the course of ciprofloxacin as instructed, but the abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea continued. On the day of this admission, diarrhea occurred at least four times. The patient\u2019s parents called the primary care clinic and were instructed to bring her to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported fatigue, malaise, weight loss, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea and vomiting when she ate food. She also had headache and mild, diffuse joint and muscle pain. She had had no fever or sick contacts.\nThe patient had obesity, anxiety, and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Medications included fluoxetine and dextroamphetamine\u2013amphetamine; there were no known drug allergies. Menarche had occurred when she was 11 years of age, and her last menstrual period had been 2 months earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke tobacco. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her mother, father, and sister, as well as her pet dog, cat, and lizard. She attended a technical high school with an emphasis on agriculture, and she had frequent interactions with marine and farm animals through school. Her family history included colorectal cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in her maternal grandfather, diverticulosis in her maternal grandmother and mother, psoriasis in her maternal grandmother and uncle, and celiac disease in her paternal cousin. Her father had hyperlipidemia, and her mother had had one miscarriage, which had occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 94/68 mm Hg. The weight was 89.8 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.7. The patient appeared pale, tired, and uncomfortable because of pain. The mucous membranes were dry. The abdomen was nondistended, and there was mild tenderness in both lower quadrants. There was no ulceration or rash.\nThe white-cell count was 10,690 per microliter (reference range in children 12 to 17 years of age, 4500 to 10,700), the platelet count 188,000 per microliter, and the hemoglobin level 9.8 g per deciliter. The blood level of C-reactive protein was 248.0 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 71 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, and ondansetron were administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Admission, Hospital Day 5\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201316.0, 9.8, 8.8\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 31.4, 27.6\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 188,000, 67,000\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201313,000, 10,690, 13,490\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l)\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20138100, 9000, 10,020\nLymphocytes, 1200\u20135200, 1120, 2290\nMonocytes, 200\u20131400, 360, 780\nEosinophils, 0\u20131000, 100, 140\nBasophils, 0\u2013400, 30, 20\n\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 16.6, 17.3\nProthrombin-time international normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.4, 1.4\nActivated partial-thromboplastin time (sec), 22.0\u201336.0, 47.0, 50.0\nD-dimer (ng/ml), 0\u2013500, \u2014, >10,000\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201320, 71, \u2014\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), 0.0\u20138.0, 248.0, 66.9\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/liter), 110\u2013210, \u2014, 299\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201333, 52, 5766\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201332, 39, 1429\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 50\u2013117, 207, 189\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 0.3, 0.9\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 2.4, 2.9\nGlobulin (g/dl), 1.9\u20134.1, 4.3, 1.7\n\nOn hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level was 8.2 g per deciliter, and one unit of packed red cells was transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed.\nDr. Maureen M. Leonard: On EGD, two cratered esophageal ulcers were located 30 cm from the incisors (Figure 1A). The proximal, middle, and distal portions of the esophagus were normal. Diffuse mild inflammation \u2014 characterized by erythema and friability \u2014 was found in the cardia, gastric fundus, and gastric antrum (Figure 1B). The duodenum appeared normal. Biopsy specimens were obtained throughout the procedure for histologic evaluation.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImages Obtained during Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and Colonoscopy.\nWhen the patient was being positioned on the procedure table for the colonoscopy, a large volume of bright-red blood was noted to be draining from the rectum. Perianal and digital rectal examinations did not reveal a source of bleeding. Emergency radiography of the abdomen did not reveal free air, and the colonoscopy was started. On colonoscopy, the rectum and proximal sigmoid colon appeared normal (Figure 1C). However, as the colonoscope was advanced farther into the sigmoid colon, multiple nonobstructing, large, friable, dark-violet lesions were identified and biopsied (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F). Because of narrowing and severe friability, the area was not traversed with the endoscope, and the procedure was aborted.\nDr. Mauney: The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of this hospital. During the subsequent 2 days, an additional two units of packed red cells were transfused. Treatment with pantoprazole was started.\nDr. Sjirk J. Westra: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and chest was performed (Figure 2A through 2D). There was irregular thickening of the large bowel wall and adjacent fat stranding, with sparing of the distal sigmoid colon and rectum. The kidneys had multifocal patchy areas of hypoattenuation.\nFIGURE 2\n\nInitial Imaging Studies.\nDr. Mauney: On hospital day 5, tachycardia and tachypnea developed. The hemoglobin level was 8.8 g per deciliter, and the platelet count was 67,000 per microliter. The prothrombin time was 17.3 seconds (reference range, 11.5 to 14.5), the prothrombin-time international normalized ratio 1.4 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), the activated partial-thromboplastin time 50.0 seconds (reference range, 22.0 to 36.0), and the blood d-dimer level greater than 10,000 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Westra: Thoracic CT angiography revealed a central filling defect in the distal right pulmonary artery, a finding consistent with pulmonary embolism (Figure 2E). There was also a large right pleural effusion.\nDr. Mauney: A diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Beatriz Rizkallah Alves (Neurology): A 71-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital for neurosurgical evaluation because of confusion, aphasia, and a mass lesion in the brain.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current presentation, when headache and fatigue developed. The next day, she was typing on a computer at her workplace when she suddenly noticed that her typed words were incoherent. The episode of confusion and language production difficulties resolved after a few minutes. Confusion recurred in the evening while the patient was at dinner with her husband, and she sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Examination was reportedly normal.\nDr. Jeremy N. Ford: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, and CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed a large area of attenuation in the left posterior superior frontal lobe.\nDr. Alves: The patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nDr. Ford: On hospital day 2, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left frontal lobe with vasogenic edema and mass effect. A diagnosis of cancer with metastases to the brain was considered, and additional imaging studies were obtained. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly showed a pulmonary nodule that measured 0.2 cm in diameter and a nodule in the right breast that measured 1.3 cm in diameter. The appearance of the breast nodule was unchanged from that observed on imaging performed 8 years before the current presentation, except for the presence of a new punctate calcification along the anterior margin.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head Obtained on Hospital Day 2.\nOn hospital day 3, expressive aphasia developed. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly showed increased edema and mass effect that corresponded to the abnormality in the left frontal lobe.\nDr. Alves: Treatment with dexamethasone and levetiracetam was started. The patient received one dose of each medication before she was transferred to the neurosurgical unit of this hospital for evaluation and possible brain biopsy.\nThe patient had a history of myasthenia gravis, vitamin B12 deficiency, and hypertension. Surgical history included supracervical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine fibroids (performed 31 years before the current presentation), transsternal thymectomy and wedge resection of the right upper lobe for a cortical thymoma (22 years before the current presentation), and sigmoid colectomy for recurrent diverticulitis (7 years before the current presentation). Ocular-predominant myasthenia gravis was diagnosed 18 years before the current presentation and 4 years after thymectomy. Myasthenia gravis had been treated for 11 years with cyclosporine and pyridostigmine. Seven years before the current presentation, a flare of myasthenia gravis was complicated by respiratory failure, for which the patient received bilevel positive airway pressure and underwent plasmapheresis. After that hospitalization, cyclosporine therapy was replaced by mycophenolate mofetil, which she had been taking daily for the past 7 years.\nOther medications included cholecalciferol, latanoprost ophthalmic drops, hydrochlorothiazide, polysaccharide\u2013iron complex capsules, and monthly intramuscular vitamin B12 injections. Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate had previously caused rash. The patient lived in the northeastern United States, was married, and worked in an office. She had recently traveled to California for a wedding, and she reported no exposures to animals or fresh water. She had not had any recent dental procedures. She had no history of tobacco use or injection drug use. She rarely consumed alcoholic beverages. Her mother had systemic lupus erythematosus, and her father had lung cancer. A sister had rheumatoid arthritis.\nOn examination, the oral temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 150/80 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Severe expressive aphasia was observed, and she followed commands intermittently. Orientation could not be accurately assessed. She had disconjugate gaze at rest. Motor strength was 5/5 in the left arm and left leg and 4/5 in the right arm and right leg. The blood level of glucose was normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of phosphorus was 2.2 mg per deciliter (reference range, 2.6 to 4.5). The complete blood count was normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation.\nElectroencephalography showed intermittent irregular delta slowing focally over the left frontal region but no epileptiform abnormalities. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed ill-defined parenchymal hypoattenuation involving the left superior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and left centrum semiovale with associated sulcal effacement. Treatment with dexamethasone, hydrochlorothiazide, mycophenolate mofetil, and pyridostigmine was stopped, as was treatment with cholecalciferol, latanoprost drops, polysaccharide\u2013iron complex, and vitamin B12. Treatment with levetiracetam was continued, and empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin was started.\nDr. Gavin P. Dunn: A left frontal craniotomy with open brain biopsy was planned to allow for sufficient lesional tissue to be obtained and to enable further debulking to be performed, pending intraoperative findings and the results of pathological assessment. A small craniotomy centered at the coronal suture directly over the target lesion was performed. The lesion appeared gray, and tissue that appeared abnormal was sampled in several locations of the lesion. Direct microscopic visualization of the specimens identified areas that did not appear to be completely distinct from normal tissue, and thus, further debulking was not indicated. No purulence was noted.\nDr. Christopher W. Mount: Intraoperative examination of a frozen section (Figure 2) revealed a cellular infiltrate consisting of atypical cells in a focal perivascular arrangement. No evidence of pathologically significant acute inflammation was present in the tissue. At this time, these features suggested the presence of a malignant infiltrate. Additional specimens were submitted to the pathology department for formalin fixation and interpretation.\nFIGURE 2\n\nFrozen Section of Brain Tissue.\nDr. Alves: A diagnosis of lymphoma was considered, and treatment with dexamethasone administered intravenously every 6 hours was started. On postoperative day 1, new facial droop on the right side developed, along with weakness with cervical flexion and monoplegia of the right arm.\nDr. Ford: Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 3), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed postsurgical changes in the left frontal lobe and susceptibility artifact at the biopsy site that was consistent with blood products. There was enlargement of the expansile lesion in the left frontal lobe that corresponded to an area of hyperintensity on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging.\nFIGURE 3\n\nMRI of the Head Obtained on Postoperative Day 1.\nDr. Alves: A diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Will Pohlman (Medicine): An 82-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of difficulty walking, falls, and cognitive decline.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health, living independently with her husband and participating in a walking club, until 8 months before the current presentation, when generalized weakness developed. She began to walk more slowly and was no longer active with her walking club; she felt limited by pain in her feet.\nFive months before the current presentation, the patient began to have difficulty with climbing stairs and with rising from a seated position. Four months before the current presentation, she began to have falls at home.\nThree months before the current presentation, the patient fell and her husband was not able to lift her up from the floor. Emergency medical services were called, and she was admitted to another hospital for evaluation. During that hospitalization, a urinary tract infection and hyponatremia were diagnosed. The urinary tract infection was treated with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. The hyponatremia was attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone and was treated with fluid restriction and salt tablets. The use of a walker was recommended, and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. After 3 weeks in the rehabilitation facility, she was discharged home, but she fell again at home and subsequently returned to the other hospital for evaluation. She was readmitted to the other hospital and again discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\nEight weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from the rehabilitation facility, and she and her husband moved to an assisted-living facility. Fatigue developed, along with loss of appetite and a reduced intake of food. The patient began to need one-person assistance to walk. She also noticed that she had been having difficulty with math associated with the family finances, which she had always done with ease. Her family noticed that she had been having trouble carrying on a conversation and that she seemed less attentive than usual.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, the patient had another fall and was admitted to a second hospital, where she was found to have hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head reportedly showed moderate chronic small-vessel ischemic changes and ventriculomegaly. Increased food intake was encouraged, and outpatient evaluation in the neurology clinic affiliated with the second hospital was arranged. Discharge to a rehabilitation facility was recommended, but after discussions between the patient and her family, the patient returned to the assisted-living facility.\nAfter discharge from the hospital, the patient had a progressive loss of independence. She noted worsening generalized weakness and low back pain, and she needed two-person assistance to walk. Her family brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported urinary incontinence, which she attributed to not having enough time to get to the toilet because of her physical limitations with movement; she had no dysuria or urinary urgency. There was no fecal incontinence.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. Surgical history included hemiarthroplasty of the right shoulder and arthroplasty of both knees. She had chronic pain in the shoulders, knees, wrists, and hands, which had been attributed to osteoarthritis; the knee and shoulder pain had decreased after the surgeries but then returned during the year before the current presentation. Medications included atorvastatin, calcium citrate, levothyroxine, lisinopril, and tramadol. She had no known drug allergies. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. In addition to her husband, her support network included four children who lived near the assisted-living facility. She was retired and had previously worked in finance. Her mother had had diabetes, and her father had had thyroid cancer; there was no known family history of dementia or neurodegenerative disorders.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/54 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. She appeared tired but was oriented to person and place. Pitting edema was present in the legs to the level of the mid-shins. A detailed strength examination was limited because of pain, with minimal movement of the shoulders, wrists, fingers, ankles, and knees. The patient could wiggle her toes but had weak plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of both feet. She could easily wiggle her fingers and lift her arms against gravity at the elbows. Light touch of the dorsum of the right hand caused pain, as did light touch of the right knee and the soles of both feet. Recognition of sensation to light touch and to vibration were normal. Cerebellar testing, gait testing, and reflex testing were limited by severe pain with movement and touch. The patient had symmetric erythema, swelling, and tenderness of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. She had limited range of motion in the wrists and elbows, along with symmetric tenderness in the subtalar joints and swelling and pain with squeezing of the metatarsophalangeal joints.\nThe blood levels of alcohol, ammonia, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and urine toxicology screening; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 3+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative) and the presence of nitrates (reference value, negative), and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). Urine was obtained for culture, and intravenous ceftriaxone was administered. Imaging studies were obtained.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Admission\n\nBlood:\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201316.0, 9.2\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 28.7\nMean corpuscular volume (fl), 80\u2013100, 73\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 7470\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 5760\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 650\nMonocytes, 200\u20131200, 840\nEosinophils, 0\u2013900, 160\nBasophils, 0\u2013300, 10\nImmature granulocytes, 0\u2013100, 50\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 481,000\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201329, 28\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), <8.0, 143.8\n\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 124\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 4.3\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 90\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 23\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 14\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.56\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 118\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 8.4\nMagnesium (mg/dl), 1.7\u20132.4, 1.7\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.0\u20138.3, 5.1\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 2.6\nOsmolality (mOsm/kg of water), 280\u2013296, 255\n\nUrine:\nSodium (mmol/liter), \u2014, 52\nOsmolality (mOsm/kg of water), 150\u20131150, 484\n\nDr. Ambrose J. Huang: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed moderate ventriculomegaly that was out of proportion to the enlargement of the cerebral sulci (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Head.\nDr. Pohlman: A high-volume lumbar puncture with gait evaluation before and after the procedure was not possible, given the patient\u2019s inability to walk unassisted. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus was generally thought to be unlikely to explain her presentation. Altered mental status was attributed to delirium in the context of tramadol use and urinary tract infection. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nOn hospital day 2, the urine culture grew Citrobacter farmeri; treatment with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was started. MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was terminated early because of the patient\u2019s pain, and the images that were obtained were degraded by motion artifacts. However, no marked signal abnormality in the spinal cord or high-grade spinal or foraminal stenosis was observed. Additional laboratory studies were obtained. Tests for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus antibodies, and hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative. The blood levels of glycated hemoglobin and cobalamin were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation; blood samples were obtained for measurement of copper and vitamin B6 levels. Treatment with gabapentin was started for neuropathic pain. On hospital day 3, pain had not decreased, and the dose of gabapentin was increased.\nDr. Bart K. Chwalisz: On hospital day 4, electromyography and nerve conduction studies were performed. The amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was normal with stimulation of the right tibial nerve but was reduced with stimulation of the left tibial nerve and both peroneal nerves; in addition, the CMAP amplitude of the left ulnar nerve was mildly reduced, and that of the left median nerve was normal. The sensory-nerve action potential of the left radial nerve was normal, but the sensory-nerve action potential of the left sural nerve could not be obtained. The conduction velocities and distal latencies were normal. There was no abnormal spontaneous activity in any muscle examined. The motor-unit action potentials and motor-unit recruitment with voluntary activation were normal throughout.\nDr. Pohlman: The results of the additional blood tests became available. The copper level was normal, and the vitamin B6 level was less than 2 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50). Treatment with vitamin B6 supplementation was started.\nAdditional diagnostic tests were performed.",

Bromberg: A 76-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain, anorexia, weight loss, memory impairment, and suicidal ideation.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 months before this admission, when she began having epigastric pain and anorexia associated with new constipation. Findings on upper and lower endoscopy were reportedly normal, as were the results of serologic testing for celiac disease.\nFifteen days before this admission, the abdominal pain worsened. Ten days before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital because of diffuse abdominal pain associated with nausea and poor oral intake. On examination, the patient appeared pale. The abdomen was soft and nontender. The patient was alert and oriented to time, place, and person but had difficulty with word finding.

There was evidence of a previous cholecystectomy, the common bile duct measured 7 mm in diameter (reference range, <10 mm after cholecystectomy), and there was mild anasarca with diffuse mesenteric edema. On magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (Figure 1C and 1D), the common bile duct again measured 7 mm in diameter; findings were otherwise normal.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Pelvis, Other Hospital.\nDr. Bromberg: After admission to the other hospital, 1 unit of packed red cells was transfused, and the hemoglobin level remained stable thereafter. On the third hospital day, the patient could eat small amounts of food. On further questioning, the patient expressed suicidal ideation and reported a history of prolonged domestic abuse; she was evaluated by the psychiatry service. A diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder was made, and lorazepam was administered. The suicidal ideation resolved, but she was noted to need substantial assistance with self-care. While plans were being made for the patient\u2019s discharge to an assisted-living facility, the constipation worsened, and her oral intake decreased. On the seventh hospital day, vomiting developed, and the laboratory evaluation was notable for hyponatremia, with a blood sodium level of 120 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). A nasogastric tube was placed, and 3% hypertonic saline was administered intravenously. On the eighth day at the other hospital, additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Chung: Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1E and 1F), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple dilated, fluid-filled loops of small bowel that measured up to 4 cm in diameter and the presence of air\u2013fluid levels and an abrupt transition point in the right lower quadrant.\nDr. Bromberg: Urine specimens had been sent for measurement of urinary porphyrin levels at the time of admission to the other hospital; the resulting levels were elevated (Table 1), and the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn admission to this hospital, the patient reported persistent abdominal pain, constipation, and anorexia. The vomiting had resolved after insertion of the nasogastric tube. She reported weight loss of 18 kg over the course of the previous 4 months while she was following a limited diet. In an effort to improve the patient\u2019s overall health, the patient\u2019s daughter had provided her with supplements and recommended a ketogenic diet consisting of protein and cooked vegetables. The patient also reported that she had been having difficulty with memory for 2 months before this admission.\nThe patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glaucoma. Her surgical history included remote cholecystectomy and hysterectomy. Medications included pantoprazole, ondansetron, and calcium carbonate in combination with cholecalciferol. The patient was allergic to ampicillin, penicillin, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, tetracycline, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, and nortriptyline \u2014 all with unknown reactions. She lived with her sister in suburban New England and reported that she was recently separated from her husband owing to long-standing domestic abuse. The patient had two children. She did not have contact with her son, and her daughter lived in India but visited regularly. Her mother had died from breast cancer. Her father and son both had bipolar affective disorder. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.5. The patient appeared cachectic. There was a nasogastric tube in place. The conjunctivae were pale. The abdomen was soft and diffusely tender, without guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness. There was no rash. The patient was alert but inconsistently oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was tangential, and she was unable to recite days of the week backward. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe hemoglobin level was 9.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A peripheral-blood smear showed normochromic red cells with occasional burr cells and no schistocytes. Reticulocytes, basophilic stippling, and rare nucleated red cells were present; there were no blasts, and the white cells were morphologically normal.\nDr. Chung: Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant revealed mildly increased echogenicity and mild coarsening of the liver parenchyma (Figure 2). The common bile duct measured 5 mm in diameter.\nFIGURE 2\n\nAdditional Imaging Studies of the Abdomen, This Hospital.\nDr. Bromberg: Intravenous fluids and hemin were administered. On the third hospital day, the volume of output from the nasogastric tube remained elevated. The patient underwent surgical exploration for possible small-bowel obstruction. Dilated loops of small bowel with a transition point near the terminal ileum were observed; there was a loop of small bowel tethered underneath an adhesion band around which the cecum had volvulized. The adhesion was lysed, and the loop of small bowel released. There was no mass or stricture.\nA diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Vivian De Oliveira Rodrigues Gama (Medicine): A 31-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of perianal and penile ulcers, rectal pain, and vesiculopustular rash.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 days before this admission, when he noticed several itchy white \u201cbumps\u201d around the anus that subsequently evolved into ulcerative lesions. The next day, he sought evaluation at a primary care clinic of another hospital. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia were performed. An injection of penicillin G benzathine was administered, and treatment with valacyclovir was started.\nDuring the next 5 days, the perianal ulcers did not abate, and the patient stopped taking valacyclovir. Painful proctitis with rectal bleeding and malodorous, mucopurulent discharge developed, along with fever, chills, drenching sweats, and new tender swelling in the groin. Three days before this admission, a new painless ulcer appeared on the penis that was similar in appearance to the perianal ulcers. Two days before this admission, new scattered vesicular lesions appeared on the arms and legs, and the patient presented to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital for evaluation.\nAdditional history was obtained from the patient. Fourteen years before this evaluation, sore throat and upper body rash developed; he received a diagnosis of secondary syphilis and was treated with penicillin G benzathine. He also had a history of recurrent oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, for which he was treated intermittently with valacyclovir. He took daily oral emtricitabine and tenofovir for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). There were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived in a suburban area of Massachusetts with two roommates and a cat. Two weeks before this evaluation, he had traveled to an urban area of southeastern Canada. During this trip, he had had sex with male partners without the use of barrier protection. There was no other recent travel. The patient did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he drank alcohol rarely.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 130/86 mm Hg, the pulse 75 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.9. There were six tender perianal ulcers, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, with raised, firm margins. There was also one ulcer on the dorsum of the penile shaft, measuring 7 mm in diameter, with raised borders (Figure 1). Painful bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy was present. The perianal skin was weeping, and there was proctitis with severe tenderness that precluded digital rectal examination. In addition, there were approximately 12 papulovesicular lesions scattered across the chest, back, arms, and legs. The lesions measured 2 mm in diameter, were filled with clear fluid, and had surrounding erythema (Figure 2A and 2B).\nFIGURE 1\n\nPhotographs of Perianal and Penile Ulcers from 2 Days before Admission.\nFIGURE 2\n\nPhotographs of the Rash.\nBlood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. A blood test for treponemal antibodies was positive; a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was reactive at a dilution of 1:1. A blood test for HIV was nonreactive, and tests of urine and rectal specimens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acids were negative. A test of a specimen obtained from a perianal ulcer for HSV nucleic acids was performed, and a blood sample was obtained for bacterial culture. An injection of ceftriaxone was administered, and treatment with valacyclovir and doxycycline was started.\nDuring the next 2 days, the ulcers did not abate and the rectal pain worsened, such that the patient was not able to sit, sleep, or have bowel movements. Additional skin lesions appeared. The patient returned to the infectious disease clinic for evaluation. Anoscopy revealed intense rectal and anal inflammation with shallow ulcerations and purulent exudate, findings consistent with proctitis (Figure 3). The patient was admitted to this hospital.\nFIGURE 3\n\nPhotograph from Anoscopic Examination.\nOn examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable because of rectal pain. Skin lesions that had become pustular with an erythematous base were scattered across the scalp, chest, back, legs, and arms, including one on the palm (Figure 2C). There were no lesions in the mouth. Multiple tender, enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, measuring more than 1 cm in diameter, were present. The perianal and penile ulcers were tender and had heaped margins around a central dry base. The complete blood count and the white-cell differential count were normal. Swabs from a perianal ulcer and a chest skin lesion were obtained for bacterial culture.\nTreatment with intravenous acyclovir was started, and doxycycline was continued; stool softeners and hydromorphone were administered. A blood test for HIV type 1 RNA was performed.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Richard A. Newcomb: A 49-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\nFourteen months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated at another hospital because of pain in the right upper quadrant that had begun 4 days earlier and was associated with nausea and vomiting. Abdominal imaging revealed evidence of acute cholecystitis. Initial laboratory test results showed peripheral blasts that were suggestive of acute leukemia. The patient was transferred to a second hospital for additional evaluation. At the second hospital, abdominal imaging confirmed acute cholecystitis, and a calculus was found lodged in the neck of the gallbladder. The white-cell count was 4200 per microliter (reference range, 4200 to 9900), of which 40% were blasts. A peripheral-blood smear was notable for circulating blasts with Auer rods. The hemoglobin level was 11.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.0 to 17.4), and the platelet count was 22,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000). A bone marrow biopsy was performed, followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nDr. Andrew M. Crabbe: The bone marrow biopsy performed at the second hospital was inadequate owing to the small size of the specimen; however, intact bone marrow particles showed a cellularity of 95 to 100%. A 300-cell differential count on combined touch-imprint and aspirate smears showed 39% blasts, 3% promyelocytes, 19% neutrophils and precursors, 5% erythroid precursors, 30% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, and less than 1% basophils. The blasts were medium in size, with irregular nuclear contours, moderately clumped chromatin, occasional prominent small nucleoli, and scant granular cytoplasm. Auer rods were identified. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood identified myeloid blasts that were negative for CD34 and HLA-DR and positive for CD117, CD33, CD13, and myeloperoxidase. Cytogenetic analysis of the peripheral blood with the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a normal karyotype (46,XY) and no evidence of a t(15;17) chromosomal translocation. Molecular testing of the peripheral blood by means of dedicated polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing and next-generation sequencing identified mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, and NRAS and did not identify mutations in FLT3, IDH1, or IDH2. The overall findings of this testing were consistent with the World Health Organization classification of AML with mutated NPM1.\nDr. Newcomb: Induction chemotherapy with 7 days of cytarabine and 3 days of daunorubicin was administered. On day 34 after the initiation of chemotherapy, the absolute neutrophil count was 2.2 per microliter (reference range, 1.5 to 7.5), and the platelet count was 536,000 per microliter. A bone marrow biopsy performed on day 37 after initiation of chemotherapy revealed hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. There was no morphologic or phenotypic evidence of persistent or relapsed AML. A 300-cell sample of the bone marrow aspirate contained less than 1% blasts. Consolidation chemotherapy with four cycles of high-dose cytarabine was completed 8 months before the current presentation.\nDr. Crabbe: A bone marrow biopsy performed after the final cycle of chemotherapy revealed normocellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis; there was no morphologic or phenotypic evidence of AML. Next-generation sequencing of the bone marrow biopsy specimen revealed no pathogenic mutations.\nDr. Newcomb: The patient remained well for 7 months. One month before the current presentation, mild leukopenia developed, and more frequent laboratory monitoring was instituted. One week before the current presentation, the white-cell count was 2600 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 10,000), of which 13% were peripheral blasts. The patient was referred to this hospital for evaluation.\nOn presentation to this hospital, the patient reported a 3-week history of progressive fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, exercise intolerance, widespread muscle aches, and night sweats. He noted that similar symptoms had preceded his initial diagnosis.\nMedical history included obesity and hypertension. The patient was not taking medications on a regular basis. He was allergic to chlorhexidine, which caused rash. He lived in rural New England with his wife and four children. He worked as a software engineer. He did not smoke, and he drank alcohol rarely. His mother had coronary artery disease, and a sister had had a stroke. He had three other siblings who were healthy. There was no family history of leukemia or other hematologic disorders.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 35.7\u00b0C. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 43. No lymphadenopathy, rashes, or skin lesions were present. The remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 5830 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), of which 39.6% were blasts.

Bilateral, frontal, pulsatile headache developed suddenly and reached maximal intensity within seconds. The patient rated the pain at 10 (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain) and noted that it was the worst headache pain that she had ever had. The pain was so severe that she could not complete her sentence. She sat down, feeling as though she might faint because of the severity of the pain. She repeatedly told her husband, \u201cSomething is really wrong.\u201d Nausea developed without emesis. When the symptoms did not abate after 30 minutes, emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing headache and nausea. Medical history included hypertension and cervical disk disease with chronic neck pain. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide and oral conjugated estrogens, which the patient took every 3 days for symptoms of menopause. She had no known allergies. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. She lived with her husband and worked as an administrative assistant. Her mother had diabetes. There was no family history of venous thromboembolism.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 157/77 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The neck was supple. She was oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. The visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The visualized portions of the retina were normal in both eyes with normal-appearing optic disks. Tests of motor strength and sensation showed normal results, as did tests of reflexes and cerebellar function. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count with differential count and the results of tests of kidney function and coagulation. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Javier M. Romero: Two hours after the onset of headache, computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1), revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left superior parietal lobule and paramedian parietal sulci.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT Scan of the Head, Obtained during the Initial Presentation.\nDr. DiCarlo: Treatment with intravenous morphine and promethazine was administered. Nausea resolved, and the headache pain abated. Four hours after the onset of headache, the blood pressure was 136/45 mm Hg. Additional laboratory studies were obtained. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 8 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), the blood level of C-reactive protein 2.7 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the blood level of troponin T 0.36 ng per milliliter (reference value, <0.03). Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block and diffuse submillimeter ST-segment depressions.\nAdditional testing was performed, and a diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Andrew F. Cohen (Pediatrics): A 10-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of vomiting, weight loss, and hypercalcemia.\nThe patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when projectile vomiting began to occur once every few days, typically after eating solid foods. The vomiting did not seem to bother the patient, and he immediately returned to his normal activity after each episode. During the subsequent 12 days, the vomiting became more frequent, occurring daily, and had begun to occur after drinking liquids as well.\nTwo days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the pediatric primary care clinic of this hospital. On examination, the weight was 7.36 kg (0.4th percentile for his age) (Figure 1). The patient appeared alert, attentive, and comfortable but thin. The abdomen was soft, without distention or tenderness, and there was no evidence of organomegaly or masses on palpation. The skin was diffusely dry with excoriations. Treatment with omeprazole was started.\nFIGURE 1\n\nGrowth Curves.\nOver the course of the next 2 days, the patient lost interest in eating solid food and preferred milk and water. He gagged at the sight of food. The frequency of the vomiting had increased, occurring after the patient ate or drank anything.\nOn the day of this admission, the patient refused to take any food by mouth. His parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival, his parents reported that in the previous 2 weeks, he had had normal activity, wet diapers, and daily soft stools. They also noted that he always seemed thirsty, and when given liquid, he would drink a lot. At times, he would even suck the water out of the washcloths that were used to bathe him.\nThe patient had been born after induction of labor at 38 weeks\u2019 gestation owing to maternal gestational hypertension. He had received routine newborn care and met normal developmental milestones. He maintained normal growth for his age until an evaluation at 9 months of age, when the weight was 7.44 kg (1.6th percentile), and the body length was 68.2 cm (6.5th percentile) (Figure 1). At a routine evaluation when he was 6 months of age, the weight was 7.39 kg (27.1st percentile), and the length was 66.7 cm (43.1st percentile). The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and eczema. Medications included omeprazole; he was not receiving any vitamins or supplements. He had no known drug allergies, and immunizations were up to date.\nThe patient lived with his mother and father in a suburban area of New England. His father had GERD and melanoma, and cardiomyopathy had led to heart transplantation 9 years earlier. His mother was well. The patient\u2019s paternal grandmother had the Lynch syndrome and hyperparathyroidism. His maternal grandmother had diabetes and coronary artery disease, his maternal grandfather had hypertension and eczema, and his maternal uncle had the DiGeorge syndrome.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 102/78 mm Hg, the pulse 140 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute.

Li (Medicine): A 47-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of confusion and acute kidney failure.\nThe patient had been well until 6 days before the current admission, when fatigue and myalgias developed. During the subsequent 2 days, he continued to report to his job at a restaurant. Four days before this admission, the patient\u2019s coworkers noticed that he was mildly confused. On the day of this admission, the confusion markedly increased, and new word-finding difficulties and garbled speech developed. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation in the emergency department, the patient was not able to participate fully in the interview or a review of systems because of confusion, but he described feeling hot and short of breath. He had not mentioned any recent cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or headache to his family or coworkers. He had no known recent falls, trauma, travel, or sick contacts.\nAdditional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family. He had no known medical problems or drug allergies. He used no prescription medications but took ginseng extract and burdock root supplements. He lived in an urban area of New England with a friend and no pets in a former factory that had been converted into apartments. The patient smoked marijuana occasionally and had smoked cigarettes as a teenager. He drank alcohol infrequently and did not use illicit drugs. His sister had Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, nemaline myopathy, cardiomyopathy, Fanconi\u2019s anemia, and renal tubular acidosis. His parents were healthy.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 35.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 142/78 mm Hg, the pulse 114 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient appeared anxious. He was alert and oriented; however, when he was asked a question, he often needed clarification and was slow to answer. He could not recite the days of the week backward and had difficulty following complex commands. His face was symmetric, and no dysarthria was noted. Cranial-nerve function, muscle tone and strength, sensation, proprioception, deep-tendon reflexes, and gait were normal. He did not have photophobia. The mucous membranes were moist, and the neck was supple. There was no jugular venous distention. The heart sounds were normal, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was nontender, and there was no hepatosplenomegaly. He had no leg swelling or rash.\nThe patient had a white-cell count of 13,270 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000). The blood urea nitrogen level was 117 mg per deciliter (41.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), the creatinine level 13.0 mg per deciliter (1149 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the creatine kinase level 28,581 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). He had hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis, as well as elevated blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

On the morning of admission, he noted an abrupt onset of shortness of breath at rest and dyspnea on exertion. There was also substernal chest pain on the left side that worsened with deep breaths and when he lay down. The patient\u2019s son called emergency medical services, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the patient described ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath. The son reported that the patient had fallen at home 2 days before admission, but the patient did not remember falling and the son was not able to provide details about the nature or circumstances of the fall. The patient reported no pain in his abdomen, arms, legs, or groin and no headache.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension. During a previous evaluation for cough, he was reportedly told that he had a lung disease that had \u201ccaused the lung tissue to harden.\u201d Before the onset of his most recent symptoms, he had walked outside on a daily basis without limitation from shortness of breath. He took an unknown medication for hypertension. The patient did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. He lived in an apartment with his wife.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 157/95 mm Hg, the pulse 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The respiratory rate decreased to 28 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation improved to 96% with the administration of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22.8. Retractions were noted in the supraclavicular areas.

    "user_input": "Dr. Zachary A. Sporn (Medicine): A 38-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of dyspnea, chest discomfort, and nodules on chest imaging.\nThree years before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by an orthopedist for pain in the hips and lower back, and glucocorticoid injections were administered. Twenty-two months before the current admission, the patient presented to her primary care physician because of diarrhea; 4 months later, she was evaluated by her primary care physician for bloody diarrhea. Testing of a stool specimen for giardia antigen, cryptosporidium antigen, and Clostridioides difficile toxin was negative. The blood level of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase IgA was undetectable, and the level of IgA was normal. A stool culture grew Bacillus cereus. The patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist; colonoscopy reportedly revealed markedly erythematous mucosa in the rectum, ending 10 cm proximal to the anus, with granularity and loss of vascularity. A biopsy specimen obtained during the colonoscopy reportedly showed evidence of diffuse active chronic colitis. Treatment with mesalamine was started, but her symptoms did not abate; the treatment was stopped after 4 months.\nDuring the next several months, the patient noticed progressive dyspnea and fatigue with exercise. Eight months before the current admission, she reported diffuse body and joint aches, especially of the lower back and hips, which prevented her from being able to run. Seven months before the current admission, she reported erythema, swelling, and pruritus in the right eye.\nThree months before the current admission, there was a recurrence of bloody diarrhea, and colonoscopy was repeated. Examination reportedly revealed perianal skin tags; congested and erythematous mucosa in the rectum, which was biopsied; and two 5-mm colonic polyps, which were excised.\nDr. T. Leif Helland: Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimens obtained during colonoscopy reportedly revealed a tubular adenoma and a sessile serrated polyp, as well as moderately active chronic colitis. Treatment with mesalamine was resumed.\nDr. Sporn: The next month, while doing heavy housework, the patient had new dyspnea and bilateral pleuritic chest-wall pain that was greater on the left side than on the right side, and she had to stop doing housework. The pain persisted for several days, the dyspnea worsened, and the patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital. On evaluation, she had diminished breath sounds and a normal electrocardiogram. Laboratory test results were notable for a normal N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level and normal white-cell and differential counts. The troponin I level was undetectable, and the D-dimer level was 3150 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500). A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Blood cultures were obtained.\nDr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Chest radiography reportedly revealed bilateral focal, patchy airspace opacities (Figure 1A). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly ruled out pulmonary embolism but showed multifocal pulmonary nodules that measured up to 18 mm in diameter (Figure 1B), pleural effusions, and a kidney stone in the left kidney.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Chest.\nDr. Sporn: A 5-day course of doxycycline, azithromycin, and prednisone was prescribed. Thirteen days later, approximately 2 months before the current admission, the patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospital because of continued dyspnea on exertion. The blood cultures that had been obtained during the previous visit to the emergency department were reportedly negative. White-cell and differential counts were normal, and the procalcitonin level was undetectable.\nDr. Shepard: Repeat chest radiography reportedly revealed persistent consolidations and increased pleural effusion.\nDr. Sporn: An additional 5-day course of prednisone and as-needed inhaled albuterol were prescribed. Four weeks later (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission), the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the other hospital. The patient reported pleuritic pain on the right side of the chest; her symptoms and imaging findings were thought to be related to multifocal pneumonia and parapneumonic effusions. A 3-week tapering course of prednisone was prescribed.\nAfter completion of the prednisone course, the patient reported dyspnea with labored breathing, orthopnea, and chest discomfort. Repeat chest CT was performed, and the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital.\nDr. Shepard: The repeat chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed resolution of some of the nodules in the lingula and right upper lobe but also an overall increased number of nodules (Figure 1C and 1D).\nDr. Sporn: Six days after her repeat chest CT (6 days before the current admission), the patient was evaluated at the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. She reported that the prednisone had reduced the pain in the right side of her chest. Her exercise capacity had decreased from being able to run 5 miles to having dyspnea after running less than half a mile. A review of systems was notable for occasional night sweats, weight gain of 15 kg in the past year, a faint rash on the abdomen, blurred vision with swelling of the right eyelid that had lasted for 3 weeks, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, diffuse joint stiffness and pain, and swelling of the fingers that limited some movements, such as opening jars. She had no fevers, chills, cough, nose or throat symptoms, eye pain or visual field loss, wheezing, palpitations, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits, urinary symptoms, or neurologic symptoms. She reported no sick contacts.\nMedical history was notable for hypothyroidism, multiple kidney stones, and depression. Medications included mesalamine, levothyroxine, and escitalopram, as well as lorazepam and inhaled albuterol as needed.\nThe patient had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 5 years but had quit approximately 20 years before the current admission. She used cannabis oil, but there was no other history of substance use. She previously worked as an educator but had left her job because of illness. She lived in a small town in New England with her spouse and three children. Birds and cats were kept in the home, and she had previously had a cat bite. She reported that she had had no other environmental or occupational exposures. There was no travel history except for a commercial vacation cruise. Family history included celiac disease in her mother and lung cancer in her maternal grandfather, who had been a long-term smoker.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Examination was notable for intermittent shallow breathing and faint crackles in the right lung. The right eyelid was erythematous and mildly swollen.\nBlood levels of creatine kinase, aldolase, and rheumatoid factor were normal. Anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Smith, anti-RNP, anti\u2013Jo-1, anti\u2013Scl-70, anti\u2013human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were not detected. Serum tests for cryptococcal antigen and 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan were negative, as were urine tests for blastomyces, coccidioides, and histoplasma antigens. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel were also negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

    "user_input": "Dr. Abigail L. Donovan: A 13-year-old boy with a history of attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of worsening depression, thoughts of self-injurious behavior, and suicidality.\nThe patient had a history of impulsivity and frequent episodes of self-injury, such as head-butting and cutting, which sometimes occurred while he was in treatment settings. Twelve months before the current presentation, he began to have suicidal ideation, with occasional suicidal planning and a suicide attempt. During the next year, the patient had 10 evaluations in the emergency department and six inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations.\nOne day before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from an inpatient psychiatric hospital, where he had been admitted and treated for 3 weeks because of urges to hurt himself. On the day of the current presentation, the patient visited his middle school and participated in therapy at home. Throughout the day, he noticed worsening depression and had recurrent thoughts of self-injury and suicide. He asked his parents to call emergency medical services because he felt unsafe in his home. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn arrival, the patient was in an agitated and combative state, reporting that he had changed his mind and no longer wanted to be in the hospital. Attempts at verbal deescalation were not effective. Treatment with intramuscular olanzapine was administered, and physical restraints were placed on his arms and legs. During the next 6 hours, the agitation decreased, and the physical restraints were removed. Additional history was obtained but was limited because the patient shrugged his shoulders in response to most questions. He described the school visit as difficult and uncomfortable. He did not indicate why he felt unsafe in his home; he reported that he had picked at scabs on his arms and legs in order to hurt himself and had ongoing suicidal ideation. The patient also reported difficulty sleeping and concentrating, as well as loss of interest and motivation, although he still enjoyed playing sports. He had no homicidal ideation, paranoid thoughts, or delusions.\nMedications included extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He lived in an urban area of New Hampshire with his mother, father, and sister.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 133/78 mm Hg, the heart rate 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared disheveled. There were scattered cuts and wounds in varying stages of healing on both arms. The patient was in a disengaged and agitated state. He had a depressed mood, a guarded affect, and difficulty concentrating. His speech was slow and soft, with reduced prosody. His thought process was logical and linear; the thought content was notable for suicidal ideation. He had no loosening of associations, delusions, or hallucinations. Insight and judgment were poor.\nThe patient was deemed to be at high risk for harm and was transferred to the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department. Transfer to an inpatient psychiatric hospital was requested, but no beds were available at any facility in the region. During the next 6 weeks, while the patient was awaiting admission to an inpatient psychiatric hospital, treatment with extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone was continued, and treatment with sertraline, diphenhydramine, and melatonin was initiated. He had frequent episodes of agitation, which led to the administration of oral clonidine or oral or intramuscular olanzapine as needed. He also had several episodes of self-injury; surveillance was heightened, with well-being checks performed every 15 minutes.\nOn day 41 in the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department, agitation developed, and a dose of oral olanzapine was administered in addition to scheduled medications. One hour later, agitation continued, and a dose of intramuscular olanzapine was administered. After the administration of intramuscular olanzapine, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 119/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air.\nThe next morning, the blood pressure was 146/87 mm Hg and the heart rate 52 beats per minute. There were no new symptoms; the examination was unchanged. Twelve hours later, the blood pressure was 69/39 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. The patient reported malaise and lightheadedness with standing, as well as nausea and abdominal pain. He appeared pale, tired, and lethargic. Oral rehydration was encouraged. One hour later, the blood pressure was 94/50 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. Three hours after the onset of hypotension, the blood pressure was 79/45 mm Hg and the heart rate 85 beats per minute.\nBlood and urine toxicologic screening was negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A blood specimen was obtained for culture. Intravenous fluids, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone were administered. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the pediatric medical service of this hospital.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range, Hospital Day 42\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201316.0, 12.8\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 39.3\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201313,500, 4390\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 367,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 138\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 3.7\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 104\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 26\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 6\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.76\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 132\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 9.3\nMagnesium (mg/dl), 1.7\u20132.4, 2.0\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), 0.0\u20138.0, 32.3\nLactic acid (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.0, 1.0\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201333, 15\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201332, 16\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 57\u2013254, 106\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 0.5\n\nA diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Jeffrey M. Sumner (Pediatrics): An 8-week-old male infant was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital because of inconsolable crying, lethargy, weakness, and hypoxemia.\nThe patient had been well until 7 days before the current presentation, when irritability and frequent crying developed. One day before the current presentation, the episodes of crying increased in duration, and the patient\u2019s grandmother noticed that he cried more intensely when the right side of his abdomen was touched. The patient was evaluated at the pediatric primary care clinic of another hospital. The vital signs and physical examination were reportedly normal, and a diagnosis of discomfort due to gastrointestinal gas was considered.\nAfter the patient returned home, he had a crying episode that lasted for multiple hours while he was awake; the crying stopped while he was fully asleep. After he woke up, the crying continued for 8 hours and became weaker. During breast-feeding, the patient fed less vigorously than usual, and the latch onto the nipple was weaker. That night, the crying continued, and the patient became inconsolable. He had frantic movements of the arms and legs and slept only 1 hour. On the day of the current presentation, the inconsolable crying continued. The patient did not latch onto the nipple, and his mother expressed breast milk directly into his mouth. A family member called the pediatric primary care clinic and was instructed to bring the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family members. There had been no change in the frequency of wet diapers; the last bowel movement had occurred 2 days before this presentation. The patient had been born at a gestational age of 39 weeks 1 day by a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery after a normal pregnancy. The birth weight had been 4.5 kg (98th percentile), the length 54.6 cm (99th percentile), and the head circumference 36.5 cm (94th percentile). The patient had met normal developmental milestones. He had not yet received the routine immunizations recommended for 2-month-old infants. Medications included vitamin D supplements; there were no known medication allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with his grandmother, who primarily cared for him, as well as his mother, father, and sister. His mother had depression, anxiety, and anemia. His father and sister were healthy.\nOn examination, the axillary temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/76 mm Hg, the heart rate 153 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 7.1 kg (99th percentile), the height 62.5 cm (>99th percentile), and the head circumference 41.5 cm (99th percentile). The patient was alert but irritable. He cried weakly and could not be soothed. The anterior fontanelle was open, soft, and flat. The mucous membranes were moist. The heart rate was tachycardic and regular. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft, with no hepatosplenomegaly. The results of the testicular examination were normal. There was no rash.\nThe blood levels of glucose, lactic acid, lipase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 621,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000); the remainder of the complete blood count and differential count was normal. The results of urinalysis and urine toxicology screening were normal. Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza A and B viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for culture. Radiography of the chest and abdomen and ultrasonography of the abdomen showed no abnormalities.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range, On Admission\n\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 5000\u201319,500, 5480\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 10.0\u201318.0, 12.8\nHematocrit (%), 31.0\u201355.0, 37.5\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 621,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 136\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 5.4\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013106, 102\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 22\u201327, 18\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 5\u201320, 8\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.30\u20131.00, 0.27\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 108\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 10.8\nLactic acid (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.0, 1.8\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201380, 43\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 26\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 122\u2013469, 658\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), <1.2, 3.1\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 4.8\nGlobulin (g/dl), 1.9\u20134.1, 1.8\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.0\u20138.3, 6.6\n\nWhile the patient was in the emergency department, he remained irritable and did not attain a calm awake state. He was admitted to this hospital. Four hours after presentation, lethargy developed. Additional testing was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture was performed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The CSF glucose level was 54 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and the CSF protein level was 104 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55); there were 1055 red cells per microliter and 2 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 70% were lymphocytes. A diagnosis of meningitis was considered. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir was started.\nSix hours after presentation, increased work of breathing developed, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 100%. The patient was transferred to the PICU.\nDr. Sarah A. Murphy: On arrival at the PICU, the patient was difficult to arouse. He had grunting respirations, head-bobbing, intercostal retractions, and an exaggerated abdominal breathing pattern. With vigorous stimulation, the patient had a weak hypophonic cry, gurgling, and stertor on inspiration. Ptosis was present in both eyes. When the eyes were opened by the examiner, the pupils were equal, round, and reactive. The face appeared symmetric and placid. There were few spontaneous movements of the arms, and the patient did not move his arms against gravity. There was no spontaneous movement of the legs, and diffuse hypotonia was present. Muscle bulk was normal and symmetric. Reflexes were decreased but preserved.\nTracheal intubation was performed, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Tachycardia and hypertension persisted despite the administration of boluses of sedative and analgesic agents and the initiation of continuous infusions of opioids and benzodiazepines.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

Walton (Medicine): A 67-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of headache and retro-orbital pain.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 10 months before the current admission, when a photosensitive, erythematous, papular rash developed on the forearms a few weeks after she had started treatment with hydrochlorothiazide. Over the next 7 months, an intermittent, painless, nonpruritic, erythematous, annular rash developed on the trunk and the proximal portions of the arms and legs.\nThree months before the current presentation, the rashes worsened, and the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist at another hospital. The thyrotropin level was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of a punch-biopsy specimen of abdominal skin reportedly showed spongiotic dermatitis with superficial perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory-cell infiltrate with eosinophils; neither vasculitis nor dermal mucin was found. The rashes were thought to be related to medication; treatment with amlodipine was started, and hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. She was treated with topical triamcinolone ointment. The photosensitive rash on the forearms resolved, and the annular rash on the trunk abated.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults, First Hospital), 3 Mo before Current Admission (First Hospital), Reference Range (Adults, This Hospital), On Current Admission (This Hospital)\n\nAntinuclear antibody, Negative, Positive at 1:320 with a speckled pattern, Negative at 1:80 and 1:160, Positive at 1:640 with a homogeneous pattern\nAnti-dsDNA antibody (U), 0\u201330.0, 16.3, Negative, Negative\nAnti-RNP antibody (U), 0\u201320, 3, 0\u201319.99, 1.48\nAnti-Smith antibody (U), 0\u201320, 4, 0\u201319.99, 2.74\nAnti-SSA antibody (U), 0\u201320, 71, 0\u201319.99, 80.76\nAnti-SSB antibody (U), 0\u201320, 7, 0\u201319.99, 6.69\n\nTen days after the evaluation at the first hospital, and 8 weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to the emergency department of a second hospital because of progressive temporal headache with retro-orbital pain on the left side that had lasted for 3 days. The physical examination was reportedly normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 19). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. Computed tomography (CT) of the head was performed and reportedly showed mild periventricular white-matter disease with no acute intracranial abnormality. CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed no intracranial aneurysm, stenosis, or occlusion. The patient was discharged home.\nThe next morning, the patient awoke with double vision. The headache had resolved. She presented to a neuro-ophthalmology urgent care clinic associated with this hospital. The patient reported persistent pain in the left eye, which was worse with abduction, as well as photosensitivity and an episode of pain in the left side of the jaw in the preceding week. She had normal visual acuity, color vision, visual fields, and afferent visual function. The optic disks were normal, sharp, and flat. The left eye had esotropia and hypertropia, as well as a limitation in abduction. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 11 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level was 3.0 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). A presumptive diagnosis of acute left sixth cranial nerve palsy associated with cerebral microvascular disease was considered. Corrective treatment with eye patching was recommended, and the double vision resolved over the next 3 weeks.\nEight weeks after she had presented to the emergency department of the second hospital, the patient presented to the emergency department of a third hospital because similar symptoms had developed in her right eye. She reported having headache with retro-orbital pain on the right side over the past 3 days, accompanied by changes in her color vision and occasional floaters. The physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of 159/66 mm Hg and an abduction deficit of the right eye. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 17 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 30), and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was 1.64 mg per liter (reference value, <3.00). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. A screening test for Lyme disease antibodies was negative.\nDr. Jeremy N. Ford: Cross-sectional imaging of the head and orbits had been performed at the first hospital, and the results were reinterpreted at the third hospital. CT of the head (Figure 1A and 1B) reportedly showed stranding of the intraconal fat in the right orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography of the head, neck, and orbits (performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material) reportedly showed abnormal enhancement and edema of the optic nerve and surrounding tissue on the right side. On my directed review of the MRI (Figure 1C through 1F), I found that the mild edema and enhancement predominantly involved the optic-nerve sheath and intraconal fat, which confirmed the findings on CT of the head. The optic nerve itself was largely spared. The temporomandibular joints were partially visible, and there was mild periarticular edema and enhancement of the left joint. On T2-weighted imaging, scattered hyperintense foci were seen in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, a nonspecific finding most likely attributable to chronic small-vessel disease.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Walton: Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was transferred to the neurology unit of this hospital. On evaluation, she reported persistent double vision and pain on right lateral gaze but resolution of the retro-orbital headache. She also reported a recent mild flare of an erythematous, annular rash, as well as recent hair thinning and long-standing Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Review of systems was negative for fever, night sweats, weight loss, joint erythema or swelling, muscle stiffness or pain, scalp or temple tenderness, jaw claudication, recurrent sinusitis, nasal crusting, epistaxis, cough, hoarseness, cough or shortness of breath, hemoptysis, dry mouth or dry eyes, oral ulcers, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, hearing changes, paresthesia, weakness in the arms and legs, or changes in the nails. There were no gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms.\nThe patient had a remote history of Graves\u2019 disease with orbitopathy that had been diagnosed and treated more than two decades before this presentation. The medical history was also notable for hypothyroidism, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cholecystectomy, ovary-sparing hysterectomy, and lumpectomy for estrogen receptor\u2013positive, progesterone receptor\u2013positive breast cancer. A surveillance mammogram obtained in the previous month had reportedly been normal. She had received three vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Medications included atorvastatin, amlodipine, levothyroxine, and tamoxifen. A rash had occurred after the previous use of hydrochlorothiazide. She was married and lived in coastal Massachusetts. She drank wine rarely and did not use tobacco or other substances. Her family history was notable for a maternal aunt with thyroid disease and a child with vitiligo.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the pulse 68 beats per minute, the blood pressure 173/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A few scattered erythematous macules were present on the abdomen, including a well-healed punch-biopsy site. A few telangiectasias were observed on the face. There was no rash on the face or scalp, and no sclerodactyly was observed. The hair was normal in pattern and distribution. There was no conjunctival injection. Extraocular movements were normal except for abduction of the right eye, which was limited and caused pain. There was no proptosis or lid lag. Visual acuity was 20/25 in the left eye and 20/40 with red color desaturation in the right eye. The right optic disk appeared pale as compared with the left optic disk. The remainder of the general and neurologic examination was normal.\nAn electrocardiogram was normal. The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, albumin, and globulin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 6 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level was 0.6 mg per liter. Screening tests for antibodies to hepatitis B virus core antigen, hepatitis C virus, histone, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative, as were tests for Lyme disease antibodies, syphilis antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and varicella\u2013zoster virus IgM; varicella\u2013zoster virus IgG was detected. A test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and serum and urine toxicology screens were also negative.\nA lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear, with an opening pressure of 14 cm of water. Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF showed rare mononuclear cells and no organisms. The CSF glucose level was 86 mg per deciliter (4.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and the CSF protein level was 30 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were no nucleated cells present.\nOn the second day, testing for antibodies to bartonella was negative. The levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme, C3, and C4 were normal, as were the results of serum free light-chain testing, serum protein electrophoresis, and urinalysis. The IgG4 level was 137.3 mg per deciliter (reference range, 3.9 to 86.4); the levels of other IgG subclasses were normal. Testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \u03b22-glycoprotein 1 antibodies was negative, as was CSF testing for cryptococcal antigen and varicella\u2013zoster virus IgM.\nDr. Ford: CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no lymphadenopathy; there was hepatic steatosis and a 2-mm right apical nodule. MRI of the head and whole spine, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed asymmetric enhancement surrounding the intraorbital and intracanalicular segments of the right optic-nerve sheath and intraconal fat. No abnormal spinal cord enhancement was observed. Ultrasonography of the temporal arteries showed no halo sign.\nDr. Walton: A diagnostic test was performed.",

Three weeks before the current evaluation, she presented to another hospital with fever, confusion, and word-finding difficulties. At the time of that presentation, the patient was inattentive and disoriented, and mild expressive aphasia without motor deficits was present. She had a large, bleeding exophytic mass in the right breast.\nDr. Janice N. Thai: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed a wedge-shaped area of low density in the left temporoparietal region. This finding is consistent with acute infarction.\nDr. Shahamatdar: A screening test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was positive. Laboratory studies, including a complete blood count, were notable for a hemoglobin level of 4.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 11.0 to 15.0), a mean corpuscular volume of 69.7 fl (reference range, 80.0 to 100.0), and a platelet count of 922,000 per microliter (reference range, 130,000 to 400,000).\nDr. Thai: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a large cystic and solid mass in the right breast, measuring 14.9 cm by 16.2 cm by 20.0 cm (Figure 1A and 1B). Associated prominence of the intramammary, internal mammary, subpectoral, and axillary lymph nodes was observed. Heterogeneous lesions of the ribs and pulmonary nodules that could indicate metastatic disease were also noted (Figure 1C). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, provided additional evidence of ischemic stroke and showed no evidence of intracranial metastases (Figure 1D and 1E).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Shahamatdar: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Packed red cells were transfused, and a compressive bandage was applied to the breast lesion. By hospital day 2, the patient\u2019s confusion and inattention had resolved, but mild expressive aphasia persisted. Consent was obtained from the patient, and she underwent incisional biopsy of the breast lesion while under local anesthesia. The patient\u2019s hospitalization was complicated by cellulitis in the right arm at the site where a peripheral intravenous catheter had been placed, for which she was treated with intravenous antibiotic agents. She was discharged on hospital day 11 with pathological results pending, and follow-up was planned with the breast oncology clinic of this hospital.\nFour days after discharge, the patient had a sudden onset of profuse bleeding from the breast lesion, which led to hypotension, and she was again admitted to the other hospital. She received a total of 5 units of packed red cells, and bleeding was managed conservatively with sterile gauze and compressive bandaging. No further episodes of bleeding occurred. On hospital day 4, she was discharged home with plans to attend a multidisciplinary oncology evaluation at this hospital 2 days later.\nIn the breast oncology clinic, the patient reported worsening discomfort, bleeding, and drainage from the breast mass and the associated wound. She noted that progressive fatigue had developed in recent weeks but reported no fever or chills. She had first noted a palpable lesion in the right breast when she was 32 years of age, approximately 27 years before the current presentation. The patient had pursued an evaluation with breast imaging at that time, and she recollected that the lesion had been characterized as a benign finding. A biopsy had not been performed. During the intervening years, she had not pursued routine medical care, including breast imaging. She attributed the lack of medical follow-up to ongoing demands related to caring for her young child and stressors in her personal and work life. She reported that slow but steady growth of the breast lesion had occurred during those years. Approximately 2 years before the current presentation, the patient had noted more rapid growth of the lesion with progressive skin breakdown, discomfort, and drainage that she thought was related to chronic infection.\nMenarche had occurred when the patient was 10 years of age and menopause at 50 years of age. The patient had had one pregnancy, and she had used hormonal contraception for a total of 15 years during her lifetime. She had not received any hormone-replacement therapy. At the time of the current presentation, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score was 1 (assessed on a scale of 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater disability). Medications included amlodipine, atorvastatin, ferrous sulfate, and polyethylene glycol. Her family history included breast cancer in her maternal aunt. She lived in New England with her adult son and was a small-business owner. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke cigarettes.\nOn physical examination, the oral temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/81 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A large, fungating breast mass was present, which had foci of necrosis and areas of dried blood without palpable ipsilateral lymphadenopathy. Auscultation of the heart was notable for tachycardia without murmur. A neurologic examination did not reveal motor deficits, and the previously reported expressive aphasia had resolved. The patient was attentive and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The affect and mood were appropriate, and she did not report hallucinations, suicidal ideation, or symptoms of depression. She had normal insight and capacity with regard to the nature of her diagnosis and recent clinical course.\nManagement decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Bart K. Chwalisz: A 65-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of bilateral eye pain and decreased vision.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 days before this admission, when constant aching pain developed in the left eye and the left side of the head. During the next few days, the vision in the left eye gradually became blurry. Three days before this admission, redness developed in the right eye. The patient used tetrahydrozoline eye drops, but symptoms did not abate. One day before this admission, pain developed in the right eye that was similar to the pain in the left eye. The patient sought evaluation by his primary care physician, who recommended that he present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival, the patient rated the eye pain and headache at 2 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain was not worse with eye movement or accompanied by flashing lights, floaters, or discharge. The patient reported no trauma but noted weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past 2 weeks, as well as pain with chewing food. He did not have scalp tenderness, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, numbness, weakness, or slurred speech.\nThe patient had a history of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia, which had been diagnosed 2 years before this admission and treated with plasmapheresis, dexamethasone, and four cycles of bortezomib (with discontinuation of bortezomib after 4 months because of peripheral neuropathy), as well as six cycles of bendamustine. During the 9 months that followed the completion of treatment with bendamustine, there was active surveillance of the blood IgM level. One month before this admission, the IgM level was 1001 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334), and biopsy of the bone marrow revealed persistent disease. One week before this admission, the patient took his first dose of ibrutinib, which had been prescribed 3 months earlier.\nOther medical history included latent tuberculosis, depression, anxiety, prediabetes, folate deficiency, and seasonal allergies. Medications included ibrutinib, isoniazid, pyridoxine, sertraline, citalopram, hydroxyzine, cetirizine, fluticasone nasal spray, and a multivitamin. Rituximab had caused anaphylaxis. The patient did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. He was originally from Central America and had immigrated to the United States 50 years earlier; 1 month earlier, he had moved from the West Coast to an urban area of New England. He lived in an apartment with his niece and cousins and worked in construction. His family history was unknown.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 104/69 mm Hg, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye with correction. On confrontation testing, visual fields in the left eye were deficient in the inferior temporal and nasal aspects. On the Ishihara color test, all plates were identified with the right eye but only the control plate was identified with the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the left eye. There was no proptosis. Subconjunctival hemorrhage was present in the right eye; pterygia were present in both eyes. On funduscopic examination, the optic disk in the left eye was edematous. Results of tests of cranial nerve function, power, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait were normal.\nThe blood hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), the hematocrit 39.8% (reference range, 41.0 to 53.0), the white-cell count 8090 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), and the platelet count 131,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The IgM level was 540 mg per deciliter; the level of IgM kappa M component in the gamma region was 0.36 g per deciliter. Blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney and liver function. Tests for Lyme disease, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, and bartonellosis were negative. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range, On Admission\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 12.5  \nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 39.8  \nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 131,000  \nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 8090  \n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 4290  \nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 2990  \nMonocytes, 200\u20131200, 650  \nEosinophils, 0\u2013900, 80  \nBasophils, 0\u2013300, 80  \n\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201320, 19  \nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 12.9  \nProthrombin-time international normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.0  \n\nIgG (mg/dl), 614\u20131295, 951  \nIgA (mg/dl), 69\u2013309, 23  \nIgM (mg/dl), 53\u2013334, 540  \n\nSerum protein electrophoresis, No M component, IgM kappa M component in the gamma region at a level of 0.36 g/dl  \n\nKappa light chain (mg/dl), 3.3\u201319.4, 145.1  \nLambda light chain (mg/dl), 5.7\u201326.3, 11.4  \n\nDr. Javier M.
