    "user_input": "Dr. David J. Bozym (Medicine): A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypokalemia and paranoid thoughts.\nSix months before the current admission, discomfort on the right side of the chest developed, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital.\nDr. Mark C. Murphy: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung that measured 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm, as well as bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImages Obtained 6 Months before Current Admission.\nDr. Bozym: An endobronchial ultrasound\u2013guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node was performed. Cytologic examination of the specimen revealed small-cell carcinoma.\nFive months before the current admission, the patient sought a second opinion in the oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient was counseled about the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer and the need for additional imaging before consideration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Additional imaging was scheduled, along with a follow-up appointment. The patient did not undergo additional imaging and did not attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic of either this hospital or the other hospital.\nSix weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed swelling of both legs. Ten days before this admission, the swelling had not abated, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient described himself as generally healthy and did not report any chronic health conditions. He reported no fever, chills, shortness of breath, or pain. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s brother. The patient had been pursuing alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer that included a strict diet and intravenous infusions, and he had not shared the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer with his family until several days earlier. The patient\u2019s brother believed that the patient was in denial about the diagnosis.\nWhen the patient was 12 years of age, he had received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which had been treated with radiation therapy and splenectomy. Fifteen years before this presentation, ischemic colitis had been treated with small-bowel resection. One year before this presentation, deep-vein thrombosis had been treated with a 4-month course of anticoagulation. There was no history of psychiatric disease. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies; he did not disclose details about the infusions that he had received as alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents. He was divorced and frequently visited his children. He worked part-time as a skilled tradesman. Family members reported that he was a lifelong nonsmoker.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 167/95 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and appeared well, but he looked thinner than he had looked during his evaluation at the oncology clinic 5 months earlier. The abdomen had a healed surgical scar, and the legs had symmetric 1+ edema. The blood potassium level was 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.1); the white-cell count was 14,630 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), 10 Days before Current Admission, On Current Admission\n\nBlood\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 11.4, 12.0\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 33.6, 35.6\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 231,000, 213,000\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4000\u201311,000, 14,630, 13,530\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l)\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 12,200, 12,050\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 1670, 850\nMonocytes, 200\u20131200, 330, 380\nEosinophils, 0\u2013900, 0, 0\nBasophils, 0\u2013300, 20, 30\n\nSodium (mmol/liter), 136\u2013145, 135, 142\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.6\u20135.1, 2.6, 2.2\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013107, 90, 94\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 22\u201332, 34, 37\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 6\u201320, 26, 19\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.30, 0.94, 0.87\nGlucose (mg/dl), 65\u201399, 221, 165\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.9\u201310.3, 8.7, 9.2\nMagnesium (mg/dl), 1.7\u20132.4, 2.1, 2.4\nPhosphorus (mg/dl), 2.4\u20134.7, 2.1, 1.4\nAnion gap (mmol/liter), 3\u201317, 11, 11\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201350, 202, 196\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 15\u201341, 134, 115\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 32\u2013100, 505, 451\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.2, 1.0, 2.0\nGlobulin (g/dl), 1.9\u20134.1, 3.3, 3.4\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.5\u20135.2, 2.4, 2.4\nAmmonia (\u00b5mol/liter), 12\u201348, \u2014, 51\nC\u2011reactive protein (mg/liter), 0.0\u20130.8, 26.6, \u2014\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201313, 51, \u2014\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), 20\u2013300, 1058, \u2014\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 13.2, \u2014\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.0, \u2014\nD\u2011dimer (ng/ml), 150\u2013400, 3119, \u2014\nFibrinogen (mg/dl), 150\u2013400, 465, \u2014\n\nDr. Murphy: CT pulmonary angiography of the chest (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a marked increase in the size of the left-lung mass, which now measured 9.3 cm by 4.6 cm, as well as enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed numerous new ill-defined rim-enhancing hepatic lesions, which measured up to 8.0 cm in diameter; an adrenal mass, which measured 4.1 cm by 3.4 cm; and thrombosis of the branches of the right portal vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImages Obtained on Current Admission.\nDr. Bozym: Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the next 3 days, additional supplemental potassium was administered. During follow-up interviews, the patient acknowledged the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer, but he did not explain why he had not shared the diagnosis with his family or provide details about the alternative treatment that he had pursued. On the fourth hospital day, the blood potassium level increased, and the patient asked to go home. He stated that he was willing to attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic, but he was evasive when chemotherapy and immunotherapy were discussed. The patient was discharged.\nOne week after discharge, and 1 day before the current admission, the patient\u2019s father accompanied the patient to receive massage therapy and an intravenous infusion as alternative treatment. During the infusion, the patient abruptly became volatile, agitated, and angry. On the drive home, he refused to close the window and stared into the distance. He stated that doctors had cast spells on him during his recent hospitalization and that he had killed his oldest child, which was not true.\nThe next day, the patient borrowed his brother\u2019s car without permission and drove across the state. After he returned home, family members brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient stated that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d for being in the hospital. He initially reported no symptoms, but on specific questioning, he acknowledged fatigue, weight loss, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and ongoing leg swelling. He reported that he did not feel confused, afraid, or worried and that he had no suicidal or homicidal thoughts or auditory or visual hallucinations. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family members. The patient had not slept for several days. His aggressive and erratic behavior and delusions were not typical, although he could become easily angered and had a long-standing belief that his doctors had administered radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma to make money.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 194/106 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The patient alternated between being alert and lethargic, and he could state the names of his children but not their ages. He was cooperative but intermittently paused and stared; he was not distracted by external stimuli, but he seemed to be responding to internal stimuli. He spoke only a couple of words at a time and answered most questions by nodding or shaking his head. There was generalized weakness, which was most pronounced in the proximal muscle groups. The leg edema was unchanged, and the skin appeared abnormally tan; there was no scleral icterus, sublingual jaundice, or asterixis.\nThe blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter, the carbon dioxide level 37 mmol per liter (reference range, 22 to 32), and the ammonia level 51 \u03bcmol per liter (87 \u03bcg per deciliter; reference range, 12 to 48 \u03bcmol per liter [20 to 82 \u03bcg per deciliter]). The white-cell count was 13,530 per microliter. Urinalysis was normal, and urine and blood toxicologic testing was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, was normal. Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Gregory M. Cote: A 52-year-old man with a metastatic solitary fibrous tumor was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 1.5 years before the current admission, when dysuria and pain in the lower abdomen and left leg developed after a motor vehicle accident. At another hospital, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reportedly revealed an incidental 14-cm necrotic mass in the pelvis, anterior to the bladder. Biopsy of the mass was reportedly diagnostic of a solitary fibrous tumor.\nThe patient was referred to the multidisciplinary oncology clinic of this hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed for staging, revealed two 9-mm nodules in the left lung. The patient was treated with a 3-month course of dacarbazine chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy targeting the pelvic mass, and then he underwent surgical resection of the pelvic tumor, including partial cystectomy and placement of a ureteral stent. Pathological examination of the resected specimen (Figure 1) confirmed the diagnosis of spindle-cell sarcoma with features consistent with a dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumor. Immunohistochemical staining of the resected specimen revealed signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and CD34 in the tumor cells. Stereotactic radiation therapy for the lung nodules was also administered.\nFIGURE 1\n\nSpecimen of the Resected Mass.\nHowever, metastatic disease progressed in the lungs, chest, bladder, and right leg. Over the subsequent 12-month period, the patient underwent serial treatment with four different chemotherapeutic regimens: pazopanib, doxorubicin with olaratumab, gemcitabine with docetaxel, and vinorelbine. Palliative radiation therapy for a painful leg metastasis was also provided.\nEleven days after the initiation of vinorelbine chemotherapy and 30 days before the current admission, the patient was admitted to this hospital with fever (temperature, 38.3\u00b0C), neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, 770 per microliter; reference range, 1800 to 7700), and pneumonia in the left lower lobe.\nDr. Reece J. Goiffon: CT of the chest and abdomen (Figure 2A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed known metastatic involvement of the lungs, bladder, retroperitoneum, peritoneum, skeletal muscles, and subcutaneous fat. There was no metastatic involvement of the adrenal glands, pancreas, or liver.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Cote: Empirical treatment with cefepime was administered. Over the next several days, the neutropenia and fever resolved and the pneumonia abated. On the seventh hospital day, the patient was discharged home with a follow-up visit scheduled in the oncology clinic.\nEleven days after hospital discharge and 12 days before the current admission, the patient attended a scheduled outpatient visit for an infusion. He reported weakness and appeared confused. A fingerstick glucose level was 47 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter). Supplemental oral and intravenous glucose was administered, and his mental status improved, but fingerstick glucose levels remained below 70 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter). Review of fingerstick glucose measurements obtained during the patient\u2019s recent hospitalization showed multiple levels ranging from 50 to 60 mg per deciliter (2.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter).\nThe patient was admitted to the oncology unit of this hospital for the management of hypoglycemia. Laboratory test results from the second hospital admission are shown in Table 1. While the patient was in the hospital, he began to have diaphoresis that correlated with episodes of hypoglycemia, for which he received orange juice and dextrose. On evaluation by a dietitian, he was found to be meeting anticipated caloric requirements. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day; the blood glucose level was 55 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter) before discharge.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), 12 Days before Current Admission (Second Admission Day 1), 11 Days before Current Admission (Second Admission Day 2), 6 Days before Current Admission (Follow-up Visit), Current Admission Day 1, Current Admission Day 2\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 7.5, 6.8, 8.0, 7.9, 7.4\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 23.7, 21.7, 25.0, 24.8, 23.6\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 6350, 5390, 6740, 11,120, 6330\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 106,000, 85,000, 87,000, 91,000, 74,000\n\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 134, 136, 137, 139, 139\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 3.3, 3.4, 4.3, 4.0, 3.8\nChloride (mmol/liter), 100\u2013108, 97, 100, 101, 106, 105\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 25, 23, 26, 23, 21\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 3, 3, 6, 4, 3\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.44, 0.32, 0.39, 0.40, 0.50\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 68, 45, 96, 49, 145\nPhosphorus (mg/dl), 2.6\u20134.5, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 3.6, 3.8\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 8.8, 8.7, 8.7, 9.8, 9.0\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 2.8, \u2014, 3.0, 3.1, \u2014\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 7, \u2014, 6, 10, \u2014\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201340, 22, \u2014, 20, 18, \u2014\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013115, 65, \u2014, 72, 72, \u2014\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 0.6, \u2014, 0.5, 0.6, \u2014\nInsulin (\u00b5U/ml), 2.6\u201325.0, \u2014, <0.2, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nC\u2011peptide (ng/ml), 1.1\u20134.4, \u2014, <0.1, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\n\u03b2\u2011Hydroxybutyrate (mmol/liter), <0.4, \u2014, <0.1, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nCortisol, morning (\u00b5g/dl), 5.0\u201325.0, \u2014, 13.5, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nRepeat cortisol, after cosyntropin (\u00b5g/dl), \u2014, \u2014, 21.7, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nLactate (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.2, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.9, \u2014\nTroponin T (ng/ml), <0.03, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, <0.01, \u2014\n\nThree days later and 6 days before the current admission, the patient attended the scheduled follow-up visit in the oncology clinic. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with trabectedin was initiated, along with pegfilgrastim and a 3-day tapering course of dexamethasone. The day after the dexamethasone course was completed, the patient reported increased fatigue and cough. Two days later, he was admitted to the oncology unit because of weakness and diaphoresis; a fingerstick glucose level was 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter).\nOn the current admission, review of systems was notable for fatigue; pain associated with tumors involving the back, shoulders, and right leg; numbness of the right leg; the use of an indwelling Foley catheter for 2 months owing to urinary retention; dull chest pain and intermittent dyspnea that had persisted for 4 months; and constipation. The patient had no recent anorexia, weight change, fever, chills, orthopnea, hemoptysis, light-headedness, dizziness, palpitations, syncope, nausea, or vomiting.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for transfusion-dependent anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (for which he had received metformin, although not in the previous 6 months), hypertension, a colonic tubular adenoma, a renal cyst, osteoarthritis, chronic low-back pain, and depression. He had undergone an appendectomy in the remote past. Medications included oral gabapentin, cyanocobalamin, tamsulosin, and finasteride; transdermal fentanyl; and oral acetaminophen, clonazepam, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and oxycodone as needed. He had no access to insulin or other hypoglycemic medications. There were no known adverse drug reactions.\nThe patient had formerly worked as a laborer and had been receiving disability benefits since the motor vehicle accident. He had previously consumed six beers per week and smoked one pack of cigarettes per day, but he had stopped drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco 1 year earlier. There was no history of other substance use. His family history of cancer included melanoma in his father, thyroid cancer in his sister, ovarian cancer in his maternal grandmother, leukemia in his maternal aunt, and sarcoma in his paternal uncle. His mother had hypertension and dyslipidemia, and a brother had diabetes. The patient had an adult child, who was healthy.\nThe tympanic temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Multiple tender, palpable masses were present, including masses on the left shoulder, neck, and left upper leg. A venous-access port was in place in the chest wall on the right side. The abdominal incision was well healed. A Foley catheter was in place, and there was pink-tinged urine. A faint rash was present on the lower abdomen at the site of previous radiation therapy. Edema was present in both legs. Laboratory test results from the current hospital admission are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Goiffon: A chest radiograph (Figure 2B) showed abundant metastatic pulmonary nodules. CT of the chest (Figure 2C and 2D), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed that the nodules had increased in size and quantity over a period of 1 month. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.\nDr. Cote: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, a leftward axis, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and intraventricular conduction delay.\nOn the first hospital day, although the patient was receiving a continuous infusion of dextrose, five bolus injections of dextrose and six glasses of orange juice were needed to increase the blood glucose level to more than 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter). On the morning of the second hospital day, the blood glucose level was 42 mg per deciliter (2.3 mmol per liter). Treatment with oral prednisone was initiated.\nA diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Katherine A. Sparger: A newborn girl was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of this hospital after a planned delivery by cesarean section because of a neck mass.\nDuring pregnancy, the patient\u2019s mother was 41 years old (gravida 3, para 1) and received prenatal care at another hospital. At 7 weeks of gestation, vaginal bleeding occurred because of a subchorionic hematoma. At 10 weeks of gestation, the mother\u2019s blood thyrotropin level was 0.01 \u03bcU per milliliter (reference range, 0.40 to 5.00); levels of free thyroxine (free T4) and total triiodothyronine (total T3) were not obtained. At 19 weeks of gestation, the thyrotropin level was 0.44 \u03bcU per milliliter and an ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy was normal. During the third trimester, gestational diabetes was diagnosed; glycemic control was maintained with dietary changes.\nFour weeks before delivery, at 34 weeks 6 days of gestation, a routine transvaginal ultrasonographic survey of fetal growth revealed a new mass on the right side of the fetus\u2019s neck that measured 2.6 cm by 3.4 cm by 3.0 cm. The mother was referred to the obstetrics clinic of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nDr. Randheer Shailam: At 35 weeks 6 days of gestation, obstetrical ultrasonography performed at this hospital (Figure 1A) confirmed the presence of a 4.6-cm mass on the right side of the neck. The mass was hyperechoic and well circumscribed and had internal vascularity; the remainder of the survey of fetal anatomy was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the fetus, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 1B, 1C, and 1D), revealed displacement of the trachea without compression.\nFIGURE 1\n\nPrenatal Imaging Studies.\nDr. Sparger: For multiple weeks, the fetal biophysical profile score was 8 out of 8, indicating normal breathing motion, movement, tone, and amniotic fluid volume. The mother met with providers from Maternal\u2013Fetal Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Otolaryngology, and Neonatology to discuss the plan for delivery and neonatal airway management at birth, including the possibility of an ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure. The mother initially had a preference for a vaginal delivery, given her history of a successful vaginal delivery with a previous pregnancy. However, after conversations with Maternal\u2013Fetal Medicine providers, the decision was made to proceed with a scheduled cesarean section at 39 weeks of gestation to minimize the risks of labor dystocia and asynclitism due to fetal neck position and any associated birth trauma, as well as to allow for controlled timing of the delivery with multidisciplinary team members present.\nThe mother had a history of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and known mutations in both copies of the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Eleven years earlier, her first pregnancy had ended at full term with a vaginal delivery. Three years earlier, her second pregnancy had ended at 13 weeks of gestation with elective termination because of the diagnosis of pentalogy of Cantrell (a syndrome of midline abdominal and chest wall defects, including ectopia cordis and omphalocele). During her current pregnancy, she had taken prenatal vitamins, cholecalciferol, and pyridoxine, as well as lorazepam as needed for anxiety. Prenatal screening tests were negative for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B; equivocal for immunity to rubella; and positive for group B streptococcal colonization.\nThe patient (baby) had a healthy father and sister. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her maternal grandmother, sleep apnea in her paternal grandfather, and diabetes in her paternal grandmother. In addition, her maternal aunt had thyrotoxicosis, a paternal uncle had diabetes, and another paternal uncle had blindness, deafness, and cognitive developmental delay.\nAt 39 weeks of gestation, the baby was delivered by cesarean section. The birth weight was 3060 g (35th percentile), the length 48 cm (26th percentile), and the head circumference 34.5 cm (60th percentile). She had a spontaneous cry, decreased tone, and spontaneous respirations. There was a large firm mass on the right side of the neck. The 1-minute Apgar score was 6.\nAt 3 minutes of life, increased work of breathing developed; treatment with continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm of water was administered. At 5 minutes of life, the Apgar score was 7 but the increased work of breathing worsened, with nasal flaring, grunting, and subcostal retractions; the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) was increased to 100%. At 10 minutes of life, the Apgar score was 8. Direct laryngoscopy revealed deviation of the trachea, larynx, subglottis, and right piriform sinus. Tracheal intubation was performed with rigid bronchoscopy; because of clinically significant airway obstruction, tracheostomy was performed.\nAt 8 hours of life, the blood hemoglobin level was 10.0 g per deciliter (reference range for neonates, 13.5 to 19.5), the thyrotropin level 3.82 \u03bcU per milliliter, the alpha-fetoprotein level 107,048.0 ng per milliliter (reference range, <7.9), and the beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level 7.3 IU per milliliter (reference range, <50.0).

    "user_input": "Dr. J. Sawalla Guseh: A 38-year-old man was evaluated at the cardiology clinic of this hospital because of exertional chest discomfort.\nThe patient had been a competitive athlete in the past and had remained an avid runner. Approximately 15 years before the current evaluation, while he was running, he had episodes of flushing with diffuse cutaneous swelling involving the face, lips, hands, and trunk, along with hives on the abdomen and legs and associated dyspnea. The first episode occurred in autumn and the second episode the following summer. After the second episode, he lost consciousness while sitting on a bench. The next day, he was evaluated at an urgent care center. A Holter monitor was placed, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was reportedly normal. The patient consulted with an allergist, who made a diagnosis of food-related exercise-induced anaphylaxis with reactions to soybeans, chickpeas, and tahini, on the basis of the foods he had eaten before these episodes and the results of radioallergosorbent testing. An epinephrine autoinjector was prescribed for use during future episodes, but the anaphylaxis symptoms did not recur.\nApproximately 4 months before the current evaluation, during a routine 5-mile jog, the patient had a new sensation that he described as \u201cmy heart beating out of my chest.\u201d He rested, and the symptom subsided; he completed his run. One month later, during a bicycle ride, he had \u201ccrampy\u201d discomfort in the anterior chest, which abated when he stopped cycling. Two weeks before the current evaluation, during a jog of several miles, he had cramping pain in the anterior chest on the left side that gradually escalated over a 5-minute period. He started walking, and the pain abated; he ran for an additional 20 minutes without a recurrence of pain. He sought an evaluation in the cardiology clinic of this hospital to determine the cause of his symptoms and the safety of continued vigorous exercise.\nOn evaluation in the cardiology clinic, a review of systems was negative for dyspnea, recent syncope, orthopnea, edema, cough, hemoptysis, and recent allergic symptoms. The patient ran or cycled four times per week and had previously completed a marathon. His medical history included attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. Five years earlier, an episode of syncope had occurred in the context of multiple episodes of nonbloody diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and chills. His surgical history included two colonic polypectomies, one 6 years before this evaluation and the other 1 month before this evaluation; pathological examination of the polyps had revealed lymphoid aggregates and hyperplastic polyps. The patient took no medications and reported no adverse reactions to medications.\nThe patient worked in the financial sector and lived with his wife and children. He did not use tobacco, alcohol, or other substances. Multiple maternal relatives had had colon cancer, and an older brother had had colonic polyps removed in his fourth decade of life. There was a family history of hypertension.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 122/84 mm Hg (measured in both arms), the heart rate 54 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were mild expiratory wheezes; the remainder of the examination was normal.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities, findings that had been observed on tracings obtained 5 years earlier during an evaluation for presyncope; a TTE obtained at that time had been normal. Sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities had not been observed on tracings obtained 15 years earlier (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C). The white-cell count and platelet count were normal, as were blood levels of hemoglobin, electrolytes, calcium, and thyrotropin and results of renal-function tests. The high-sensitivity troponin level was 10 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14). Plasma metanephrines were undetectable, and the normetanephrine level was normal. The next day, a TTE showed no abnormalities of cardiac chamber size and function and no evidence of valvular dysfunction.\nFIGURE 1\n\nElectrocardiograms and Transthoracic Echocardiograms.\nAn ambulatory patch heart monitor, applied to evaluate cardiac rhythm over a 2-week period, revealed sinus rhythm without arrhythmia. A cardiopulmonary exercise stress test was performed; the patient exercised for 19 minutes 17 seconds according to a treadmill protocol that increased incrementally to maximal effort with a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.12 and a maximum heart rate of 181 beats per minute (99% of the age-predicted maximum). At peak effort, the stress test did not reproduce symptoms, and he stopped because of leg fatigue. An ECG showed 0.5-mm horizontal ST-segment depression in leads III, aVF, V3, and V6, along with isolated premature ventricular contractions. The ventilatory efficiency was normal.\nAdditional diagnostic testing was performed, and management decisions were made.",

After evaluation by her primary care physician, she was referred to a surgical clinic at another hospital; examination of a skin-biopsy specimen revealed ulcerated melanoma with positive margins. The patient was referred to the oncology clinic of this hospital.\nThree months before the current admission, a wide local excision of the scalp lesion and a neck lymph-node dissection were performed; examination of the specimens revealed metastatic melanoma in 2 of 26 lymph nodes. A diagnosis of stage IIIC melanoma was made. Molecular profiling identified the BRAF V600E mutation, and treatment with adjuvant therapy was planned to begin after the patient had recovered fully from surgery.\nOne month before the current admission, the patient was evaluated in the oncology clinic for initiation of treatment with a combination of dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (a MEK inhibitor) as targeted therapy for melanoma.

On the day of admission, the patient had worsening confusion and somnolence, and his wife brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn presentation, the patient was not able to provide any history but was accompanied by his wife, who described his recent symptoms. His medical record showed a 10-year history of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, which had initially been complicated by oral and genital ulcers and intermittent fever. During the following decade, flares of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had been associated with various manifestations: pulmonary embolism, iliac artery aneurysm and dissection, bilateral renal vein thrombosis, erythema nodosum, deep venous thrombosis, uveitis, an inferior vena cava clot complicated by superior vena cava syndrome that led to thrombectomy, and renal infarction. The flares of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had usually included oral ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, or fever.\nPast treatment for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had included azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Two years before this presentation, treatment with azathioprine and cyclosporine was discontinued and adalimumab initiated. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone resulted in flares of genital and oral ulcers. The frequency of adalimumab administration was increased to weekly, but genital and oral ulcers persisted. Thirteen months before this presentation, treatment with adalimumab was stopped and infliximab initiated. Diffuse arthralgias developed that were attributed to infliximab. Twelve months before this presentation, treatment with infliximab was stopped and golimumab initiated.\nOther medical history included an episode of lymphocyte-predominant meningitis, which had been diagnosed during an evaluation for headache, fever, and neck pain 17 months before this presentation. During the episode, there was a 72-hour delay in performing lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis because the patient had been taking apixaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. While he was awaiting lumbar puncture, broad-spectrum antibiotic agents were administered, and the headache, fever, and neck pain resolved. CSF analysis revealed normal levels of glucose and total protein, no red cells, and a nucleated-cell count of 88 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 97% lymphocytes and 3% monocytes. Nucleic acid amplification testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was negative, and Gram\u2019s staining revealed no organisms. Antimicrobial therapy was discontinued, and the patient was discharged home.\nThere was also a history of coronavirus disease 2019, which had been diagnosed 16 months before this presentation. Current medications included golimumab, apixaban, prednisone, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. There were no known allergies. The patient lived with his wife and four children. He had previously worked in construction; he had been released from prison 3 months before this presentation and was not currently working. He had a remote history of smoking tobacco; he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His grandmother had hypertension.\nOn examination in the emergency department, the patient was somnolent but arose in response to verbal stimuli. His level of alertness fluctuated, he was only intermittently able to answer simple questions, and he could not provide a coherent history of his illness. The temperature was 39.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 122/71 mm Hg, the heart rate 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.7. He was oriented to person and place but not to time. There was no neck stiffness. Mild injection in the left eye was present, but there were no oral or skin lesions. The patient was not able to participate fully in a neurologic examination, but he was able to move his arms and legs; no focal neurologic findings were noted on observation. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nBlood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were results of liver-function, kidney-function, and coagulation tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The blood acetaminophen level was less than 5.0 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 25.0); blood testing for ethanol was negative. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for respiratory viral pathogens was positive for human rhinovirus or enterovirus. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. Imaging studies were obtained.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Admission\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.7\u201317.5, 14.5\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 44.2\nMean corpuscular volume (fl), 80.0\u2013100.0, 91.3\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 11,760\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 9430\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 1100\nMonocytes, 200\u20131200, 1080\nEosinophils, 0\u2013900, 800\nBasophils, 0\u2013300, 300\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 208,000\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2 antibody and antigen, Nonreactive, Nonreactive\nTreponemal antibody, Nonreactive, Nonreactive\nCryptococcal antigen, Negative, Negative\nInterferon-\u03b3 release assay for tuberculosis, Negative, Negative\n\nC\u2011reactive protein (mg/liter), <8.0, 39.1\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201313, 24\n\nDr. Pamela W.

CT angiography of the head and neck, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed normal arterial and venous vasculature.\nDr. Suarez: Treatment with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with apixaban was stopped and heparin administered intravenously in anticipation of performing a lumbar puncture. Fever and headache abated, but the patient\u2019s mental status did not improve. Blood cultures showed no growth. On the fourth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was not obtained. CSF analysis revealed a normal total protein level, a glucose level of 40 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), a red-cell count of 2 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and a nucleated-cell count of 284 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 72% lymphocytes, 13% neutrophils, 11% monocytes, and 4% unclassified cells. Nucleic acid amplification testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was negative, and Gram\u2019s staining revealed no organisms. No acid-fast bacilli were observed on a mycobacterial smear, and no fungi were seen on examination of a fungal wet preparation. Testing of the CSF for cryptococcal antigen and enterovirus RNA was negative.\nAdditional diagnostic testing was performed, and a diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Danielle C. Crabtree (Medicine): A 37-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, myalgia, jaundice, and hypoxemia.\nThe patient had been healthy until 9 days before this admission, when malaise, fatigue, and generalized weakness developed. The symptoms were severe, and he slept almost all day and night. Seven days before this admission, the patient had an oral temperature of 39.4\u00b0C, and headache developed, as well as achiness and stiffness in the arms, shoulders, knees, and legs. He was not able to eat a full meal because of decreased appetite and nausea. He did not have abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea.\nFive days before this admission, the fever and headache abated; however, the achiness increased, and the patient noticed that his urine was dark yellow. Three days before this admission, the patient sought evaluation in the urgent care clinic of another hospital. Testing was negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus types A and B. He was instructed to get adequate rest and hydration. Two days before this admission, the symptoms had not abated, and the patient returned to the urgent care clinic. On examination, new yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes was observed, and he was instructed to go to the emergency department of the other hospital.\nOn evaluation, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 106/70 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The white-cell count was 17,900 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the platelet count 34,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000), and the hemoglobin level 15.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.0 to 17.0). The creatinine level was 3.0 mg per deciliter (265 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.4 mg per deciliter [53 to 124 \u03bcmol per liter]), the total bilirubin level 15.9 mg per deciliter (272 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.0 to 1.2 mg per deciliter [0 to 21 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the direct bilirubin level more than 10.0 mg per deciliter (171 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.0 to 0.5 mg per deciliter [0 to 9 \u03bcmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained.

The creatinine level increased to 3.8 mg per deciliter (336 \u03bcmol per liter), the hemoglobin level decreased to 10.3 g per deciliter, and the total bilirubin level increased to 20.9 mg per deciliter (357 \u03bcmol per liter). Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula, and boluses of intravenous fluids were given. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported exhaustion and shortness of breath but no cough, rhinorrhea, or congestion. He had no known medical conditions, took no medications, and had no known drug allergies. He lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with his partner, who had had an acute illness characterized by fever, malaise, nausea, and diarrhea that began 7 days before this admission and resolved after 4 days.\nThe patient worked in an office, and he took daily walks with his dog through the woods and along a river; he recalled receiving multiple insect bites during these walks. He reported no recent travel. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 16 years and used marijuana daily. He consumed two alcoholic drinks at a time, a few times per week, and he did not use illicit drugs.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/56 mm Hg, the pulse 103 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 42 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He was alert and oriented but appeared ill. He had increased work of breathing, with the use of accessory muscles of respiration; diffuse rales were heard in both lungs. There was no abdominal tenderness, hepatosplenomegaly, asterixis, or leg swelling. Marked scleral icterus and jaundiced skin were present, but he had no conjunctival suffusion, rash, or ulcers. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Ryan Chung: Radiography of the chest revealed bilateral, predominantly peripheral, patchy opacities (Figure 1A). Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed hyperechogenic and prominent portal triads with a \u201cstarry sky\u201d appearance; there was no biliary ductal dilatation or hydronephrosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities with tree-in-bud nodularity in both lungs (Figure 1B and 1C), as well as small pleural effusions and enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes (Figure 1D). No hepatic lesions, biliary ductal dilatation, or hepatosplenomegaly were noted (Figure 1E).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.\nDr. Crabtree: The patient started treatment with continuous positive airway pressure.

    "user_input": "Dr. Alison S. Witkin: A 21-year-old male college student was evaluated in the cardiology clinic at this hospital, before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, because of progressive dyspnea.\nWhen the patient was in his early teens, he was evaluated for intermittent exertional dyspnea and received a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma. Montelukast and an albuterol inhaler were prescribed for use as needed; however, he had not used these medications in the 2 years before the current presentation.\nSeveral months before the current presentation, the patient noticed increased dyspnea, which occurred when he was playing sports such as volleyball or walking on campus, specifically when walking at an incline or while carrying parcels. Friends had commented on his inability to \u201ckeep up\u201d during games and while walking.\nSix days before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated for dyspnea by his primary care physician at a hospital affiliated with this hospital. The heart rate was 71 beats per minute and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG), transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and chest radiograph were obtained.\nDr. David M. Dudzinski: An ECG (Figure 1A) showed right bundle-branch block and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. A TTE (Figure 1B and 1C) showed right ventricular enlargement with severe hypokinesia and hypertrophy (estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, 84 mm Hg), right atrial enlargement, flattening of the interventricular septum during systole and diastole, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and inferior vena cava dilatation.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCardiac Studies.\nDr. Anuradha S.

On examination, the heart rate was 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 130/82 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. The white-cell differential count and blood levels of calcium, amylase, lipase, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Echocardiography performed after the administration of agitated saline (a \u201cbubble study\u201d) did not reveal an atrial septal defect, but a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting was identified.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults, Other Hospital), 1 Day before Current Presentation (Other Hospital), Reference Range (Adults, This Hospital), On Current Presentation (This Hospital)\n\nB-type natriuretic peptide (pg/ml), <100.0, 61.6, \u2014, \u2014\nD-dimer (\u00b5g/ml), <0.50, 0.56, \u2014, \u2014\nTroponin I (ng/ml), <0.04, 0.03, \u2014, \u2014\nCreatine kinase (ng/ml), 32\u2013294, 172, \u2014, \u2014\nCreatine kinase MB (ng/ml), <5.1, 1.4, \u2014, \u2014\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201310, 6, \u2014, \u2014\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 16.5, 13.5\u201317.5, 16.1\nHematocrit (%), 38.0\u201350.0, 48.6, 41.0\u201353.0, 47.3\nRed-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4,320,000\u20135,720,000, 5,910,000, 4,500,000\u20135,900,000, 5,580,000\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4000\u201311,000, 5700, 4500\u201311,000, 5400\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 135,000\u2013400,000, 203,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 211,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 136\u2013145, 141, 135\u2013145, 140\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.5\u20135.2, 3.9, 3.4\u20135.0, 3.5\nChloride (mmol/liter), 99\u2013109, 108, 100\u2013108, 105\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 20\u201331, 24, 23\u201332, 21\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 9\u201323, 10, 8\u201325, 21\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.5\u20131.3, 0.9, 0.60\u20131.50, 0.95\nGlucose (mg/dl), 74\u2013106, 82, 70\u2013110, 69\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.5\u20134.8, 4.3, 3.3\u20135.0, 4.3\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201349, 48, 10\u201355, 41\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 6\u201340, 61, 10\u201340, 52\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013115, 160, 45\u2013115, 148\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.3\u20131.2, 2.1, 0.0\u20131.0, 1.6\nHIV type 1 and 2 antibodies and antigens, \u2014, \u2014, Negative, Negative\nAntinuclear antibody, \u2014, \u2014, Negative at 1:40 and 1:160, Positive at 1:40, negative at 1:80 and 1:160\nAnti\u2013Scl-70 antibody, \u2014, \u2014, Negative, Negative\nRheumatoid factor (IU/ml), \u2014, \u2014, <30, <30\n\nDr. Shenoy-Bhangle: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material and in accordance with a pulmonary embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism. However, the main pulmonary artery was dilated (diameter, 39 mm; normal value, 29 in men and 27 in women), as were segmental pulmonary artery branches. The right ventricle was enlarged. Bilateral mild, diffuse, centrilobular ground-glass nodules were noted, along with interlobular septal thickening. A 45-mm area of coarse calcification was seen in the right lobe of the liver.\nDr. Witkin: The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital with a plan for follow-up the next morning in the cardiology clinic at this hospital. At the follow-up visit, the system review was notable for snoring (reported by his roommates) and dyspnea that occurred after he ascended three flights of stairs. He had no chest pain or pressure, edema, orthopnea, dyspnea at night, light-headedness, syncope, fever, recent illness, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, change in weight, jaundice, abdominal pain or distention, change in bowel habits, nausea, anorexia, hair or nail changes, or rash.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for internal hemorrhoids with an episode of rectal bleeding, as well as a traumatic ankle sprain 3 years before the current presentation. He took no medications but had previously taken methylphenidate and atomoxetine for a learning disability characterized by inattention and difficulty with auditory processing. He took several supplements for calming and increased attention, which included the following ingredients: rhodiola extract, phosphatidylserine, melatonin, astaxanthin, and amino acids such as glutamate, glycine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, taurine, theanine, and tyrosine. He consumed protein shakes before workouts and had used creatine supplements 2 years earlier. He had received an influenza vaccine and all the routine immunizations that are required to attend school.\nThe patient was a student at a local college. During the current school year, he had been exercising at the gym three times per week, doing mostly isometric exercise and some aerobic exercise. He had never used cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, marijuana, or illicit substances. He lived with roommates, and there were no known allergic or environmental exposures in their apartment. His family history was notable for inflammatory bowel disease in his father, coronary artery disease in several paternal relatives, myocardial infarction in his maternal grandfather (when he was in his 70s), colon cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after long-term smoking in his maternal grandmother, and asthma in his maternal aunt. His two siblings were healthy.\nOn examination, the heart rate was 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg in the right arm and 122/72 mm Hg in the left arm, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was in the supine position and breathing ambient air, and the level decreased to 90% after he ascended two flights of stairs. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.6. The patient appeared to have normal development and was breathing comfortably. The sclerae were anicteric. The jugular venous pressure was 14 cm of water. A parasternal heave was detected. On auscultation, the lungs were clear, the P2 heart sound was accentuated, and a grade 3/6 early systolic murmur was present at the left sternal border. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Clubbing of the fingers and toes was present, without cyanosis.\nAn ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute, right bundle-branch block, and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. Blood levels of thyrotropin and glycated hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nAdditional tests were performed the next day. Spirometry showed normal lung volumes and a reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO; 71% of the predicted value). A bronchodilator test showed no clinically significant response to an inhaled bronchodilator. Right heart catheterization revealed a right atrial pressure of 6 mm Hg, a right ventricular pressure of 90/7 mm Hg, a pulmonary arterial pressure of 89/28 mm Hg (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 57 mm Hg), and a pulmonary arterial wedge pressure of 8 mm Hg. The central venous oxygen saturation was 67% (reference range, 60 to 70), the mixed venous oxygen saturation 71% (reference range, 65 to 75), and the arterial oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The cardiac output, measured by means of thermodilution, was 6.2 liters per minute. The pulmonary vascular resistance was approximately 8 Wood units. After the patient inhaled 30 ppm of nitric oxide, the mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 52 mm Hg and the cardiac output 6.0 liters per minute.\nA diagnosis was made.",

She also had nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. Approximately 2 weeks before the current admission, she sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. Physical examination was notable for pain with palpation of all four quadrants. The pulses were normal, and the blood pressure did not differ substantially between the two arms or between the two legs. The white-cell count was 9800 per microliter (reference range at the other hospital, 4800 to 10,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 41 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the C-reactive protein level 44.0 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 10.0).

Sutphin: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed soft-tissue density adjacent to the infrarenal abdominal aorta and mild-to-moderate associated periaortic fat stranding (Figure 1A and 1B). These findings prompted CT angiography, performed 1 hour later, which more clearly delineated infrarenal abdominal aortic wall thickening at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery, with an aortic diameter of 2.3 cm (Figure 1C).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Tanious: The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital on the same day, with a referral to the rheumatology clinic of that hospital and instructions to start treatment with prednisone. One day after discharge, one of the four culture bottles grew gram-positive bacilli, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital for investigation. After an evaluation, the positive culture was presumed to be contaminated. Additional blood specimens were obtained for culture, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day.\nThe fever and chills resolved, and the abdominal pain abated initially but then gradually worsened. Eight days after discharge and 3 days before the current admission, the patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 50 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 146/78 mm Hg. Physical examination was notable for diffuse abdominal tenderness, which was worse with deep palpation in all four quadrants. The white-cell count was 32,800 per microliter, the platelet count 565,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level 110.0 mg per liter. The urinalysis was normal; urine toxicologic screening was positive for amphetamines, cannabinoids, and opiates. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Sutphin: CT angiography revealed progression of aortic wall thickening and periaortic fat stranding and interval narrowing of the proximal segment of the inferior mesenteric artery, with an increase in the aortic diameter to 3.1 cm.\nDr. Tanious: The patient was admitted to the other hospital for a second time. Intravenous fluids, methylprednisolone, and heparin were administered, as was empirical treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam. During the next 3 days, the patient remained afebrile. Consultations with the rheumatology, infectious diseases, and vascular surgery departments were requested.\nDr. Sutphin: On the second hospital day, magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen revealed an increase in aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta (aortic diameter, 3.6 cm) with enhancement of the aortic wall. On the fourth hospital day, CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a further increase in aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta (aortic diameter, 3.9 cm) with increasing luminal irregularity and periaortic fat stranding.\nDr. Tanious: The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional treatment. On evaluation, she reported abdominal pain that was worst in the right upper quadrant and radiated to the right lower quadrant, back, and chest. She rated the pain as 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She also reported nausea but had not had fevers or chills since before the initial presentation. A review of systems was notable for the absence of fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, myalgias, joint pain, and rash; blue fingertips occurred with exposure to cold.\nDr. Sutphin: CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed evidence of continued aneurysmal enlargement and increased luminal irregularity (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F).\nDr. Tanious: The patient had a history of polycystic ovary syndrome, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder, asthma, and Chiari I malformation, which had led to suboccipital craniectomy 3 years earlier. She had undergone cesarean section 5 years earlier. Medications included prednisone, clonidine, promethazine, dicyclomine, and inhaled albuterol; latex had caused a rash. The patient was White, lived in an urban area of New England, and had recently been homeless. She had injected heroin for the past 5 years; her last injection had been 3 weeks earlier. She had a history of marijuana use and reported no methamphetamine use. Sexual history was not obtained. She drank four alcoholic beverages and smoked one pack of cigarettes daily. Her sister had rheumatoid arthritis, her grandmother had tuberculosis, and several family members had hypermobility of the joints.\nOn examination, the patient was uncomfortable because of the abdominal pain. The abdomen was soft, with diffuse tenderness that was worst in the right upper quadrant and both lower quadrants. She did not have any ulcers, rash, lymphadenopathy, or warmth, redness, or swelling of the joints; the elbows and metacarpophalangeal joints were hyperextensible. The white-cell count was 27,710 per microliter (reference range at this hospital, 4500 to 11,000), the platelet count 576,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 57 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the C-reactive protein level 60.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 8.0). Testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was negative. Serologic testing for hepatitis C virus was positive. The blood-culture isolate detected at the other hospital was identified as bacillus species, and all other blood cultures performed at the other hospital showed no growth.

Marinacci: A 72-year-old woman was evaluated for dysarthria and respiratory failure during an admission to this hospital, which had occurred before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nTwo years before the current evaluation, the patient presented to her primary care physician at this hospital with subacute exertional dyspnea, which had been present for more than a year but had progressively worsened during the past several months. The oxygen saturation was 91 to 94% while she was walking. She had edema in both legs. The white-cell count, platelet count, and blood levels of electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, and hemoglobin were normal, as were test results for kidney function.\nDr. Sandra P. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and bilateral interstitial opacities.\nDr. Marinacci: Hydrochlorothiazide was prescribed. At a follow-up evaluation 2 weeks later, the patient\u2019s weight had decreased by 5 kg, but the exertional dyspnea and bilateral leg edema were unchanged. The N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide level was normal, and the d-dimer level was 3259 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500).\nDr. Rincon: Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no pulmonary emboli. A dilated main pulmonary artery, mosaic attenuation of the lungs, and coronary-artery calcifications were present.\nDr. Marinacci: Four weeks later, the patient presented to her primary care physician with increased exertional dyspnea. Her weight had decreased by 2 kg. The peak expiratory flow was 220 liters per second (expected value according to age, sex, and height, 350). A tapering course of prednisone and inhaled albuterol were prescribed, and her condition improved initially.\nThe patient was lost to follow-up; her next visit took place 10 months before the current evaluation. At that time, the patient reported recurrent exertional dyspnea, which occurred when she moved from room to room. She reported an episode of transient facial asymmetry with saliva dripping from the left side of her mouth that had developed while she was washing herself; later that day, her sister had noticed that she was slurring words during a telephone call. The white-cell count, platelet count, and blood levels of thyrotropin, glycated hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, and hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

An examination was notable for diffuse crackles in both lung fields.\nDr. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed pulmonary edema and a small right pleural effusion.\nDr. Marinacci: Intravenous furosemide was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal biventricular wall thickness, size, and function. Mild biatrial enlargement, a patent foramen ovale with mild left-to-right shunting, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg were noted.\nOn the day before the current evaluation, the patient called her primary care physician to report sore throat with difficulty swallowing that had started 2 days earlier. Because she had slurred speech over the phone, she was referred to the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported dysphagia with food, liquids, and medications. Her daughter reported that her voice had sounded \u201cgarbled\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d during the preceding days and also during an episode of transient dysarthria that had developed a few months earlier. Dyspnea and mild leg edema had been present for at least 3 years, along with some orthopnea and an intermittent nonproductive cough. The patient had started using a walker in the past year owing to exertional fatigue, arthritic pain, and weakness in both legs. Two falls had occurred in the previous 8 months. In addition, the patient reported increased generalized weakness and limb weakness, daytime somnolence, and fatigue. She had no diplopia, numbness, dizziness, headache, chest pain, palpitations, bleeding, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for severe obesity, coronary-artery calcifications, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial flutter, and hyperparathyroidism. Medications included furosemide, apixaban, aspirin, amlodipine, lisinopril, metoprolol, lovastatin, metformin, and sertraline. She had had no known adverse drug reactions. The patient was retired and divorced, and she lived alone in an assisted-living community. She had smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 15 years but had quit smoking 20 years earlier, and she did not drink alcohol or use other substances. Her family history was notable for ischemic heart disease. Her father had had myocardial infarctions; a paternal cousin had systemic lupus erythematosus.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 76 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/88 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 124 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 53.1. The patient was appropriately oriented, and her speech was fluent. She appeared to have increased work of breathing. The oropharynx was clear; no stridor was noted. Auscultation revealed an irregular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur at the base of the left sternal border and crackles in both lungs. The patient had pitting edema in both legs with venous stasis dermatitis and had tenderness of the knees with mild crepitus but no erythema or effusion.\nThe white-cell count, platelet count, and blood levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphate, creatine kinase, lactate, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, globulin, lipase, and hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 1+ protein. Testing of an oropharyngeal swab for group A streptococcal antigen was negative, and a throat culture showed no growth.\nDr. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, low lung volumes, and bilateral interstitial opacities (Figure 1A).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Marinacci: Electrocardiography was notable for atrial flutter with a ventricular rate of 75 beats per minute, a rightward axis, and low precordial QRS voltage. On the first night in the emergency department, the patient was unable to lie flat to sleep because of dyspnea. Intravenous furosemide was administered, along with continuous positive airway pressure (with a pressure of 10 cm of water and a rate of 4 liters of oxygen per minute). Cardiology and neurology consultations were requested.\nDr. Rincon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head and CTA of the head and neck showed chronic lacunar infarcts and chronic hypertensive microangiopathy (Figure 1B). No high-grade stenosis or large-vessel occlusion was noted. CT of the neck and mediastinum showed no mass or lymphadenopathy (Figure 1C).\nDr. Marinacci: On the second day, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of slurred speech, voice changes, and dyspnea. The examination was notable for tachypnea and a new onset of forgetfulness. The dysarthria was most pronounced with guttural sounds. She also had facial droop on the right side, subtle ptosis in the right eye, slight weakness in the proximal muscles on both sides, pronator drift on the left side, and the Babinski reflex in the right foot. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Rincon: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck showed findings similar to those seen on CT. No evidence of acute infarction was noted (Figure 1D). Scattered foci of susceptibility signal were present in the cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, and thalami, findings consistent with chronic microhemorrhages. MRA showed widely patent intracranial and cervical arteries (Figure 1E and 1F).\nDr. Marinacci: On the third day, the patient was somnolent and was using accessory muscles for breathing until bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated. An evaluation revealed weak cough and delayed swallow initiation. Owing to the degree of dysphagia, it was recommended that the patient avoid oral medications and food. The thyrotropin level was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Direct laryngoscopy showed an impaired swallow, normal vocal cords, and no mass or other source of obstruction. Intravenous furosemide and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam and inhaled ipratropium were administered.\nDiagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Alba Coraini (Neurology): A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of back pain and leg stiffness.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 years before the current presentation, when stiffness in the back and upper legs developed abruptly while she attempted to rise from a seated position. She also began to have associated low back pain that worsened with bending the knees or climbing stairs. During the next several months, back and leg stiffness waxed and waned; at times, the patient could walk normally and engage in running for exercise, and at other times, she was unable to walk because her knees felt as though they had \u201clocked up.\u201d Two months after the onset of symptoms, the patient fell and broke her right arm. She perceived the fall as being unusual in that after she tripped, she was unable to prevent herself from falling because of tension in her legs. After the fall, the patient underwent physical therapy for several months, but she did not resume running for exercise because of a fear of falling.\nTwo and a half years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in a rheumatology clinic of another hospital. Passive flexion of the left knee was guarded, but the knee bent when a distraction technique was used; the remainder of the examination was normal. Hip and knee radiographs were reportedly unremarkable. The knee stiffness was not thought to be due to an underlying rheumatologic disorder.\nOne and a half years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated for knee pain in the sports medicine clinic affiliated with this hospital. The pain was localized to the anterior portions of the knees at the level of the patellae; it worsened with climbing stairs and resolved with rest. Examination and radiographs of the knees showed no abnormalities. Patellofemoral pain syndrome was diagnosed, and physical therapy was recommended. The knee pain resolved after physical therapy, but the patient continued to have leg stiffness and did not return to running owing to a fear of falling.\nThree months before the current presentation, the patient noticed ongoing lower back pain and increased stiffness in the legs that was worse in the right leg. She felt unsteady on her feet and worried about tripping while walking or falling while climbing stairs. While walking in her house, she hit her leg on a coffee table; both legs stiffened, and she fell, striking her face on the floor. There was no loss of consciousness. She was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, she had mild tenderness on palpation of the lumbar spine. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed normal paraspinal soft tissues and exaggeration of the normal lumbar lordosis, with preserved vertebral height. A loss of normal signal intensity was noted in the L4\u2013L5 intervertebral disk space on T2-weighted images, a finding that was consistent with mild degeneration. Evaluation for signal abnormality in the visible portion of the spinal cord and in the cauda equina nerve roots could not be assessed owing to severe motion artifact. There was no evidence of high-grade spinal canal or foraminal stenosis.\nDr. Coraini: Treatment with cyclobenzaprine, which was to be taken as needed at night for back pain, was initiated, and physical therapy was recommended. However, after 3 months of physical therapy, the back pain had not abated, and the leg stiffness had worsened. The patient sought evaluation in the neurology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the neurology clinic, the patient reported ongoing leg stiffness and rigidity that caused gait abnormalities. She noticed jerking movements at night as she was falling asleep. Three months before the current evaluation, she had taken lorazepam for claustrophobia before entering the MRI machine for spinal imaging, and her gait was reportedly normal for several hours after imaging.\nThe patient had a history of vitiligo, eczema, and alopecia areata. Graves\u2019 disease, for which she had been treated with methimazole, was in remission. Immune thrombocytopenia, which had been diagnosed 7 years before the current presentation, had been treated with a course of intravenous immune globulin. In addition to cyclobenzaprine, medications included cetirizine, desogestrel\u2013ethinyl estradiol, and a multivitamin. She had no known allergies. She lived in New England with her husband and had recently started a new job as an office manager. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. One sister had autoimmune thyroiditis, and another had alopecia areata.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/91 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.7. The patient appeared anxious but was in no acute distress. Strength was assessed as normal in the arms and legs. She had mildly increased tone in the legs; no fasciculations were present. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ in the arms and 3+ in the legs, with nonsustained clonus in the ankles. An exaggerated startle response was present. Sensation was normal. On ambulation, there was reduced flexion of the knees and a wide-based gait.\nBlood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of creatine kinase was 33 U per liter (reference range, 26 to 192), the C-reactive protein level 1 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 10), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 2 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Schaefer: MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1), was limited by motion artifact. No specific cord abnormality was identified. Mild degenerative changes were noted in the thoracolumbar spine, without moderate or severe narrowing of the spinal canal or neural foramina. No abnormal enhancement was seen. Possible atrophy of the posterior paraspinal musculature was detected in the lower lumbar spine. Exaggeration of the normal lumbar lordosis was noted.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Spine.\nDr. Coraini: A diagnostic test was performed.",

He reported that he had had progressive dyspnea with walking or lifting items at his job for the past year; the dyspnea had been most prominent during the 4 months before this evaluation and had been accompanied by persistent nonproductive cough. His daughter, a health care worker, called emergency medical services when she noticed that he had facial redness and flushing and learned of the swelling of his neck and arms.\nOn evaluation at the other hospital, the temperature was 35.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/57 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The face was flushed, and the neck was swollen. Breath sounds were absent in the right lung fields. The blood levels of troponin I and amylase were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults, Other Hospital), On Admission (Other Hospital), Reference Range (Adults, This Hospital), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.0\u201317.5, 11.8, 13.5\u201317.5, 12.3\nHematocrit (%), 39.0\u201353.0, 35.5, 41.0\u201353.0, 36.6\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4000\u201311,000, 10,500, 4500\u201311,000, 11,560\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 342,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 353,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 137\u2013146, 129, 135\u2013145, 132\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.6\u20135.2, 4.5, 3.4\u20135.0, 3.9\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013110, 94, 98\u2013108, 98\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 21\u201332, 29, 23\u201332, 24\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201323, 12, 8\u201325, 4\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.55\u20131.30, 0.51, 0.60\u20131.50, 0.61\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 9.3, 8.5\u201310.5, 8.3\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.2\u20135.0, 2.5, 3.3\u20135.0, \u2014\nC\u2011reactive protein (mg/dl), 0\u20130.80, 18.10, \u2014, \u2014\n\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed a new mass in the hilar region of the right upper lobe that measured 9.2 cm in greatest dimension. There was evidence of mass effect on the right main pulmonary artery and right main-stem and right upper-lobe bronchi, encasement of the right bronchus intermedius, occlusion of the superior vena cava (SVC) and narrowing of the right superior pulmonary vein, pulmonary emboli in the pulmonary artery of the left lower lobe, consolidation and atelectasis in the right upper lobe, chest-wall edema and extensive venous collateral vessels, and bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam and heparin were administered.\nThe next day, thoracentesis was performed, and 500 ml of cloudy yellow fluid was removed. On analysis of the pleural fluid, the fluid glucose level was 98 mg per deciliter (5.4 mmol per liter), the protein level 3.4 g per deciliter, the lactate dehydrogenase level 74 U per liter, and the pH 7.5. Gram\u2019s staining of the pleural fluid revealed no organisms, and no malignant cells were identified on cytologic analysis. Ultrasonography of the legs showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis. CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed no hemorrhage or stroke, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis reportedly revealed subcentimeter lucent areas in the iliac bones. The next day, the patient was transferred to the oncology unit of this hospital for further evaluation and care.\nOn admission to this hospital, the patient reported that, during the past 3 days, he had had progressive swelling of both upper arms, as well as pain in the right shoulder and arm. He noted weight loss of approximately 10 kg in the past 6 months, anorexia, hoarse voice, dizziness with changes in position (including bending forward), and dyspnea on exertion. A review of systems was negative for hemoptysis, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, changes in bowel habits, vomiting, abdominal pain, night sweats, headache, and diplopia.\nMedical history included surgery on the shoulder and leg. The patient took no medications, and there were no known adverse reactions to medications. He was self-employed and had worked in plumbing and engineering. He had smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 40 years and smoked marijuana occasionally. He drank five beers per day two times per week. His family history was notable for pancreatic cancer in his mother.\nThe temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 114/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 90 kg, the height 172 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 30.6. There was neck swelling and erythema, with no stridor. Jugular venous distention was present. On auscultation, the heart sounds were tachycardic but distant, and the lung sounds were markedly decreased on the right side. There was edema of the arms, with more pronounced swelling in the right arm than in the left arm, as well as erythema on the chest and evidence of engorged veins in the chest wall.\nThe blood level of glucose was normal, as were the results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia with premature atrial beats, borderline-low precordial lead voltage, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes.\nDr. Subba R. Digumarthy: Chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a persistent large central mass in the right upper lobe with occlusion of the right upper-lobe bronchus and collapse of the right upper lobe. There were multiple enlarged right mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes (Figure 1A). The brachiocephalic veins and the SVC showed no opacification, and the presence of extensive collateral veins in the right chest wall was consistent with venous occlusion and SVC syndrome (Figure 1B and 1C). An incidental cyst was noted in the upper pole of the left kidney. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion. There was no other evidence of cancer in the abdomen. The diagnostic possibilities included non\u2013small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer, metastasis from extrathoracic cancer, and lymphoma. Granulomatous infection and fibrosing mediastinitis were less likely in this case, given the imaging findings.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Chest.\nAngiography performed the next day confirmed that there was no opacification of the subclavian and brachiocephalic veins or the SVC and that extensive collateral veins were present in the arms. After removal of some of the clots, multiple overlapping stents were placed in the internal jugular veins, the brachiocephalic veins, and the SVC (Figure 1D and 1E and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).\nDr. Colleen M. Keyes: On the fourth hospital day, rigid bronchoscopy revealed diffusely friable mucosa and dynamic airway narrowing of the right main-stem bronchus. Much of the airway narrowing appeared to be due to extrinsic compression (Figure 2). Balloon dilation of the airway was performed but did not result in resolution of the airway narrowing; therefore, an endobronchial stent was not placed. Endobronchial ultrasonography revealed a 1.5-cm mass near the carina, and transbronchial needle aspiration was subsequently performed.\nFIGURE 2\n\nPhotograph Obtained during Bronchoscopy.\nDr. Daniel Shepherd: During fine-needle aspiration of the subcarinal mass, a rapid on-site evaluation of the specimen was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (Figure 3A and 3B) showed clusters of large epithelioid cells with anisonucleosis, irregularly contoured nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and occasional binucleated forms. There was a moderate amount of thin, delicate eosinophilic cytoplasm with occasional intracytoplasmic mucin. These findings are consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. No morphologic features of small-cell carcinoma were seen, and immunohistochemical staining for neuroendocrine markers and for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was negative.\nFIGURE 3\n\nSpecimens from Fine-Needle Aspiration.\nDr. Dudzinski: Radiation and medical oncology management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Molly Wolf (Medicine and Pediatrics): A 17-year-old boy was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital, before the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, because of chest pain, syncope, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities, and elevated blood levels of creatine kinase and troponin T.\nThe patient had been well until 5 days before this admission, when fever, nausea, diarrhea, muscle aches, and chest pain developed. The chest pain radiated to the left shoulder and was worse when he took deep breaths or was lying flat. One episode of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis occurred. On the second day of illness, the patient presented to his primary care clinic at another hospital, where a viral illness was diagnosed. An intramuscular glucocorticoid injection was administered, nebulized albuterol was prescribed, and the patient was advised to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen. During the next 3 days, fever and diarrhea resolved, but chest pain, muscle aches, and nausea persisted and were accompanied by decreased appetite and cold, pale fingers.\nOn the morning of admission, lightheadedness developed. When the patient stood to get a drink of water, he felt unsteady, his vision faded, and syncope occurred. He regained consciousness within 1 minute. Emergency medical services were called, and on arrival they found that the patient was alert and the vital signs were normal. The peripheral blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 24 mg per deciliter (1.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Thiamine and 50 ml of a 50% dextrose solution were administered intravenously, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of the other hospital.\nOn arrival at the other hospital, the patient reported pleuritic left parasternal chest pain, which he rated at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform was noted to be of low amplitude, and the oxygen saturation was difficult to obtain. The weight was 95.3 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32. The fingers were cool, with a capillary refill time of 3 to 4 seconds. Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and lactic acid were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serum toxicologic screening was negative. Chest radiography revealed a borderline enlarged cardiac silhouette. ECG and echocardiography were performed.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Other Hospital), Day of First Admission (Other Hospital), 1 Wk after First Admission (Primary Care Clinic), 6 Wk after First Admission (Primary Care Clinic), Reference Range (This Hospital), 9.5 Mo after First Admission (This Hospital)\n\nHematocrit (%), 40.0\u201354.0, 41.8, 34.5, 35.2, 41.0\u201353.0, 33.0\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 14.0\u201318.0, 14.0, 10.9, 11.3, 13.5\u201317.5, 10.9\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4000\u201311,000, 9660, 4880, 4670, 4500\u201313,000, 12,490\n\nDifferential count (%):\nNeutrophils, 54.0\u201362.0, 80.4, 70.1, \u2014, 40.0\u201362.0, 86.0\nLymphocytes, 25.0\u201333.0, 8.2, 18.0, \u2014, 27.0\u201340.0, 7.4\nMonocytes, 4.7\u201312.0, 8.5, 7.2, \u2014, 4.1\u201311.0, 5.8\nBasophils, 0.0\u20130.1, 0.3, 0.4, \u2014, 0.0\u20133.0, 0.1\nEosinophils, 0.0\u20133.0, 1.6, 3.9, \u2014, 0.8, 0.5\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 308,000, 420,000, 298,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 212,000\n\nSodium (mmol/liter), 133\u2013145, 134, 140, 139, 135\u2013145, 137\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20134.7, 3.8, 4.0, 3.9, 3.4\u20134.8, 3.3\nChloride (mmol/liter), 101\u2013111, 103, 106, 105, 100\u2013108, 105\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 22\u201332, 23, 28, 29, 23.0\u201331.9, 22.0\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.9\u201310.3, 8.8, 9.1, 9.3, 8.5\u201310.5, 8.0\nGlucose (mg/dl), 65\u201399, 79, 80, 85, 70\u2013110, 102\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 4\u201318, 22, 7, 13, 8\u201325, 19\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.3\u20131.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.60\u20131.50, 0.56\n\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201340, 94, 106, 86, 10\u201355, 37\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 15\u201341, 107, 207, 223, 10\u201340, 74\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.1\u20138.1, 8.9, 8.4, 9.9, 6.0\u20138.3, 8.7\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.1\u20134.8, 2.7, 2.6, 3.1, 3.3\u20135.0, 3.0\nCreatine kinase (U/liter), 8\u2013255, 3753, \u2014, \u2014, 60\u2013400, 3375\nCreatine kinase MB isoenzyme (ng/ml), 0.0\u20136.9, 77.2, \u2014, \u2014, 0.0\u20136.9, 92.2\nTroponin T (ng/ml), <0.03, 0.76, \u2014, \u2014, <0.03, 0.93\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201315, \u2014, 90, 69, 0\u201313, 79\nC\u2011reactive protein (mg/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, <8.0, 47.6\n\nDr. Oscar J. Benavidez: An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 100 beats per minute (Figure 1). ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were present in leads I and II and the lateral precordial leads. There was no atrial or ventricular ectopy.\nFIGURE 1\n\nElectrocardiographic Studies.\nA transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular volume and systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63%; there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal. There was no mitral valve prolapse, but mild mitral regurgitation was present. The aortic dimensions were within normal limits, and there was no pericardial effusion. Doppler imaging revealed normal systolic and diastolic velocities.\nDr. Wolf: Three hours after arrival, the patient was transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission, he reported that he had intentionally lost 45 kg of weight during the previous year. He took no medications, herbal remedies, or nutritional supplements and had no known allergies. His immunizations were reportedly current. The patient lived with his mother and younger brother. He played sports; he had no known exposure to sick persons and was not sexually active. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His mother had hypertension, unspecified heart disease, and a history of recurrent miscarriages. A brother had died at 56 days of age from sudden infant death syndrome. His maternal grandmother had hypertension and diabetes, and a maternal aunt had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with nephritis.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the pulse 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The fingers were cold and pale. Examination of the skin revealed striae on the abdomen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Tests for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.031, a pH of 6.0, and 1+ protein. Intravenous fluids, ibuprofen, and famotidine were administered, and supplemental oxygen was discontinued.\nDuring the next 24 hours, the chest pain and ECG abnormalities abated and the blood levels of creatine kinase, troponin T, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase decreased. The patient was discharged home; he was advised to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for pain, and a follow-up appointment with a pediatric cardiologist was scheduled.\nTen days later, in the cardiology clinic, the patient reported that the chest pain had resolved. He appeared well. The pulse was 86 beats per minute and the blood pressure 151/77 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Results of laboratory tests performed in the patient\u2019s primary care clinic 3 days earlier are shown in Table 1. ECG was performed.\nDr. Benavidez: An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 82 beats per minute (Figure 1). There were nonspecific ST-segment changes in leads III and aVF; ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were no longer present.\nDr. Wolf: Ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys was normal. Amlodipine was prescribed, and follow-up appointments with a pediatric nephrologist and a medical geneticist were scheduled but not kept by the patient. Results of laboratory tests performed in the primary care clinic 6 weeks after discharge are shown in Table 1.\nApproximately 9.5 months after admission to the pediatric ICU, the patient presented to the emergency department of the other hospital with a 15-hour history of fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, midsternal chest pain, and lightheadedness. He rated the chest pain at 6 out of 10. The temperature was 39.3\u00b0C, the pulse 119 beats per minute, the blood pressure 134/61 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. On examination, the capillary refill time in the fingers was 3 to 4 seconds. ECG and imaging studies were performed.\nDr. Benavidez: An ECG showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 126 beats per minute (Figure 1). There were frequent premature atrial and ventricular contractions, along with diffuse flattening of T waves.\nDr. Sjirk J. Westra: Frontal and lateral chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly, as characterized by an increased cardiothoracic ratio, with predominant enlargement of the left atrium (Figure 2). Pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial pulmonary edema and a small left pleural effusion were detected; these findings are suggestive of congestive heart failure.\nFIGURE 2\n\nChest Images Obtained 9.5 Months after First Admission.\nDr. Wolf: The patient was again transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission, he reported that the chest pain had abated. He appeared to be in no distress. The temperature was 38.8\u00b0C, the pulse 134 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/49 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg. On auscultation of the heart, the rhythm was irregular; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.027, a pH of 5.0, and 1+ protein. Intravenous fluids, magnesium sulfate, sodium phosphate, amlodipine, famotidine, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen were administered.\nDuring the next 2 days, fever and intermittent chest pain persisted and hypertension developed, with blood-pressure measurements as high as 187/97 mm Hg. Hydralazine and labetalol were administered, and the dose of amlodipine was increased. On examination, strength in the proximal muscles of the arms and legs was graded as 4 out of 5, with 5 indicating normal muscular contraction against full resistance. There were episodes during which the fingers were cold and pale; no nailfold capillary abnormalities were seen. The remainder of the examination was unchanged.\nThe blood level of troponin T decreased to 0.57 ng per milliliter and the blood level of creatine kinase MB isoenzyme decreased to 50.2 ng per milliliter, whereas the blood level of creatine kinase increased to 8336 U per liter; the urine level of myoglobin was 283 \u03bcg per liter (reference value, \u226421). The results of thyroid-function tests were normal. Some peripheral blood glucose measurements, obtained by fingerstick testing, were as low as 22 mg per deciliter (1.2 mmol per liter), despite a regular diet and the administration of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids. These values were not verified by concurrent central venous blood glucose measurements.\nAdditional test results were received, and a diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Lena G. Liu (Neurology): A 58-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of progressively worsening confusion and evolving changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 16 months before the current presentation, when confusion and expressive and auditory aphasia developed. She was evaluated at another hospital. The findings of computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck were reportedly normal. MRI of the head reportedly showed signal hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed elevated levels of glucose and protein with a normal cell count; nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus DNA was negative. Blood and CSF paraneoplastic autoantibody and autoimmune encephalopathy panels were unrevealing. The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Screening tests for syphilis and antinuclear antibodies were negative. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized slowing, with no epileptiform discharges. A diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis was considered, and treatment included intravenous glucocorticoids for 5 days, followed by treatment with daily oral prednisone. Expressive aphasia resolved and confusion abated, but auditory aphasia persisted.\nCT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a mass measuring 5 cm in diameter in the pelvis that was composed of fat, soft tissue, and calcifications. Laparotomy was performed, and pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with a mature cystic teratoma. The patient was discharged home after a 3-week hospitalization, with a plan to taper the dose of oral prednisone after discharge.\nOne week after the patient\u2019s discharge from the other hospital, after the dose of prednisone had been decreased, malaise developed and confusion recurred. The patient was readmitted to the other hospital. MRI of the head reportedly showed a decrease in the left temporal lobe hyperintensities relative to the previous imaging study. The dose of prednisone was increased, confusion again abated, and the patient was discharged home. The dose of glucocorticoids was gradually tapered.\nSix months before the current presentation, confusion recurred, and the patient was readmitted to the other hospital. Imaging studies were performed.\nDr. Otto Rapalino: MRI of the head reportedly showed progression of the signal hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe on T2-weighted FLAIR images.\nDr. Liu: A diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis was again considered. Treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids was reinitiated, which resulted in some reduction in confusion. The patient was discharged home with instructions to continue oral prednisone therapy, with a plan to again gradually taper the dose.\nThree months before the current presentation, confusion recurred. The patient was again admitted to the other hospital, and imaging studies were repeated.\nDr. Rapalino: MRI of the head reportedly showed progression of the hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe and new signal hyperintensities in the right temporal and left occipital lobes.\nDr. Liu: Treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab was initiated. The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility, with a plan for weekly rituximab infusions for 5 weeks and a 6-week tapering course of daily oral prednisone therapy. Confusion resolved and did not recur.\nDr. Rapalino: Three weeks before the current presentation, MRI of the head, which was performed to evaluate the response to immunosuppressive medications, reportedly showed hyperintensity in both temporal lobes, with extension to the anterior aspects of the parietal lobes, on T2-weighted FLAIR images. Enhancement involving the subinsular regions was present, along with restricted diffusion in the insular cortexes. Positron-emission tomography (PET)\u2013CT of the skull base to the midthighs reportedly showed no abnormalities.\nDr. Liu: Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by her neurologist in the clinic, who recommended admission to the hospital for additional treatment owing to the progressively worsening findings on head imaging. One week before the current presentation, she was admitted to the other hospital. Treatment included daily intravenous immunoglobulin for 5 days and mycophenolate mofetil. On the third hospital day, she fell and struck her forehead while walking to the bathroom. On the sixth hospital day, she was transferred to this hospital to potentially undergo a brain biopsy.\nOn arrival at this hospital, the patient reported pain on her forehead where she had struck her head during her fall. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sensorineural hearing loss (which had been diagnosed when she was 45 years of age), and depression. The results of a routine screening colonoscopy that had been performed 4 years before the current presentation had been normal. In additional to mycophenolate mofetil and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, medications included ascorbic acid, cholecalciferol, glipizide, magnesium oxide, metoprolol, omeprazole, sertraline, and thiamine. Treatment with metformin had been stopped at the other hospital because the blood level of lactate had been 12.4 mmol per liter (112 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18 mg per deciliter]) on presentation. There were no known drug allergies. She had worked in health care until the onset of neurologic symptoms 16 months earlier. Before being discharged to the skilled nursing facility, she had lived alone. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had diabetes and had died from heart disease at 59 years of age; she had used hearing aids. Her father had died from heart disease at 78 years of age. Both her brothers had diabetes, along with hearing loss in both ears.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 154/90 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 157.5 cm, the weight 34 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 13.7. Ecchymoses and a healing laceration were present on the right side of the forehead. The patient had receptive aphasia, which severely limited her ability to understand oral speech, but she could comprehend written or typed questions. She was alert and interactive and oriented to person, place, and time. Her speech was fluent, with no paraphasic errors. She was able to follow simple and complex commands without difficulty. Concentration and attention were intact. No abnormalities involving the cranial nerves were noted, with the exception of anisocoria; the left pupil measured 5 mm in diameter, and the right pupil measured 3 mm in diameter. Both pupils were reactive to light. The muscle bulk was decreased, but muscle tone and strength were normal. Tests of sensation, deep-tendon reflexes, and cerebellar function showed normal results.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests.

On presentation to the emergency department, she reported fatigue, dizziness, abdominal pain, and pain and numbness in her left lower leg. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 (on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating greater alteration of consciousness). On examination, the heart rate was 134 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute while the patient was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was notable for mild conjunctival pallor and swelling in the inferior left lower leg, which had been tied with a tourniquet. The leg was tender with ecchymosis, and two fang marks were visible on the left foot (Figure 1). The patient had diffuse pain in the lower abdomen, intermittent contractions, and vaginal bleeding. Fetal movement was detected on palpation. The fetal heart rate was 112 beats per minute; ultrasonography was not available.

Connor Johnson (Medicine): A 39-year-old woman presented to this hospital with fever, flank pain, and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 4 weeks before admission, when she noted tender bilateral inguinal swelling. Two days later, she began to have sharp, intermittent flank pain on the right side; she rated the pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. During the next 3 days, she had nausea and a poor appetite. She noted foul-smelling urine but had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or hematuria.\nThree weeks before admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, and she appeared well. There was costovertebral and abdominal tenderness on the right side, without rebound or guarding. The external genitalia were normal. Copious thin, white vaginal discharge was present; no cervical motion tenderness was noted, and the ovaries were normal on palpation. Multiple bilateral tender inguinal lymph nodes, measuring up to 2 cm in diameter, were noted on palpation. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. On microscopic examination of the vaginal discharge, clue cells were observed, but there were no fungal elements or trichomonads. Nucleic acid amplification tests of a cervical swab for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were negative. A blood test for IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies to C. trachomatis serovars L1 and D through K was negative. Urinalysis revealed leukocyte esterase and nitrates; urine was obtained for culture. Vaginal metronidazole gel was prescribed.\nTwo days later, the urine culture grew more than 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU) of Escherichia coli per milliliter and 10,000 to 100,000 CFU of Klebsiella pneumoniae per milliliter. A 14-day course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was prescribed.\nThe inguinal swelling reportedly abated, but the flank pain and nausea persisted. Two days after the patient completed the prescribed course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, fever and night sweats developed. After 3 days of fever with a temperature of up to 38.5\u00b0C, she began vomiting and subsequently presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing flank pain, malaise, nausea, and poor appetite with weight loss of 2.3 kg during the past month. There was no sore throat, cough, or diarrhea. She had a history of hypothyroidism, asthma, bipolar disorder, dysmenorrhea, and migraines. She had had multiple urinary tract infections; pyelonephritis had been diagnosed 4 years before this presentation. A copper intrauterine device had been inserted 6 months before this presentation. Medications included albuterol, budesonide\u2013formoterol, divalproex, levothyroxine, loratadine, and sumatriptan as needed for migraines. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had immigrated to the United States from Brazil 1 year earlier; she had been living in New England during the past year and had been working in a laboratory. She had recently spent 3 months in Brazil visiting her husband and had returned to New England shortly before she noted inguinal swelling. While in Brazil, she had remained in a large city and had not visited any remote locations. In New England, she lived alone with one kitten and one full-grown cat. There was no family history of cancer. An aunt had died from tuberculosis, but the patient had had only minimal contact with her aunt.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 67.5 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.4. The patient appeared ill. The right side of the abdomen was tender on palpation, without rebound or guarding. Hepatosplenomegaly was not present. Tender bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were noted. No palpable cervical, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy was noted. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative, as was an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Laboratory studies, including a complete blood count, were notable for a hemoglobin level of 4.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 11.0 to 15.0), a mean corpuscular volume of 69.7 fl (reference range, 80.0 to 100.0), and a platelet count of 922,000 per microliter (reference range, 130,000 to 400,000).\nDr. Thai: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a large cystic and solid mass in the right breast, measuring 14.9 cm by 16.2 cm by 20.0 cm (Figure 1A and 1B). Associated prominence of the intramammary, internal mammary, subpectoral, and axillary lymph nodes was observed. Heterogeneous lesions of the ribs and pulmonary nodules that could indicate metastatic disease were also noted (Figure 1C). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, provided additional evidence of ischemic stroke and showed no evidence of intracranial metastases (Figure 1D and 1E).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Shahamatdar: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Packed red cells were transfused, and a compressive bandage was applied to the breast lesion. By hospital day 2, the patient\u2019s confusion and inattention had resolved, but mild expressive aphasia persisted. Consent was obtained from the patient, and she underwent incisional biopsy of the breast lesion while under local anesthesia. The patient\u2019s hospitalization was complicated by cellulitis in the right arm at the site where a peripheral intravenous catheter had been placed, for which she was treated with intravenous antibiotic agents. She was discharged on hospital day 11 with pathological results pending, and follow-up was planned with the breast oncology clinic of this hospital.\nFour days after discharge, the patient had a sudden onset of profuse bleeding from the breast lesion, which led to hypotension, and she was again admitted to the other hospital. She received a total of 5 units of packed red cells, and bleeding was managed conservatively with sterile gauze and compressive bandaging. No further episodes of bleeding occurred. On hospital day 4, she was discharged home with plans to attend a multidisciplinary oncology evaluation at this hospital 2 days later.\nIn the breast oncology clinic, the patient reported worsening discomfort, bleeding, and drainage from the breast mass and the associated wound. She noted that progressive fatigue had developed in recent weeks but reported no fever or chills. She had first noted a palpable lesion in the right breast when she was 32 years of age, approximately 27 years before the current presentation. The patient had pursued an evaluation with breast imaging at that time, and she recollected that the lesion had been characterized as a benign finding. A biopsy had not been performed. During the intervening years, she had not pursued routine medical care, including breast imaging. She attributed the lack of medical follow-up to ongoing demands related to caring for her young child and stressors in her personal and work life. She reported that slow but steady growth of the breast lesion had occurred during those years. Approximately 2 years before the current presentation, the patient had noted more rapid growth of the lesion with progressive skin breakdown, discomfort, and drainage that she thought was related to chronic infection.\nMenarche had occurred when the patient was 10 years of age and menopause at 50 years of age. The patient had had one pregnancy, and she had used hormonal contraception for a total of 15 years during her lifetime. She had not received any hormone-replacement therapy. At the time of the current presentation, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score was 1 (assessed on a scale of 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater disability). Medications included amlodipine, atorvastatin, ferrous sulfate, and polyethylene glycol. Her family history included breast cancer in her maternal aunt. She lived in New England with her adult son and was a small-business owner. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke cigarettes.\nOn physical examination, the oral temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/81 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A large, fungating breast mass was present, which had foci of necrosis and areas of dried blood without palpable ipsilateral lymphadenopathy. Auscultation of the heart was notable for tachycardia without murmur. A neurologic examination did not reveal motor deficits, and the previously reported expressive aphasia had resolved. The patient was attentive and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The affect and mood were appropriate, and she did not report hallucinations, suicidal ideation, or symptoms of depression. She had normal insight and capacity with regard to the nature of her diagnosis and recent clinical course.\nManagement decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. George A. Alba: A 57-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of persistent cough and pulmonary opacities.\nSix years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa after fevers, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and testicular pain had developed. He was treated with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance therapy with prednisone and weekly methotrexate. He was treated intermittently with escalating doses of prednisone because of episodic worsening of the arthralgias; the most recent such treatment was given 5 months before the current admission. At that time, owing to an exacerbation of pain associated with the arthralgias and at the direction of his physician, he increased the amount of oxycodone he had been taking. He also reported fever and weight loss. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Jeanna M. Harvey Barnes: Five months before the current admission, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Chest CT (Figure 1A and 1B) revealed mild centrilobular emphysema and small pulmonary nodules that appeared unchanged from those seen on imaging that had been performed 6 years earlier. There was also diffuse thickening of the bronchial wall, layering secretions in the trachea and right main-stem bronchus, a mildly patulous esophagus, and a small hiatal hernia. There were no clinically significant findings on imaging of the abdomen or pelvis.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies of the Chest.\nDr. Alba: A test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal, as was the IgG level.\nThree months before the current admission, the patient had fevers and a cough productive of green sputum. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air. Thrush was present in the oropharynx. Auscultation of the chest revealed crackles and wheezing in the right lung. Blood levels of electrolytes, lipase, amylase, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), First Admission (3 Mo Before Current Admission), Second Admission (1 Mo Before Current Admission), Third Admission (8 Days Before Current Admission), Current Admission\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 15.4, 14.7, 12.4, 13.6\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 44.5, 46.2, 40.9, 42.8\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 20,300, 15,480, 18,120, 21,180\n\nDifferential count (%):\nNeutrophils (%), 40\u201370, 80.9, 77.5, 90.6, 83.9\nLymphocytes (%), 22\u201344, 12.3, 17.1, 5.8, 11.6\nMonocytes (%), 4\u201311, 4.8, 4.1, 3.1, 3.7\nEosinophils (%), 0\u20138, 0.4, 0.8, 0, 0.3\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 255,000, 199,000, 480,000, 406,000\nLactate (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.2, 2.8, \u2014, 2.6, 1.8\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201313, 16, \u2014, 54, \u2014\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), <8, 126.6, \u2014, 149.7, \u2014\n1,3-\u03b2-D-glucan (pg/ml), <60, 488, \u2014, 420, >500\n\nVenous blood gases:\nFraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.4\npH, 7.30\u20137.40, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 7.36\nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 38\u201350, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 64\nPartial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 35\u201350, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 26\n\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 1C) showed patchy and confluent opacities predominantly in the right mid and lower lung.\nDr. Alba: The patient was admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin was administered. A blood test for cryptococcal antigen and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and Candida albicans; a test for Pneumocystis jirovecii was negative. During the next several days, fever resolved and the oxygen saturation and white-cell count normalized. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home to complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin. After he completed the course of levofloxacin, his cough and constitutional symptoms abated partially but did not return to baseline. His primary care physician prescribed inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol and as-needed inhaled albuterol.\nSix weeks after the patient was discharged from this hospital (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission), his wife began to have a nonproductive cough and rhinorrhea; several days later, the patient had similar symptoms, along with increased production of brown sputum. He sought medical attention after awakening with coughing and dyspnea. The temperature was 38.4\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 1D) obtained 1 month before the current admission showed patchy opacities in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes.\nDr. Alba: Electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin; oral prednisone; and inhaled albuterol and ipratropium was administered. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. After two days, the patient was discharged home to complete a 7-day course of levofloxacin.\nOver the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient had malaise, productive cough, fever, and sweats. He stopped smoking cigarettes.\nEight days before the current admission, the patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. There were crackles in both lung bases and in the right middle lung field, with no wheezes. Blood levels of electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2A) showed multifocal reticulonodular and patchy opacities, which were confluent in the right lower lobe. CT of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal clustered, centrilobular nodules and opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern with scattered areas of focal consolidation that were present predominantly in the right middle and lower lobes. There was associated mild mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy that had not been present on the previous chest CT examination.\nFIGURE 2\n\nSubsequent Imaging Studies of the Chest.\nDr. Alba: The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and additional testing was performed. Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies were negative, and blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal. A urine test for legionella antigen was negative.\nOn the third hospital day, a bronchoscopy and a transbronchial biopsy were performed. The bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from the right middle lobe was cloudy; analysis of the fluid revealed 888 nucleated cells per microliter (of which 48% were neutrophils and 2% were lymphocytes, with no eosinophils). Gram\u2019s staining of the BAL fluid revealed neutrophils and sparse growth of gram-positive cocci. Staining for acid-fast organisms was negative; culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. Tests of the BAL fluid for influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, P. jirovecii, histoplasma antigen, and blastomyces antigen were negative, as were cultures for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for M. tuberculosis was also negative. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day, with follow-up scheduled in the pulmonary clinic for 3 weeks later.\nFour days after the patient was discharged, a BAL test for galactomannan returned a positive result (antigen index, \u22653.750; negative test, <0.5), and the patient was readmitted to this hospital. He reported ongoing dyspnea, cough with thick white sputum, and persistent fever with a temperature of up to 39.3\u00b0C. A review of systems was notable for diffuse chronic arthralgias, a bitter taste in the mouth, and intermittent dysphagia. There was no chest pain, edema, orthopnea, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, or rash, and he had no known current sick contacts. The weight was 5 kg lower than that recorded 1 year earlier.\nMedical history was notable for polyarteritis nodosa, deep venous thrombosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pancreatitis in the context of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, osteopenia, and chronic neuropathic pain. Medications included aspirin, prednisone, methotrexate, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, folate supplementation, metformin, atenolol, simvastatin, pregabalin, and as-needed oxycodone, as well as inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol and albuterol as needed. Lisinopril had reportedly caused pancreatic inflammation; there were no other known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was of White European ancestry. He lived in New England with his wife and was retired from an office position. Three decades earlier, he had worked in a machine shop where solvents, fuels, and sulfur compounds were used but had had no known exposure to these agents. There was no history of exposure to mold, pets, or asbestos. He had received influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. He and his wife had traveled within the United States and to the Caribbean. He had smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit in the weeks before the current admission. He had previously smoked marijuana, rarely consumed alcohol, and never used other substances. There was no family history of autoimmune or pulmonary disease; his father had died from colorectal cancer, and his mother had had esophageal cancer and had died after a stroke. His three adult children were healthy.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/69 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. He had a slightly cushingoid appearance and was tachypneic, although he was able to speak in full sentences. Auscultation of the chest revealed rales at the right lung base, rhonchi during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases that were more pronounced in the right lung than in the left lung, and intermittent inspiratory wheezing in the right lung. The rest of the examination was normal.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2D) showed progression of the diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities, with additional patchy opacities in the right lung and left lower lobe, as compared with the image obtained 1 week earlier.\nDr. Alba: Blood levels of electrolytes, amylase, lipase, N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney and liver function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal, and a urine test for legionella antigen was negative.\nThe BAL-fluid culture obtained during the previous admission grew enterococcus species, C. albicans, and C. glabrata; no mycobacteria grew in any of three induced sputum samples obtained during the previous admission. Empirical treatment with intravenous voriconazole was initiated, and ongoing treatment with methotrexate was interrupted.\nCytologic analysis of the BAL fluid and the transbronchial-biopsy specimen obtained during the previous admission revealed evidence of acute inflammation, bronchial columnar cells, and pulmonary macrophages. There were no malignant cells. Evaluation of the bronchial mucosa revealed no abnormalities.\nOn the second hospital day, the temperature was 37.9\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: Repeat CT of the chest (Figure 2E and 2F) was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary embolism protocol. This imaging study revealed extensive centrilobular pulmonary nodules, opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern, and patchy ground-glass opacities. There was bronchial wall thickening with mucus plugging, predominantly affecting the lower lobes. There were additional areas of nodular consolidation that were more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung. These findings indicated a progression of disease as compared with the chest CT performed 1 week before the current admission. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.\nDr. Alba: Additional induced sputum samples were obtained for culture; Gram\u2019s staining revealed abundant neutrophils and abundant mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.\nOn the third hospital day, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute.\nDiagnostic tests were performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Alexandra T. Lucas (Pediatrics): A 19-year-old man was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital because of shock, multiple organ failure, and rash.\nThe patient had been well until 20 hours before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed after he ate rice, chicken, and lo mein leftovers from a restaurant meal. Multiple episodes of emesis occurred, with vomitus that was either bilious or red-brown. The abdominal pain and vomiting were followed by the development of chills, generalized weakness, progressively worsening diffuse myalgias, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, neck stiffness, and blurry vision. Five hours before this admission, purplish discoloration of the skin developed, and a friend took the patient to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department of the other hospital, 4.5 hours before this admission, the patient reported diffuse myalgias that he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, he appeared pale, anxious, and moderately distressed; he answered questions appropriately and was oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, the pulse 147 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/124 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The oral mucous membranes were dry. On auscultation of the heart, tachycardia was present with a regular rhythm. The radial pulses were normal. The lungs were clear, without crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, without tenderness; the patient vomited yellow-green material during the examination. The skin was warm and dry and had a mottled appearance.\nBlood specimens were obtained and sent to the laboratory for culture, a complete blood count, and tests of renal function, liver function, and coagulation, as well as measurement of levels of electrolytes, glucose, lipase, lactic acid, and troponin. A urine specimen was sent for urinalysis and culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for influenza virus nucleic acid testing. Approximately 40 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, ondansetron, ceftriaxone, and a 2-liter bolus of 0.90% normal saline were administered intravenously.\nDuring the next 30 minutes, tachypnea worsened and labored breathing, hypoxemia, and cyanosis developed. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask, resulting in an oxygen saturation of 83%; then, oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 40 liters per minute. Intravenous doses of dexamethasone and vancomycin were given.\nDuring the following 40 minutes, the systolic blood pressure fell to 70 mm Hg and the dorsalis pedis pulses were noted to be weak. Approximately 110 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, a triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed in the right femoral vein and a continuous intravenous infusion of norepinephrine was initiated. After intravenous doses of midazolam, etomidate, and fentanyl were administered, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation with pressure-regulated volume control was begun, with a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of body weight, a rate of 24 breaths per minute, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm of water, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of 100%. A continuous infusion of propofol was begun.\nHypotension persisted, and a diffuse purpuric rash developed. Approximately 2 hours after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, a dose of piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered, a 1-liter bolus of 0.45% normal saline with 150 meq of sodium bicarbonate was given, and a Foley catheter was inserted. Twenty minutes later, a continuous intravenous infusion of phenylephrine was added, followed 7 minutes later by a vasopressin infusion. The patient was transported by helicopter to the PICU of this hospital.\nOn the patient\u2019s admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained from family members. A friend who had eaten the same meal as the patient the evening before admission had vomited once shortly thereafter but had not become progressively ill. The patient had a history of anxiety and depression, as well as intermittent ear infections during childhood. He had no known drug allergies. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. He smoked two packs of cigarettes weekly, smoked marijuana daily, and drank two alcoholic beverages approximately 2 times per week. He used dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine recreationally but did not use other illicit drugs.\nThe patient lived in northern New England with his mother, brother, and three cats but had been staying with a friend for 5 days before admission, during which time he had visited a beach along the ocean and a music venue. He worked part-time at a restaurant; he had not traveled recently or had any other exposure to animals or ill persons. His father had coronary artery disease, his mother had hypothyroidism, and his brother had had viral meningitis at 6 weeks of age.\nOn examination, the patient was pharmacologically sedated. The temperature was 40.8\u00b0C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/53 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was receiving mechanical ventilation with an Fio2 of 50%. He opened his eyes occasionally. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The femoral pulses were palpable, but the peripheral pulses were not palpable and the digits were cold. There was diffuse anasarca and oozing from venipuncture sites and from the site of central venous catheter insertion. A diffuse reticular purpuric rash was present on the face, chest, abdomen, back, arms, and legs, sparing the palms and soles (Fig. 1). A Foley catheter was in place, without urine output. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed perihilar airspace and diffuse interstitial opacities and bilateral small, layering pleural effusions.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 48.8  \nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201316.0, 16.4  \nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201313,000, 7930  \n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 4591  \nBands, 0\u20131300, 761  \nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 420  \nEosinophils, 0\u2013900, 206  \nBasophils, 0\u2013300, 71  \nMyelocytes, 0, 698  \nMetamyelocytes, 0, 1182  \n\nRed-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4,000,000\u20135,200,000, 5,380,000  \nSmear description, \u2014, Toxic granulation, D\u00f6hle bodies, vacuolated neutrophils, burr cells  \n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 12,000  \nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201320, 2  \nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 69.9  \nProthrombin-time international normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 7.9  \nActivated partial-thromboplastin time (sec), 22.0\u201336.0, >150.0  \nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 152  \nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 3.4  \nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 107  \nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 25  \nAnion gap (mmol/liter), 3\u201317, 20  \nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 6.1  \nPhosphorus (mg/dl), 2.6\u20134.5, 2.7  \nMagnesium (mg/dl), 1.7\u20132.4, 1.1  \nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 15  \nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 2.31  \nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 82  \n\nProtein (g/dl):\nTotal, 6.0\u20138.3, 2.7  \nAlbumin, 3.3\u20135.0, 1.6  \nGlobulin, 1.9\u20134.1, 1.1  \n\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201332, 31  \nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201333, 14  \nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 30\u2013100, 120  \n\nBilirubin (mg/dl):\nTotal, 0.0\u20131.0, 2.5  \nDirect, 0.0\u20130.4, 2.2  \n\nLactic acid (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.0, 9.4  \nD-dimer (ng/ml), <500, >10,000  \nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), <8.0, 81.4  \nFibrinogen (mg/dl), 150\u2013400, <60  \nAntithrombin III activity (%), 80\u2013130, 28  \nProtein C activity (%), 70\u2013150, 5  \nProtein S activity (%), 70\u2013150, 25  \nLupus anticoagulant screen, Negative, Positive  \n\nVenous blood gases:\nFraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, 0.60  \npH, 7.30\u20137.40, 7.17  \nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 38\u201350, 74  \nPartial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 35\u201350, <28  \nBase excess (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u20134.7  \n\nDr. Manuella Lahoud-Rahme: A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained while the patient was receiving norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vasopressin.

    "user_input": "Dr. David P. Bullis (Behavioral Medicine, Newton\u2013Wellesley Hospital, Newton, MA): A 54-year-old man was evaluated by the neuropsychology service of this hospital because of irritability, confusion, and odd behaviors.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before the current evaluation, when he received a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue that had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. He underwent surgical dissection of the neck and resection of the tongue base on the right side, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy, which resulted in cancer remission. After treatment, neck pain and shoulder weakness developed and was attributed to postoperative neuropathy involving the right spinal accessory nerve.\nIn the context of this illness and persistent pain, the patient sought care at the cancer center behavioral medicine clinic of this hospital and received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. During the next 8 months, the patient was seen for psychotherapy approximately every 2 weeks. Treatment for the pain included physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, trigger-point injections, and the use of a scapular elevation brace. Therapy with oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin, tizanidine, and duloxetine was started. Four months before the current evaluation, a sural nerve graft was placed in the right spinal accessory nerve from the proximal, functioning portion to the distal portion, but the pain and weakness did not abate.\nSix weeks before the current evaluation, the patient did not respond to telephone calls for 24 hours. The police were called and found the patient unresponsive with prescription medication bottles nearby. Emergency medical services personnel arrived, and the initial evaluation, in the patient\u2019s home, was notable for a severely decreased respiratory rate. Naloxone was administered, the trachea was intubated, and the patient was taken to a local hospital. In the emergency department, the patient was pulseless with ongoing electrocardiographic activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and epinephrine was administered; after 4 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The dose of methadone was decreased, and therapy with oxycodone, gabapentin, and tizanidine was stopped. During the subsequent 6 days, septic shock, aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and delirium occurred. When these problems resolved, the patient was discharged home.\nFive weeks before the current evaluation, the patient participated in a video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic. He expressed embarrassment and frustration related to his apparent accidental overdose. He described persistent depression, increased anxiety, and no other new symptoms.\nTwo weeks before the current evaluation, the patient missed a routine video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic, and his family was called. For the preceding 2 weeks, they had noticed that the patient was uncharacteristically agitated, irritable, talking loudly, and verbally abusive. Odd behaviors were reported. The patient had gotten lost while driving to a friend\u2019s house that he visited frequently, had been pulled over by police for driving erratically (with normal results on a breathalyzer test), and on another occasion, had been found walking along the highway under an overpass. He called family members repeatedly in the middle of the night, and he would not answer when the calls were returned. When the family requested a police wellness check of the patient, the patient retaliated by requesting a police wellness check of the family members. After this incident, the family was advised to take the patient to a local hospital for admission.\nAt the local hospital, the patient reported no symptoms and noted that he had stopped taking methadone because he was concerned about a medication overdose. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 19, indicating cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.1 Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nonspecific hypodensity in the centrum semiovale on the left side. The patient was told he had mild dementia. Visiting nurse services were arranged, and the patient was discharged home.\nOne week before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s family reported that he had increased confusion and odd behaviors. He was unable to recall details of conversations that had happened minutes before. He could not operate the telephone or remote control and had emptied the trash can into the toilet. He had asked for his clothes to be cut off because he felt uncomfortable. Family members had been staying with the patient every night since his recent discharge because they were concerned about his safety. A neuropsychological evaluation was requested.\nDr. Michael W. Parsons: The evaluation was conducted by the cancer center neuropsychology service of this hospital with the use of videoconferencing technology to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient acknowledged only minimal cognitive changes and was dismissive of the family\u2019s concerns. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, moderate depression, mild anxiety, and difficulty sleeping and keeping track of time.\nAdditional history obtained from the patient\u2019s family included insomnia, lumbar disk herniation, olecranon bursitis, and an inguinal hernia that had led to surgical repair in early adulthood. He had had multiple concussions as a teenager, as well as a brief loss of consciousness during a motor vehicle collision 3 years earlier. After the collision, fatigue, headaches, difficulty concentrating, and impaired memory occurred; during the subsequent 2 years, occupational therapy was provided, and the symptoms gradually resolved.\nMedications at the time of evaluation included ibuprofen, acetaminophen, duloxetine, trazodone, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and multivitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England with family members nearby. He had completed a master\u2019s degree and had had a successful career; he had taken a leave of absence from work 9 months earlier in anticipation of cancer treatment. After cancer treatment, he had been unable to return to work because of pain. He was athletic, walked 3 miles daily, and enjoyed golfing. He rarely drank alcohol and had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs. His family history included breast cancer and dementia in his mother, hearing loss and hypertension in his father, metastatic cancer with an unknown primary source in his paternal grandfather, glaucoma and alcohol use disorder in his maternal grandmother, and a brain tumor in a more distant relative.\nOn video neuropsychological examination, the patient was in no distress and was adequately groomed, with normal-appearing hygiene. His affect was irritable, and the fact that he reported no symptoms suggested limited insight. His spontaneous speech was fluent and well articulated. His thoughts were tangential, and he was frequently forgetful and easily distracted; his information processing speed was slow. A formal neuropsychological assessment revealed impaired executive functioning, marked by disinhibition and poor working memory, as well as deficits in recent memory, verbal fluency, and information processing speed.\nDr. Bullis: A diagnostic test was performed.",

Erdil (Medicine): A 58-year-old woman was evaluated in the infectious disease clinic of this hospital because of fatigue, abdominal bloating, and eosinophilia.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 8 months before the current evaluation, when she fell and injured her right leg while hiking in a rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Before this injury, she had been traveling throughout the DRC for 1 month. She had hiked, walked barefoot, and gone swimming in freshwater lakes and rivers.\nApproximately 55 hours after the fall, the patient was transported to the trauma center of a regional hospital. Imaging studies revealed fractures of the right tibia with associated hemorrhage. Packed red cells were transfused, and an external fixation device was placed. Once the patient\u2019s condition was stable, she was transferred to a hospital in the United States.\nAt the second hospital, the eosinophil count was 3530 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 400); the eosinophil count had been normal 18 months earlier. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. One week after the fall, open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture was performed.

She had associated these symptoms with the onset of menopause. However, after the traumatic leg injury, she noticed that the symptoms increased in severity. One month before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s weight had increased by 8.6 kg since the leg injury, and she took a 1-hour nap every afternoon because of fatigue. In addition, she had new abdominal bloating that did not abate with the use of probiotics. The patient sought evaluation at a clinic associated with the second hospital. On evaluation, the results of blood tests for thyroid, kidney, and liver function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes. A test for Lyme disease was negative. The results of testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)\u2013specific antibodies and other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nTwo weeks before the current evaluation, the patient moved to New England and established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. She continued to receive physical therapy for rehabilitation of the right leg. She reported that the weight gain, fatigue, and abdominal bloating had worsened at a rapid rate; her weight had increased by 13.6 kg since the leg injury. The patient was referred to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital.\nThe patient had a history of chronic migraines and hyperlipidemia. Review of systems was notable for mild cough and swelling of the right knee that began after the surgery. She had no fever, hot flashes, night sweats, headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myalgias, arthralgias, or rash.\nCurrent medications included levothyroxine and probiotics. There were no known allergies. The patient had previously traveled to the southwestern United States, North and East Africa, western Europe, and South and Southeast Asia. She currently lived in a suburban area of New England with her husband and cats in a house that had mold. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 98/66 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.9. She appeared well. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the abdomen was soft and nontender; there was no hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The right knee and leg had healed surgical scars. The skin examination was normal.\nThe eosinophil count was 1760 per microliter. Tests for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and strongyloidiasis were negative. The urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Vincent V. Dinculescu: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed calcified, nonenlarged subcarinal lymph nodes, along with calcified lesions in the right lung, liver, and spleen, findings suggestive of granulomatous disease. There was also a low-attenuation hepatic lesion measuring 1.6 cm in diameter, which was probably a cyst.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Chest and Abdomen.\nDr. Erdil: A diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Daniele Lerner (Pediatrics): An 18-year-old man with the Dravet syndrome was admitted to this hospital because of fever and increased frequency of seizures.\nThe Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes the sodium channel \u03b11 subunit (SCN1A), had been diagnosed during evaluation for intractable seizures that had begun when the patient was 6 months of age. He had had developmental delay, was nonverbal, and required supervision while walking because of a slow, shuffling gait with associated falls.\nThe patient was in his usual state of health until 2 months before this admission, when his parents noticed swelling of the left foot after a fall. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital, and radiography of the left foot was reportedly normal.\nTwo weeks before this admission, swelling of the left foot increased. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician, and additional imaging of the foot was recommended. The patient was already scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (which was planned to be performed with the patient under general anesthesia) as part of a research study for patients with the Dravet syndrome.1 MRI of the left foot was performed at the same time.\nDr. Teresa Victoria: MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse cerebral volume loss. There were incidental secretions filling the sphenoid and frontal sinuses that had heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted images and hyperintense signal intensity on T1-weighted images; mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses was also noted. MRI of the left foot, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal bone marrow edema in the midfoot and hindfoot. There was no fracture, dislocation, or joint effusion.\nDr. Lerner: Treatment with amoxicillin was initiated by the patient\u2019s primary care physician to treat possible sinusitis. Seven days before this admission, the patient\u2019s parents noticed increased swelling and new warmth of the left foot, and the patient appeared uncomfortable when bearing weight on that foot. The oral temperature measured at home was 38.3\u00b0C. Five days before this admission, bruising of the left foot developed, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient was afebrile and appeared well. There was swelling, bruising, and tenderness of the left foot. The white-cell count was 5870 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the hemoglobin level 11.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the blood level of C-reactive protein (CRP) 23.9 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

During the next 5 days, his parents noticed that he was less interactive than usual. He had intermittent diaphoresis and tachycardia, and the frequency of seizures had increased from one every 2 to 3 days to two or three seizures daily. One day before this admission, the oral temperature measured at home was 38.1\u00b0C. After a telephone consultation with the patient\u2019s primary care physician, treatment with amoxicillin was changed to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate. The seizure frequency did not decrease, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nAdditional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. They had not observed nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or cough. The patient had gingivitis that had recently worsened; during the 2 weeks before this admission, there had been new bleeding from the gums and bleeding from the nose. The patient was following a ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment for seizures; because of multiple food allergies, the ketogenic formula was administered through a gastrostomy tube. He had loose stools, which the parents attributed to tube feeding; the stools were unchanged in volume and frequency. He had had two episodes of nonbilious, nonbloody emesis during the week before this admission.\nThe patient\u2019s parents also reported that 7 months before this admission, the patient had begun to have fever, vomiting, and increased volume and frequency of stools; coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was diagnosed, and the volume of the ketogenic formula was decreased by half for 4 days until vomiting resolved. Medications included amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, cannabidiol, clobazam, famotidine, glycopyrrolate, levocarnitine, levocetirizine, a multivitamin, potassium citrate, and phosphorus, as well as lorazepam as needed for seizures lasting longer than several minutes. He had no known drug allergies. He lived with his father and two cats in an urban area of New England; he occasionally stayed with his mother in a rural area of New England.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the blood pressure 124/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.8. The patient appeared tired and flushed but was alert and interactive. There was low muscular bulk and tone. The gingivae were erythematous and bleeding (Figure 2), and several dental caries were seen. There was no sinus tenderness or discharge. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the heart sounds were normal. The abdomen was nontender, and the insertion site of the gastrostomy tube was not erythematous or indurated. The walking cast was removed; there was edema and bruising of the left foot (Figure 2).\nFIGURE 2\n\nClinical Photographs.\nThe results of tests of liver function and kidney function were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes and glucose. Urinalysis was normal; there were 2+ ketones (reference value, negative; however, 2+ is considered to be a normal value for patients following a therapeutic ketogenic diet). The blood level of CRP had increased to 74.0 mg per liter; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was negative. Stool testing for Clostridium difficile antigen and toxin was negative, as was a stool examination for ova and parasites. Specimens of blood and stool were sent for culture. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest revealed a patchy opacity in the right lung base. Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed diffuse bone demineralization and fractures of the second metatarsal and cuboid, findings that were similar to those seen on previous imaging. There was sclerosis in the proximal first and distal fourth and fifth metatarsals that was suggestive of new fractures. A crescentic osseous fragment was thought to be an avulsed fragment of bone.\nDr. Lerner: A diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made, treatment with intravenous fluids and ampicillin\u2013sulbactam was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 7 days, he had no fever, but tachycardia persisted. Blood cultures showed no growth, and stool cultures showed normal intestinal flora. The CRP level had increased to 108.1 mg per liter, the d-dimer level was 6953 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500), and the hemoglobin level had decreased to 7.0 g per deciliter. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Victoria: Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed multiple new areas of cortical erosions, including the medial base of the first metatarsal and the medial navicular bone. MRI of the left tibia, fibula, and foot (Figure 3), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed worsening bone edema in the left foot; foci of bone edema were also seen in the proximal tibia and fibula. Multiple fractures that had been seen on previous imaging of the left foot were noted, and there were intraosseous cystic hemorrhagic foci within the calcaneal, cuboid, and second metatarsal fractures.\nFIGURE 3\n\nMRI of the Left Foot.\nDr. Lerner: On hospital day 8, the temporal temperature was 38.0\u00b0C.

Manzano (Neurology): A 64-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital with cognitive impairment, headache, and memory loss.\nThe patient had been well until 6 weeks before admission, when respiratory symptoms developed. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. At around the same time, coworkers observed a decline in the patient\u2019s performance at work. The patient noticed that she was having difficulty operating computers and was forgetting her personal passwords.\nThe patient was evaluated at another hospital. Although she reported recent confusion and changes in cognitive performance, the examination at that time \u2014 including a neurologic examination with assessment of orientation, speech, and memory recall after 5 and 20 minutes \u2014 was unremarkable. The patient was referred for an outpatient neurologic evaluation.\nOne week later (5 weeks before admission), severe headache developed suddenly, along with blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea. After the administration of ondansetron, the blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea resolved; after the administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the headache became less severe, with mild pain and intermittent episodes of more severe pain.\nThree weeks before admission, the patient was seen in a neurology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She had difficulty recalling the history of her symptoms. On examination, she was oriented to place and person only and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations or to spell \u201cworld\u201d backward. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The complete blood count with differential count and test results for liver and kidney function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, thiamine, and cobalamin.

Cultures of the CSF were negative. The administration of topiramate was stopped; treatment with oral doxycycline was started but then was stopped after 5 days, when results of a test for Borrelia burgdorferi were interpreted as negative.\nOver the next 3 weeks, intermittent headache persisted and cognitive impairment worsened. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital. She was unable to provide a history. According to the patient\u2019s husband, the patient had stopped working and was no longer able to effectively care for herself, requiring assistance with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, and eating. She had difficulty planning and was unable to put on clothes in the correct sequence or to turn on the shower. Memory impairment persisted, conversation was tangential, and visual hallucinations frequently occurred. The patient had lost 6.8 kg in the past month. There was no fever, rash, or joint pain.\nThe patient had a history of poliomyelitis in childhood, with residual mild weakness in the left leg; vitamin B12 deficiency, which had been corrected; and hypothyroidism. Medications included atorvastatin, levothyroxine, sertraline, vitamin B12, and cholecalciferol. She had a known allergy to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate with an unknown reaction. She was a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history, and she had consumed four alcoholic beverages per week before the onset of the current illness. The patient worked in a health care clinic and lived with her husband in a suburban area of New England. She had not traveled outside the United States. She was an avid gardener; she had a dog but no other animal exposures. Her father had received a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease at 62 years of age.\nOn examination, the patient was alert and interactive. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 105/51 mm Hg, the heart rate 56 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.4. The patient was oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was fluent, with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. She had impaired abstraction and mildly impaired attention. She was unable to recall three objects after a delay. Intermittently during the examination, she had visual hallucinations that she knew were not real. Cranial nerve examination was unremarkable. Strength was 5/5 throughout, except in the left leg (4/5). Reflexes were brisk throughout, including 3+ reflexes in the arms and the right lower leg; pectoralis reflexes and a jaw jerk were present. No ankle clonus was noted. Examinations for tone, sensation, and cerebellar function were unremarkable. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Gonzalez: MRI of the head was performed (Figure 1). FLAIR images showed slight progression of the diffuse subarachnoid hyperintensities and leptomeningeal enhancement. Susceptibility-weighted images showed frontal superficial siderosis and scattered lobar microhemorrhages. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head revealed patent cranial vessels, without evidence of aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or thrombosis. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Manzano: Lumbar puncture was performed. On CSF analysis, the nucleated-cell count was 28 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), the lymphocyte count 85%, the red-cell count 53 per microliter, and the protein level 280 mg per deciliter. CSF was sent for culture and cytologic studies; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An EEG was normal.\nThe patient was admitted to this hospital, and intravenous ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and methylprednisolone were administered. During the first 48 hours, the patient was agitated and impulsive. Visual hallucinations worsened, and olanzapine was administered. The CSF culture was negative, and the CSF cytologic studies showed no malignant cells.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. W.K. Claudia Wu: A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital of the Chinese University of Hong Kong because of abdominal pain and diarrhea.\nThe patient had been well until 6 months before this admission, when colicky, diffuse abdominal pain developed. She also had nonbloody diarrhea that occurred up to 10 times daily. During the subsequent 6 months, the patient noticed decreased appetite and weight loss of 5 kg. The symptoms did not abate, and her family encouraged her to seek medical evaluation.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported gradually darkening skin on the face, arms, and legs, as well as hair thinning and changes in the appearance of all the fingernails and toenails during the previous 4 months. There was no nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, hematochezia, fevers, or night sweats.\nThe patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Ten months before this admission, she had sought evaluation by a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner because of irregular menses. She was given a \u201chomemade\u201d traditional Chinese medicine that contained unknown ingredients. The patient took the remedy for 4 months and stopped taking it when the abdominal pain and diarrhea developed 6 months before this admission. She did not take other medications and had no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband and son in an urban area of Hong Kong, and she did not work outside the home. She did not vape or smoke cigarettes, and she did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother and father were healthy; there was no family history of gastroenterologic, autoimmune, or hereditary diseases.\nOn evaluation, the temporal temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg, and the heart rate 85 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20. Examinations of the thyroid, heart, and lungs were normal. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Moderate pitting edema was observed in the lower legs, up to the mid-calf.\nDr. W.S. Agnes Chan: On dermatologic examination, the patient had patchy hair loss, with a large patch of alopecia at the vertex of the scalp; there was no scarring of the scalp (Figure 1A). A hair-pull test (in which 40 to 60 strands of closely grouped hair are gently pulled, with more than 10% of hairs pulled out indicating a positive result) was negative. There were symmetric brown macules over the lateral lower cheeks and malar regions of the face (Figure 1B and 1C), and hyperpigmentation and diffuse brown-gray macules were observed over the palms and the palmar aspects of the fingers (Figure 1D and 1E). Onychodystrophy was present on all the fingernails (Figure 1E) and toenails. There was onycholysis with distal separation of the nail plates from the nail beds, thinned nail plates, distal nail-plate crumbling, and onychomadesis with proximal separation of the nail plates from the nail matrices (Figure 1E and 1F).\nFIGURE 1\n\nPhotographs of the Scalp and Skin.\nDr. Wu: The blood level of hemoglobin was 10.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 11.9 to 15.1) with a low mean corpuscular volume.

    "user_input": "Dr. Christine M. Parsons (Medicine): A 75-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of arthritis, abdominal pain, edema, malaise, and fever.\nThree weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed waxing and waning \u201cthrobbing\u201d pain in the right upper abdomen, which she rated at 9 (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain) at its maximal intensity. The pain was associated with nausea and fever with a temperature of up to 39.0\u00b0C. Pain worsened after food consumption and was relieved with acetaminophen. During the 3 weeks before the current admission, edema developed in both legs; it had started at the ankles and gradually progressed upward to the hips. When the edema began to affect her ambulation, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems that was obtained from the patient and her family was notable for intermittent fever, abdominal bloating, anorexia, and fatigue that had progressed during the previous 3 weeks. The patient reported new orthopnea and nonproductive cough. Approximately 4 weeks earlier, she had had diarrhea for several days. During the 6 weeks before the current admission, the patient had lost 9 kg unintentionally; she also had had pain in the wrists and hands, 3 days of burning and dryness of the eyes, and diffuse myalgias. She had not had night sweats, dry mouth, jaw claudication, vision changes, urinary symptoms, or oral, nasal, or genital ulcers.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for multiple myeloma (for which treatment with thalidomide and melphalan had been initiated 2 years earlier and was stopped approximately 1 year before the current admission); hypothyroidism; chikungunya virus infection (diagnosed 7 years earlier); seropositive erosive rheumatoid arthritis affecting the hands, wrists, elbows, and shoulders (diagnosed 3 years earlier); vitiligo; and osteoarthritis of the right hip, for which she had undergone arthroplasty. Evidence of gastritis was reportedly seen on endoscopy that had been performed 6 months earlier. Medications included daily treatment with levothyroxine and acetaminophen and pipazethate hydrochloride as needed for cough. The patient consumed chamomile and horsetail herbal teas. She had no known allergies to medications, but she had been advised not to take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs after her diagnosis of multiple myeloma.\nApproximately 5 months before the current admission, the patient had emigrated from Central America. She lived with her daughter and grandchildren in an urban area of New England. She had previously worked in health care. She had no history of alcohol, tobacco, or other substance use. There was no family history of cancer or autoimmune, renal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, or cardiac disease.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 152/67 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She had a frail appearance and bitemporal cachexia. The weight was 41 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 15.2. Her dentition was poor; most of the teeth were missing, caries were present in the remaining teeth, and the mucous membranes were dry. She had abdominal tenderness on the right side and mild abdominal distention, without organomegaly or guarding. Bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy was palpable. Infrequent inspiratory wheezing was noted.\nThe patient had swan-neck deformity, boutonni\u00e8re deformity, ulnar deviation, and distal hyperextensibility of the thumbs (Fig. 1). Subcutaneous nodules were observed on the proximal interphalangeal joints of the second and third fingers of the right hand and on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger of the left hand. Synovial thickening of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the second fingers was noted. There was mild swelling and tenderness of the wrists. She had pain with flexion of the shoulders and right hip, and there was subtle swelling of the shoulders and right knee. Pitting edema (3+) and vitiligo were noted on the legs. No sclerodactyly, digital pitting, telangiectasias, appreciable calcinosis, nodules, nail changes (including pitting), or tophi were present. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nFIGURE 1\n\nPhotograph of the Hands.\nThe blood levels of glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, globulin, lactate, lipase, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal, as were the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 3+ protein and 3+ blood, and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field and granular casts. Urine and blood were obtained for culture.

    "user_input": "Dr. Marisa L. Winkler: A 22-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of pain and rapidly spreading erythema of the left hand.\nThe patient had been well until the day of admission, when he awoke with pain and swelling of the left hand that involved the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger. Over a period of several hours, the pain progressed and bullae began to form. He began to have pain with movement of the second and fourth fingers, and the bullae turned dark purple; these changes prompted the patient to present to the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported pain of the left hand that worsened with movement of the second and fourth fingers. There was no lethargy, fatigue, headache, dyspnea, cough, or pain elsewhere. The patient had no notable medical history and had been well before the day of presentation.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There were two violaceous, tender bullae on the dorsal aspect of the left hand \u2014 one on the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and one on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger, each measuring 7 mm by 3 mm (Figure 1). In addition, there was nontender, streaking erythema spreading across the dorsal aspect of the left hand, the volar aspect of the left forearm, and the medial aspect of the left upper arm into the axilla. There was no axillary lymphadenopathy.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs.\nOn further examination of the left arm, the soft-tissue compartments were soft and compressible, without evidence of crepitus. Finger flexion and extension were intact but limited by pain and swelling in the second and fourth fingers. Results of motor and sensory examinations were normal. The hand was warm. The radial pulse was palpable, and the capillary refill was brisk. The remainder of the overall physical examination was unremarkable.

There was no evidence of osseous erosion, periosteal reaction, fracture, joint effusion, fluid collection, or subcutaneous air. The left forearm had a normal appearance on imaging.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Winkler: While the patient was in the emergency department, additional history was obtained. The patient was not taking any medications and had no known allergies to medications. He had recently graduated from college and was seeking employment. He lived with his parents in a suburban area of New England. There was no history of recent travel or sick contacts. He rarely drank alcohol and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. There was no notable family history.\nThe patient had recently begun practicing taxidermy as a new hobby. Four days before presentation, he received a frozen deer hide from a friend, which he began to prepare for tanning. When he first received the deer hide, he scraped the skin and fur to remove numerous ticks. On the day before presentation, he kneaded the hide with his hands and massaged into it a mixture of deer brain and tap water that had been prepared the day before and left to stand overnight. While the patient was working with the animal hide, he did not wear protective clothing or gloves. His mother had assisted in part of the process but remained well.\nIntravenous fluid, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Consultants from the orthopedic hand service, dermatology, and infectious diseases evaluated the patient. A diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Daryl J. Selen: A 29-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent bone fractures and hypophosphatemia.\nThe patient had been well until 19 months before admission, when pain in the right midfoot developed during a vacation in Europe. On her return to the United States, she was evaluated by her primary care physician at a clinic affiliated with another hospital; an orthotic device was recommended, but the foot pain did not decrease with use of the device.\nThree months later, the pain in the right foot increased in severity after a second vacation in Europe. Radiography of the right foot reportedly revealed no fracture; physical therapy was recommended. During the subsequent 8 months, the pain continued to gradually increase in severity, was worse when the patient stood upright or walked, and was relieved with the administration of ibuprofen.\nEight months before admission, the patient tripped, and the severity of pain in the right foot increased suddenly. She was evaluated in the orthopedic clinic of this hospital. On examination, the height was 173 cm, the weight 115 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 38.6. There was tenderness over the right third metatarsal. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Rene Balza: Radiography of the right foot (Figure 1A) revealed a fracture of the third metatarsal shaft. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right foot revealed a nondisplaced, incompletely healed transverse fracture of the third metatarsal shaft, as well as subchondral sclerosis and bone marrow edema within the distal navicular bone and in the calcaneocuboid joint. Bone stimulation was recommended, but the patient\u2019s pain did not abate after these treatments.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies of the Foot and Sacrum.\nDr. Selen: Seven months before admission, the patient had increased pain in the right foot after a fall while walking on ice. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Balza: Radiography of the right foot (Figure 1B) revealed fractures of the distal fourth and fifth metatarsals.\nDr. Selen: Five months before admission, the second metatarsal region of the right foot was tender on palpation after the patient had walked up a flight of stairs. However, no evidence of a fracture was seen on radiography.\nFour months before admission, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. The calcium level was 9.5 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level 26 ng per milliliter (65 nmol per liter; reference range, 20 to 80 ng per deciliter [50 to 200 nmol per liter]), and the parathyroid hormone level 45 pg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 60); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, performed for the assessment of bone mineral density, revealed normal bone mass in the lumbar spine (z score, 0.0; reference range, 1.9 to \u22121.9) and in the femoral neck (z score, 0.4; reference range, 1.9 to \u22121.9). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation and weight loss were recommended.

A controlled ankle motion walking boot and crutches were recommended for ambulation.\nDr. Selen: During the next 3 months, the pain in the right foot persisted, and new pain developed in the left foot. The patient was seen in the pain medicine and podiatry clinics affiliated with the other hospital. Diagnoses of plantar fasciitis, Achilles\u2019 tendinitis, and sinus tarsi syndrome were considered. Treatment with methylprednisolone and celecoxib was initiated, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital.\nOn evaluation in the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported bilateral foot and ankle pain and swelling that was greater in the right foot and ankle than in the left, as well as stiffness and warmth in the ankles. There was lower back pain and bilateral hip pain, which was greater on the right side than on the left side. The patient reported that the back and hip pain had been present since she was a teenager but had gradually increased in severity during the previous year. Fatigue and generalized weakness had developed and worsened during the previous month. There was no fever, weight loss, or change in diet.\nMenarche had occurred when the patient was 11 years of age, and menstrual cycles had been regular since then. There was a history of fractures of the left wrist in childhood. Other medical history included obesity, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, nephrolithiasis, biliary dyskinesia (which had led to cholecystectomy 1 year before this admission), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosed on the basis of a liver biopsy. Medications included celecoxib, ergocalciferol, citalopram, and lorazepam; she had no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England and had previously worked as a nurse; however, she was unable to work during the previous 8 months because of pain and difficulty with ambulation. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had osteopenia; her mother, father, and sister had psoriasis; her father had psoriatic arthritis; and her brother had the Williams syndrome, a rare genetic and developmental disorder.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 121/78, and the heart rate 94 beats per minute. Dentition was normal, and the gait was antalgic. Proximal muscle strength was intact in both arms (5/5) and slightly reduced in the legs (4/5). There was tenderness over the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints that was more pronounced on the right side than on the left side. The FABER test \u2014 in which the leg is flexed and the thigh is abducted and externally rotated \u2014 elicited pain in both hips. There was tenderness over the right midfoot and warmth and swelling of the ankles. No musculoskeletal deformities, bowing of the legs, lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, or rashes were noted. The blood level of phosphorus was 1.0 mg per deciliter (0.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter]); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was instructed to go to the emergency department of this hospital. Intravenous sodium phosphate and oral potassium phosphate were administered. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Balza: Radiography of the lumbar spine, pelvis, hips, and ankles revealed anterolisthesis of L4 and L5 with a defect in the pars interarticularis; there were no fractures. On radiography of the right foot, a fracture in the third metatarsal was initially identified 8 months before admission (Figure 1A), followed by the development of fractures in the fourth and fifth metatarsals 1 month later (Figure 1B). Subsequently, T2-weighted MRI of the sacrum with fat suppression performed on admission (Figure 1E and 1F) revealed vertically oriented hypointense bands in the bilateral sacral alae and a horizontally oriented hypointense band in S2, as well as bone marrow edema adjacent to the fracture lines; the combination of these findings was consistent with an H-shaped sacral insufficiency fracture.\nDr. Selen: The patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.",

Diacovo (Pediatrics): An 11-year-old girl was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of redness of the eyes.\nThe patient had been well until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when she noticed mild eye redness, which was worse in the right eye than in the left eye. There was intermittent swelling of the eyelids but no photophobia, itching, pain, tearing, or discharge. The patient\u2019s parents administered naphazoline hydrochloride and glycerin eye drops, but the eye redness did not abate. When the eye redness had persisted for 2 weeks, the patient was taken to the pediatrics clinic of another hospital. She was given a 7-day course of an oral antibiotic agent as empirical treatment for possible preseptal cellulitis.\nFive weeks before the current evaluation, the eye redness persisted despite treatment, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital. The blood pressure was not measured during this evaluation. The visual acuity with correction was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination revealed abundant white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were also keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and rare iris nodules in the right eye. Funduscopic examination was notable for optic-disk swelling and peripheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes, as well as perivascular exudates in the right eye. Cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes were prescribed.\nDuring the subsequent 3 weeks, additional tests were performed in the pediatrics clinic of the other hospital. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, syphilis, and Lyme disease were negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was indeterminate. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

On evaluation, she described eye redness that had persisted but decreased in severity. She reported no fever, weight loss, night sweats, rash, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or joint pain. On examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 96/61 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.3.\nThe patient appeared well, with no oral lesions or rash. The visual acuity was unchanged. Slit-lamp examination revealed keratic precipitates and white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were extensive posterior synechiae in the right eye. Funduscopic examination (Figure 2) showed vitreous white cells, optic-disk swelling, perivascular exudates, peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nFIGURE 2\n\nFundus Photographs.\nDuring the next 4 days, additional tests were performed, and sputum specimens were obtained for an acid-fast bacilli smear and culture. Optical coherence tomography revealed optic-disk swelling but no cystoid macular swelling. Fluorescein angiography revealed optic-disk leakage with areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion and some vessel leakage.\nDr. Figueiro Longo: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1C), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed protrusion and enhancement of the optic disks and enhancement of the irises, a finding consistent with the clinical diagnosis of uveitis. There was no evidence of optic neuritis or perineuritis.\nDr. Diacovo: The administration of cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes was continued. Treatment with oral prednisone was started, and a regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was begun as empirical treatment for possible tuberculosis. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. She was instructed to follow up in the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital and was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the rheumatology clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient had had normal growth and development and was currently in middle school. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had emigrated from West Africa to the United States 6 years earlier; since then, she had lived with her mother and father in a suburban town in New England and had not traveled outside the region. Six months before this evaluation, an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for M. tuberculosis had been positive. At that time, the patient had received a prescription for a medication to treat latent tuberculosis infection; however, the patient\u2019s parents could not recall giving the medication to the patient. She was taking the prescribed cyclopentolate and prednisolone eye drops, oral prednisone, and regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. There were no known drug allergies.

The white-cell count was 19,700 per microliter (reference range, 4800 to 10,800), the absolute lymphocyte count 6500 per microliter (reference range, 1000 to 5000), the absolute eosinophil count 3150 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 500), the absolute monocyte count 590 per microliter (reference range, 200 to 1000), and the plasma lactate level 2.6 mmol per liter (23.4 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.4 to 2.0 mmol per liter [3.6 to 18.0 mg per deciliter]). The blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function and coagulation; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed a perianal collection measuring 1.8 cm in diameter. Attempts to aspirate the perianal collection were unsuccessful, and a punch biopsy was performed.

Rectal pain had abated, and the patient was discharged home to complete a course of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid and doxycycline.\nTwo days after discharge from the other hospital, and 4 days before the current presentation, an erosive rash developed on the skin of the groin, with associated pruritus and pain in the affected area of the skin. The patient had no fever or chills. Over the course of the next 3 days, the rash progressed to the perineum and lower abdomen. One day before the current presentation, the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of the other hospital. Skin breakdown and purulent drainage were reportedly present on the skin of the perineum, lower abdomen, and inframammary folds; the rash was estimated to involve 7% of the total body-surface area. Laboratory evaluation showed leukocytosis, lymphocytosis, and eosinophilia. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed a focus of inflammation and soft-tissue thickening, measuring 2.4 cm in diameter, in the left perianal area. The left pelvic sidewall, right external iliac, and right and left inguinal lymph nodes were enlarged, measuring up to 2.1 cm in diameter; the spleen was normal in size. A diagnosis of the Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome was considered, treatment with intravenous fluids and glucocorticoids was started, and the patient was transferred to this hospital for further care.\nOn arrival at this hospital, the patient reported that the skin was no longer pruritic or painful. No eye pain, dysuria, or vaginal pain was present. She had a history of eczema and psoriasis, which had been diagnosed 3 years before the current presentation. Treatment with acitretin and topical betamethasone, clobetasol, and triamcinolone had been started for psoriasis, and had shown some benefit. Her eczema had been treated with dupilumab but was stopped after 6 months owing to ophthalmic complications. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, anxiety, and genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The last flare of genital HSV had occurred 3 years before the current presentation and had been treated with valacyclovir. Other medications included amlodipine, doxepin, gabapentin, insulin glargine, insulin lispro, metoprolol, and risperidone; lorazepam was used as needed for anxiety. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was retired and had previously worked as a nursing assistant. She was Black and lived with her sister in a suburb of Boston; she had not traveled outside the United States. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Both parents had diabetes; there was no family history of recurrent infections.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/71 mm Hg, the pulse 99 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 17.2. There were multiple punched-out, monomorphic ulcers coalescing into ulcerative plaques on the skin of the axillae, inframammary folds, neck, lower abdomen, pubic area, and both medial thighs with associated purulent drainage and malodor (Figure 1). Onychodystrophy was present on the fingernails and toenails. The palmar and dorsal aspects of both hands had scaling, deep fissuring, and serous crusting. Subtle blanching erythema covered more than 90% of the body-surface area; she had not noticed this change, and she did not know the timing of onset. No oral or mucosal lesions were present. There was nontender axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs of the Skin Obtained on Presentation to This Hospital.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The plasma level of lactate was 2.7 mmol per liter (24.3 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18.0 mg per deciliter]) and the blood level of C-reactive protein 130.9 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). The complete blood count with differential count was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nA sample of epidermal cells that was obtained from the base of an unroofed lesion was sent for HSV nucleic acid testing. Punch biopsies of the skin of the left axilla and the left upper arm were performed. A clinical diagnosis of Kaposi\u2019s varicelliform eruption (KVE) with superinfection was considered, and treatment with intravenous acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin was started. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\nOn the second hospital day, the white-cell count had increased to 17,270 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), and the absolute eosinophil count had increased to 6820 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 900). The blood level of troponin was 7 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 9), the cobalamin level 345 pg per milliliter (255 pmol per liter; reference value, >231 pg per milliliter [>170 pmol per liter]), the tryptase level 4.5 ng per milliliter (reference value, <11.5), and the IgE level 25,113 IU per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 100). Serum protein electrophoresis showed a normal pattern with a moderate diffuse decrease in the globulin level. Antibodies to antinuclear antigens were detected at a dilution of 1:40. Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Preliminary examination of the two skin-biopsy specimens revealed changes consistent with HSV infection in the left axilla and a psoriasiform dermatitis in the left upper arm; there was no evidence of cutaneous involvement caused by a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Cultures that were obtained from one of the groin wounds grew moderate amounts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment with ceftriaxone was stopped, and treatment with intravenous cefepime was started.\nDr. Rory L. Cochran: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a multilobulated mass in the superior segment of the left lower lobe that extended beyond the left major fissure (Figure 2A), along with multiple additional bilateral pulmonary nodules of varying size (Figure 2B); there was marked bilateral axillary and subpectoral lymphadenopathy (Figure 2C). Abdominal and pelvic images were remarkable for mild superficial soft-tissue thickening along the intergluteal cleft immediately posterior to the anal verge (Figure 2D and 2E), as well as bilateral external iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy (Figure 2F).\nFIGURE 2\n\nCT of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.\nDr. Lim: A diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Mollie Sands (Medicine): A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypoglycemia.\nThe patient had been well until 3 hours before this admission, when altered mental status developed while he was at work. During a meeting, his colleagues noticed that he was not paying attention or participating in the conversation, which was atypical of the patient. Instead, he was fidgeting and mumbling as though talking to another person. When his mobile telephone rang, he allowed it to continue ringing.\nTwo hours before this admission, the patient was found by colleagues on the floor of a conference room. His eyes were open, but he was obtunded and making nonpurposeful movements. Emergency medical services were called. On evaluation, a fingerstick glucose measurement was 39 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 109 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Intravenous dextrose was administered, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the patient was obtunded and did not react to sternal rub. Additional intravenous dextrose was administered, and a dextrose infusion was started. The patient\u2019s mental status improved, and he was able to provide additional history. That morning, he had felt that he was in a \u201cdreamlike\u201d state; there were no other symptoms. The altered mental status had resolved, but he could not recall most events of the morning, including the meeting that had taken place 3 hours before admission.\nReview of symptoms was notable for unintentional weight gain of one pant size during the past 3 months, as well as intermittent morning dizziness during the past 3 years, which would resolve after the patient ate candy or breakfast. He reported no recent illness, depression, anxiety, change in activity or exercise, or change in intake of food or drink. On a typical day, he had breakfast at 5 a.m., a second breakfast at 10 a.m., lunch at 1 p.m., dinner at 6 p.m., and a snack at 8 p.m. The patient had last eaten approximately 7 hours before presentation to the emergency department.\nTwo years earlier, the patient had had an episode of drooping and decreased sensation of the left side of the face and difficulty enunciating words, which occurred while he was at work. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital. The blood glucose level was 64 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter), and testing for Lyme disease was negative. He received a diagnosis of Bell\u2019s palsy and was treated with prednisone and acyclovir; the symptoms resolved. Two months later, the patient established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. Routine laboratory testing revealed a blood glucose level of 46 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter).\nThe patient took vitamin B12 and vitamin D supplements. He took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Sixteen years earlier, he had immigrated to the United States from Southeast Asia and now lived alone in an urban area of New England. He worked as a registered nurse. His father and brother had type 2 diabetes and used insulin.\nOn examination, the temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 82 beats per minute, the blood pressure 146/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.6. The patient appeared well. He had no hepatosplenomegaly or skin hyperpigmentation, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the blood glucose level was 36 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter); after the administration of dextrose, a fingerstick glucose measurement was 158 mg per deciliter (8.8 mmol per liter). The complete blood count and blood electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The glycated hemoglobin level was 5.4% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

    "user_input": "Dr. Viral S. Shah: A 26-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of respiratory failure and altered mental status.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current admission, when she underwent elective abdominoplasty and liposuction at an ambulatory surgery center. During the procedure, anesthetic agents included intravenous propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, and ketamine, as well as local lidocaine injections. During recovery after the procedure, medications included intravenous cefazolin, enoxaparin, and ondansetron; oral oxycodone, tramadol, and gabapentin; and transdermal scopolamine. The patient was lethargic after the procedure but was able to be discharged home after a period of observation.\nLater that day, the patient was instructed by telephone to take a lower dose of postoperative oxycodone. The next day, on evaluation at the surgical center, she was found to be somnolent but arousable and able to answer questions with effort; the scopolamine patch was removed. Several hours after the patient returned home, her family noticed that she had increased respiratory effort and minimal responsiveness. She was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of a local hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/77 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 83% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was lethargic, moaned intermittently, and responded with one-word answers; symmetric movement in the arms and legs was observed. Intravenous naloxone was administered, with minor improvement in her condition. Levels of electrolytes and results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, rightward axis deviation, and nonspecific ST\u2013T-wave changes.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults, Other Hospital), 1 Day before Transfer (Other Hospital), Reference Range (Adults, This Hospital), On Arrival (This Hospital)\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201315.2, 9.1, 12.0\u201316.0, 9.2\nHematocrit (%), 34.1\u201344.9, 26.3, 36.0\u201346.0, 27.6\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 3900\u201310,800, 21,800, 4500\u201311,000, 17,670\n\nDifferential count (%):\nNeutrophils (%), 43\u201374, 82, 40\u201370, 92.7\nLymphocytes (%), 17\u201344, 8.4, 22\u201344, 4.4\nMonocytes (%), 4\u201313, 8.3, 4\u201311, 1.7\nEosinophils (%), 1\u201310, 0.6, 0\u20138, 0.0\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 154,000\u2013369,000, 201,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 221,000\nAlbumin (g/dl), 2.5, 3.5\u20134.8, 3.3\u20135.0, 3.1\nLactate (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.2, 4.5, 0.5\u20132.2, 1.6\nProcalcitonin (ng/ml), <0.10, 3.09, 0.00\u20130.08, 1.59\nTroponin I (ng/ml), <0.029, 0.65, \u2014, \u2014\nHigh-sensitivity troponin T (ng/liter), \u2014, \u2014, <0.03, 237\nB-type natriuretic peptide (pg/ml), 0\u2013100, 395, \u2014, \u2014\nN-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (pg/ml), \u2014, \u2014, <450, 1865\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), \u2014, \u2014, 0\u201313, 63\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), \u2014, \u2014, <8, 204.8\nTriglycerides (mg/dl), \u2014, \u2014, 0\u2013150, 167\n\nArterial blood gas:\nFraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.00\npH, \u2014, \u2014, 7.35\u20137.45, 7.44\nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), \u2014, \u2014, 35\u201342, 39\nPartial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), \u2014, \u2014, 80\u2013100, 116\n\nDr. Dexter P. Mendoza: A chest radiograph showed diffuse confluent opacities in both lungs (Figure 1A). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary-embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed diffuse mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving all lobes of the lungs, with relative sparing of the subpleural lung (Figure 1B). CT of the abdomen revealed postoperative changes. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild effacement of the cerebral sulci and cisterns on both sides, a finding suggestive of mild diffuse cerebral edema (Figure 1C and 1D). There was also a small hypodensity in the left globus pallidus, a finding suggestive of infarction.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies.\nDr. Shah: Noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the other hospital. Intravenous vancomycin, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir were administered empirically, and a triple-lumen central venous catheter was inserted.\nThe next morning, the findings on a repeat chest radiograph appeared to be unchanged, but the patient had progressive lethargy, so intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Pink frothy secretions were noted. Intravenous methylprednisolone, propofol, and norepinephrine were administered. A nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. The troponin I level increased to 4.31 ng per milliliter (reference range, <0.029). The thyrotropin, carboxyhemoglobin, and lipase levels were normal, and tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigens were negative.\nLater that afternoon, the patient was transferred to the ICU at this hospital. A review of systems was unavailable because intubation was performed on arrival. Medical history that was obtained from family members included iron-deficiency anemia, anxiety disorder, insomnia, and two normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Regular medications included lorazepam as needed for sleep; postoperative medications included tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone as needed for pain. There were no known adverse reactions to medication. The patient had attended college and worked in an office. She lived with her husband and children. She drank alcohol intermittently and did not use tobacco or other substances. There was no family history of cardiopulmonary or neurologic disorders.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg while the patient was receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 8 \u03bcg per minute. The height was 168 cm and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.8. The oxygen saturation was 99% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in volume-control mode (tidal volume, 320 ml; positive end-expiratory pressure, 12 cm of water; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0). The pupils were 2 mm and symmetrically reactive. The lung sounds were coarse. The abdominal incision was well approximated and without drainage; abdominal drains were in place on both sides. A neurologic examination with interruption of sedation showed spontaneous eye-opening but an inability to visually track and to follow commands. Brain-stem reflexes were intact. The legs withdrew equally and briskly in response to pain. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nA chest radiograph showed diffuse opacities in both lungs. Levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, creatine kinase, lipase, and ammonia were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Urine toxicologic screening was negative except for the presence of opiates. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram including posterior leads showed sinus rhythm, rightward axis deviation, diminutive Q waves, and minor nonspecific ST\u2013T-wave abnormalities. An abdominal radiograph showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern, subcutaneous emphysema, and surgical drains over the pelvis. On bedside cardiac ultrasonography, the left ventricle could not be visualized clearly, but right ventricular dilatation did not appear to be present. Intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered.\nDr. Mendoza: CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed hypodensities in the left basal ganglia and right cerebellum that were suggestive of infarcts; the previously described cerebral edema had reduced slightly. A CT angiogram of the head and neck was normal. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a reduction in ground-glass opacities but an increase in consolidations, particularly in the lower lobes. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a small anterior abdominal hematoma and diffuse subcutaneous emphysema.\nDr. Shah: A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. On hospital day 2, the findings on neurologic examination worsened, with only sluggish eye-opening and no motor responses to noxious stimuli. Intravenous mannitol at a dose of 1 g per kilogram of body weight was administered.\nDr. Mendoza: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a hypodensity in the left globus pallidus that had not changed from the previous study, as well as a hypodensity in the right cerebellum that was not definitive and was probably an artifact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed infarcts within the globi pallidi and smaller punctate infarcts in the cerebral white matter. There were also innumerable diffuse microhemorrhagic foci affecting the cerebral white matter, including the corpus callosum (Figure 2).\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Shah: Bronchoscopy revealed bloody mucus in the distal trachea (Figure 3). Serial bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed in the right upper lobe revealed increasingly erythematous effluent.\nFIGURE 3\n\nImages Obtained on Bronchoscopy.\nLupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were not detected. Levels of C3 and C4 were normal. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Tests for legionella, streptococcus, and galactomannan urinary antigens and antitreponemal antibodies were negative, as was a repeat nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2.\nDr. Yasmin Aghajan: On hospital day 3, the patient underwent continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. The study was abnormal because of generalized rhythmic delta activity at a frequency of 1 Hz, which occasionally evolved to generalized periodic discharges superimposed on a disorganized background with irregular delta and theta slowing. There were no epileptiform abnormalities. Although generalized rhythmic delta activity and generalized periodic discharges are on the ictal\u2013interictal continuum, there were no features suggestive of seizures. The electroencephalographic findings were consistent with encephalopathy and the effects of propofol.\nA diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Will Pohlman (Medicine): An 82-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of difficulty walking, falls, and cognitive decline.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health, living independently with her husband and participating in a walking club, until 8 months before the current presentation, when generalized weakness developed. She began to walk more slowly and was no longer active with her walking club; she felt limited by pain in her feet.\nFive months before the current presentation, the patient began to have difficulty with climbing stairs and with rising from a seated position. Four months before the current presentation, she began to have falls at home.\nThree months before the current presentation, the patient fell and her husband was not able to lift her up from the floor. Emergency medical services were called, and she was admitted to another hospital for evaluation. During that hospitalization, a urinary tract infection and hyponatremia were diagnosed. The urinary tract infection was treated with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. The hyponatremia was attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone and was treated with fluid restriction and salt tablets. The use of a walker was recommended, and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. After 3 weeks in the rehabilitation facility, she was discharged home, but she fell again at home and subsequently returned to the other hospital for evaluation. She was readmitted to the other hospital and again discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\nEight weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from the rehabilitation facility, and she and her husband moved to an assisted-living facility. Fatigue developed, along with loss of appetite and a reduced intake of food. The patient began to need one-person assistance to walk. She also noticed that she had been having difficulty with math associated with the family finances, which she had always done with ease. Her family noticed that she had been having trouble carrying on a conversation and that she seemed less attentive than usual.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, the patient had another fall and was admitted to a second hospital, where she was found to have hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head reportedly showed moderate chronic small-vessel ischemic changes and ventriculomegaly. Increased food intake was encouraged, and outpatient evaluation in the neurology clinic affiliated with the second hospital was arranged. Discharge to a rehabilitation facility was recommended, but after discussions between the patient and her family, the patient returned to the assisted-living facility.\nAfter discharge from the hospital, the patient had a progressive loss of independence. She noted worsening generalized weakness and low back pain, and she needed two-person assistance to walk. Her family brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported urinary incontinence, which she attributed to not having enough time to get to the toilet because of her physical limitations with movement; she had no dysuria or urinary urgency. There was no fecal incontinence.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. Surgical history included hemiarthroplasty of the right shoulder and arthroplasty of both knees. She had chronic pain in the shoulders, knees, wrists, and hands, which had been attributed to osteoarthritis; the knee and shoulder pain had decreased after the surgeries but then returned during the year before the current presentation. Medications included atorvastatin, calcium citrate, levothyroxine, lisinopril, and tramadol. She had no known drug allergies. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. In addition to her husband, her support network included four children who lived near the assisted-living facility. She was retired and had previously worked in finance. Her mother had had diabetes, and her father had had thyroid cancer; there was no known family history of dementia or neurodegenerative disorders.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/54 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. She appeared tired but was oriented to person and place. Pitting edema was present in the legs to the level of the mid-shins. A detailed strength examination was limited because of pain, with minimal movement of the shoulders, wrists, fingers, ankles, and knees. The patient could wiggle her toes but had weak plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of both feet. She could easily wiggle her fingers and lift her arms against gravity at the elbows. Light touch of the dorsum of the right hand caused pain, as did light touch of the right knee and the soles of both feet. Recognition of sensation to light touch and to vibration were normal. Cerebellar testing, gait testing, and reflex testing were limited by severe pain with movement and touch. The patient had symmetric erythema, swelling, and tenderness of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. She had limited range of motion in the wrists and elbows, along with symmetric tenderness in the subtalar joints and swelling and pain with squeezing of the metatarsophalangeal joints.\nThe blood levels of alcohol, ammonia, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and urine toxicology screening; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 3+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative) and the presence of nitrates (reference value, negative), and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). Urine was obtained for culture, and intravenous ceftriaxone was administered.

Huang: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed moderate ventriculomegaly that was out of proportion to the enlargement of the cerebral sulci (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Head.\nDr. Pohlman: A high-volume lumbar puncture with gait evaluation before and after the procedure was not possible, given the patient\u2019s inability to walk unassisted. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus was generally thought to be unlikely to explain her presentation. Altered mental status was attributed to delirium in the context of tramadol use and urinary tract infection. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nOn hospital day 2, the urine culture grew Citrobacter farmeri; treatment with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was started. MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was terminated early because of the patient\u2019s pain, and the images that were obtained were degraded by motion artifacts. However, no marked signal abnormality in the spinal cord or high-grade spinal or foraminal stenosis was observed. Additional laboratory studies were obtained. Tests for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus antibodies, and hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative. The blood levels of glycated hemoglobin and cobalamin were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation; blood samples were obtained for measurement of copper and vitamin B6 levels. Treatment with gabapentin was started for neuropathic pain. On hospital day 3, pain had not decreased, and the dose of gabapentin was increased.\nDr. Bart K. Chwalisz: On hospital day 4, electromyography and nerve conduction studies were performed. The amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was normal with stimulation of the right tibial nerve but was reduced with stimulation of the left tibial nerve and both peroneal nerves; in addition, the CMAP amplitude of the left ulnar nerve was mildly reduced, and that of the left median nerve was normal. The sensory-nerve action potential of the left radial nerve was normal, but the sensory-nerve action potential of the left sural nerve could not be obtained. The conduction velocities and distal latencies were normal. There was no abnormal spontaneous activity in any muscle examined. The motor-unit action potentials and motor-unit recruitment with voluntary activation were normal throughout.\nDr. Pohlman: The results of the additional blood tests became available. The copper level was normal, and the vitamin B6 level was less than 2 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50). Treatment with vitamin B6 supplementation was started.\nAdditional diagnostic tests were performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Jamie Aron (Emergency Medicine): A 27-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of leg weakness.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 days before the current presentation, when myalgias developed in the upper legs. He initially attributed the pain to increased physical activity while at work in construction. When he awoke on the morning of the current presentation, he could not lift his legs to move in bed or to stand up. He also had weakness in the arms, although it was less pronounced than the weakness in the legs. He asked his family to bring him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing weakness. He had no history of trauma, back pain, or saddle anesthesia. There were no changes in sensation. He had no other relevant medical history, and he took no prescribed medications. He had moved to Boston from El Salvador 5 months before the current presentation.\nAfter arriving in Boston, the patient had begun to have increasing difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep, which he had attributed to stress. He had had loose stools but a normal appetite and was eating normally with no abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting; he estimated a weight loss of approximately 5 kg since moving to Boston. In addition, he reported that he had had trembling in his hands for several months before the current presentation, which he had also attributed to stress. Four days before the current presentation, he began taking an herbal supplement (sold under the brand name Nervitran) that was intended to reduce stress. He had no known allergies. He drank alcohol occasionally, had never smoked tobacco, and did not use illicit drugs. There was no family history of hypertension or liver disease; a maternal aunt had had an episode of weakness, but the patient was not aware of a diagnosis.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 144/79 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. Conjunctival injection was present in both eyes. Muscle strength was 4/5 on abduction of both shoulders and on flexion and extension of the elbows, wrists, and fingers. Muscle strength was 5/5 on knee flexion and extension and 3/5 on hip flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion. Sensation to light touch and temperature was normal. Patellar reflexes were 3+. There was a low-amplitude, high-frequency fine tremor in the hands, which was more prominent in the left hand than in the right hand. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe complete blood count was normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation. A blood toxicology screen was negative for salicylates, acetaminophen, ethanol, and tricyclic antidepressant medications. The blood level of aspartate aminotransferase was 56 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), the alanine aminotransferase level 65 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the alkaline phosphatase level 137 U per liter (reference range, 45 to 115), the total bilirubin level 1.3 mg per deciliter (22 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.0 to 1.0 mg per deciliter [0 to 17 \u03bcmol per liter]), the potassium level 1.8 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.0), the creatine kinase level 382 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400), and the aldolase level 9.9 U per liter (reference value, <7.7); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A urinalysis was not performed. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, incomplete right bundle-branch block, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Potassium chloride was administered orally at a dose of 60 meq. Three hours later, the blood level of potassium was 4.2 mmol per liter, and the weakness in the patient\u2019s arms and legs had abated.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Presentation\n\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 141\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 1.8\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 106\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 23\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 17\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.53\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 141\nAnion gap (mmol/liter), 3\u201317, 12\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 10.4\nMagnesium (mg/dl), 1.7\u20132.4, 1.8\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 30\u2013100, 156\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201333, 67\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201332, 54\n\nBilirubin (mg/dl):\nTotal, 0.0\u20131.0, 1.3\nDirect, 0.0\u20130.4, 0.3\n\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.1\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 4.1\nCreatine kinase (U/liter), 60\u2013400, 382\nAldolase (U/liter), <7.7, 9.9\n\nVenous blood gases:\npH, 7.30\u20137.40, 7.29\nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 38\u201350, 56\nPartial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 35\u201350, 32\n\nAdditional diagnostic tests were performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. John H. Stone: A 59-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of headache and progressive neurologic dysfunction.\nTen months before this evaluation, daily fever with a temperature of up to 38.9\u00b0C, chills, myalgias, drenching night sweats, and pressure and pain in both cheeks and ears developed. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported rhinorrhea and fatigue but no headache, pharyngitis, or dyspnea, and he had no sick contacts. On examination, the temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/64 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was ill-appearing, and the maxillary sinuses were tender on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 463,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 400,000); the remainder of the complete blood count and the differential count were normal. Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was prescribed.\nDuring the next 2 weeks, fever, night sweats, and sinus and facial pain continued. Diffuse headache developed, along with jaw soreness, scalp tenderness, and hip and shoulder stiffness. The patient was evaluated again by his primary care physician. He reported weight loss of 2 kg, episodic double vision, and hip pain that caused difficulty in standing and climbing stairs. The physical examination was unchanged. Urinalysis was normal. A test for heterophile antibody and an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative, as were screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus and Lyme disease. Chest radiography and computed tomography of the sinuses were normal. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist at another hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported persistent fever and frontal, temporal, and maxillary headache. There were palpable temporal artery pulses without tenderness; the remainder of the examination was normal, including the absence of bruits on auscultation of large vessels. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 108 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), the blood level of C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), the blood level of rheumatoid factor 24 IU per milliliter (reference value, <14), and the blood level of aldolase 8.4 IU per milliliter (reference value, <8.1). Biopsy of the right temporal artery was performed. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed no granulomas, but evidence of chronic inflammation of the temporal artery and fibrinoid necrosis of an adjacent small vessel were noted.\nA diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis was made, and treatment with prednisone was started. Within a few days after initiation of treatment, headache, fever, jaw pain, and joint stiffness abated. The next month, an attempt to lower the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent severe headache with scalp tenderness, jaw pain, and hip stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 84 mg per liter. Treatment with weekly subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab was initiated.\nDuring the next 6 weeks, another attempt was made to taper the prednisone dose. After 1 week of treatment at a lower prednisone dose, and 5 months after the development of initial symptoms (5 months before the current evaluation), the patient reported headache that he described as \u201cthe worst headache of my life,\u201d with associated jaw pain and diplopia. The pain was worst at the right frontal and maxillary areas, but the entire right side of the face, including the scalp and neck, was affected. The patient returned to the other hospital for evaluation. He was found to have palsies of the third and sixth cranial nerves on the right side. The patient was admitted to the neurology service at the other hospital. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing revealed a slightly elevated myeloperoxidase antibody level, at 1.9 U (reference value, <1.0), but antibodies to proteinase 3 were not detected. Blood levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Otto Rapalino: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed abnormal expansion and enhancement of the right cavernous sinus that extended into the right superior orbital fissure and right pterygopalatine fossa, as well as abnormal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement of the adjacent right middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Figure 1C and 1D) showed masslike pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement in the upper cervical spinal canal at C2\u2013C4 with an anterior predominance as well as more circumferentially at the cervicothoracic junction (C6\u2013T3) with a posterior predominance, with resultant canal narrowing and mild cord compression at C7\u2013T2. There was no spinal cord edema.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head and Spine Obtained 5 Months before the Current Evaluation.\nDr. John Stone: A lumbar puncture was performed; an opening pressure was not recorded. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose level was 65 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 80 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.4 mmol per liter]), and the protein level was 126 mg per deciliter (reference range, 15 to 45), with 2 red cells per microliter and 8 white cells per microliter (of which 79% were lymphocytes). Gram\u2019s staining and cultures of the CSF were negative. Tests for CSF myelin basic protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme, cryptococcal antigen, cysticercosis IgG, mycobacterial DNA, Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA, and borrelia DNA were negative, as was a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. Cytologic analysis of the CSF showed a mixed population of mononuclear cells with rare plasma cells. The CSF immunoglobulin level was 19 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0 to 6), with 5 oligoclonal bands.\nOn the eighth hospital day, a meningeal biopsy was performed. Treatment with high-dose prednisone was started, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 2 weeks, the patient continued taking the prednisone, but the facial and head pain worsened. He was readmitted to the other hospital to receive 3 days of treatment with parenteral pulse-dose methylprednisolone.\nPathological examination of the meningeal biopsy specimen revealed a densely fibrotic, chronically inflamed dura mater with large numbers of CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ T lymphocytes and with focal collections of CD20+ B lymphocytes. There was a large number of polyclonal plasma cells with more than 100 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-power field. Storiform fibrosis was present, and elastin staining revealed obliterative venulitis. Some of the inflammatory foci were angiocentric, but no vasculitis was present. There were rare foci of fibrinoid necrosis and some neutrophils, with rare giant cells but no granulomas. A diagnosis of IgG4-related disease was made, and rituximab was administered. Two days after the first rituximab dose, a pulmonary embolism was diagnosed, and treatment with apixaban was initiated. Two weeks later, repeat imaging was obtained to evaluate the treatment response.\nDr. Rapalino: Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased abnormal enhancement in the right cavernous sinus and right middle cranial fossa and new abnormal enhancement in the left cavernous sinus and adjacent left middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Figure 2C and 2D) also showed progression in the extent and thickness of the ventral and dorsal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement. There was also progression of the canal stenosis, which had become severe, and cord compression at the C7 level. There was no cord signal abnormality.\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head and Spine Obtained 4 Months before the Current Evaluation.\nDr. John Stone: The patient received a second infusion of rituximab, as well as treatment with oral dexamethasone. Three weeks later, and 7 months after the development of initial symptoms (3 months before the current evaluation), the patient was admitted to the other hospital because of worsening headache, nausea, and vomiting. Examination was notable for new sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and deviation of the tongue to the left. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Treatment with dexamethasone was continued, and the patient was discharged home. Three weeks after placement of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the patient was admitted again to the other hospital because of streptococcal infection. Two months after discharge, and 10 months after the development of initial symptoms, he was seen in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation.\nThe patient had a history of migraines, hypertension, and a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. Medications included apixaban, baclofen, dexamethasone, furosemide, gabapentin, lisinopril, and metoprolol. He was a retired businessman and lived with his wife. He drank one glass of wine weekly and had quit smoking more than 40 years before the current evaluation. His maternal grandfather had died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm.\nThe temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 118/79 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The scalp hair was thin. He had cushingoid facies; acne on the face, back, and chest; striae on the flanks; and proximal muscle weakness of the arms and legs. There was no scalp or temporal tenderness. He had no tongue lesions or oral ulcers, and the nasal examination showed no crusting. Extraocular movements were intact. There was no arthritis. The chest, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were normal. The complete blood count and the differential count were normal, as was a urinalysis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 52 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 5 mg per liter. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed an IgM level of 22 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334) and normal levels of IgG and IgA. ANCA testing was negative.\nA diagnosis and management decisions were made.",

Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The result of testing for group B streptococcus colonization was not available; empirical treatment with vancomycin was administered. Spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred, resulting in clear, odorless fluid. Eight hours later, the patient vaginally delivered a male infant and an intact placenta. She had lost an estimated 300 ml of blood, and she had a second-degree perineal laceration, which was repaired. The baby was large for gestational age, weighing 3575 g. On the second postpartum day, the patient was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent 4 days, the patient pumped breast milk and visited her baby in the special care nursery of this hospital daily while he was being treated for prematurity and feeding difficulties. She had mild diffuse abdominal and pelvic cramping and vaginal bleeding with occasional clots. On the day of the current admission, fever and chills developed, and the patient returned to the emergency department of this hospital. Review of systems was notable for small, painful bumps in the inguinal area on both sides that had developed during pregnancy and had intermittently drained blood and pus. She also had leg swelling that had abated since childbirth.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 38.7\u00b0C and the blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg. The lungs were clear on auscultation, the breasts nontender, the uterine fundus mildly tender, and the legs mildly swollen. Tender, erythematous pustules that drained yellow, purulent fluid were present in the inguinal area on the right side; scarring was present in the inguinal area on the left side. The repaired perineal laceration was healing well. The white-cell count was 22,940 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and cervical cultures were obtained.\nThe patient had rosacea, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa. Episodes of diverticulitis had occurred 5 years and 2 years before this admission, and an episode of epiploic appendagitis had occurred 10 weeks before this admission. She was taking prenatal vitamins, topical azelaic acid, and acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for abdominal pain. Amoxicillin and cephalexin had caused hives. She worked as an educator and lived with her husband and dog in a suburban area of New England. She did not vape or smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her father and paternal grandfather had arthritis that had been diagnosed in early adulthood, her brother had Crohn\u2019s disease, and another brother had neurofibromatosis. Her mother was healthy.\nDr. Rory L. Cochran: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed normal postpartum uterine enlargement, with mild adjacent fat stranding.\nDr. Siegel: Empirical treatment with gentamicin and clindamycin was started. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of endometritis. Fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis did not abate, and vancomycin was added on hospital day 3. A test dose of cefepime was administered on hospital day 4. When the patient did not have an allergic reaction to the test dose, gentamicin and clindamycin were stopped, and she was treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole.\nDr. Melanie C. Kwan: On hospital day 6, an endometrial biopsy was performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed neutrophilic debris that included fragments of stroma with a dense neutrophilic infiltrate.\nDr. Cochran: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography of the pelvis, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed mild ascites (Figure 1A) and anasarca (Figure 1B). No evidence of retained products of conception, fluid collections, or venous or arterial thromboses was observed. Four days later, magnetic resonance angiography of the pelvis revealed increased ascites and anasarca, as well as two new fluid collections: a peripherally enhancing left parametrial collection that measured 6.3 cm in largest dimension (Figure 1C) and a collection located near the right uterocervical junction that measured 3.2 cm in largest dimension (Figure 1D).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Abdomen and Pelvis.\nDr. Siegel: Treatment with cefepime and metronidazole was stopped, vancomycin was continued, and meropenem was started because of ongoing fever. A percutaneous catheter was inserted into the left parametrial fluid collection, and 20 ml of purulent fluid was drained; cultures showed no growth.\nOn hospital day 11, abdominal pain increased, and shortness of breath developed. The oxygen saturation was 86% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 91%. The temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 109/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The patient appeared tired and ill. Marked jugular venous distention was present. The heart sounds were tachycardic and regular, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was distended and diffusely tender on palpation, and the percutaneous catheter inserted along the midline of the pelvis had scant purulent drainage. Diffuse anasarca and symmetric 1+ ankle edema were present. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal biventricular function; however, the right atrium and right ventricle were dilated, and the interventricular septum was flattened during diastole. The main pulmonary artery and its branches were also dilated.\nDr. Cochran: CT pulmonary angiography showed bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis and no pulmonary embolism. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed increased ascites and anasarca, new splenomegaly, new hepatomegaly with heterogeneous peripheral enhancement (Figure 1E), and mild periportal edema. The percutaneously drained left parametrial fluid collection had resolved; the fluid collection at the right uterocervical junction remained unchanged. Results of liver-function tests were abnormal, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed multiple new intrahepatic fluid collections, which were hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging (Figure 1F).\nDr. Daniela Kroshinsky: The next day, new edematous, violaceous, friable plaques developed on the left upper arm at the site where a previous peripheral intravenous catheter had been inserted. A new erythematous-to-violaceous bulla on the left abdominal wall also developed. The plaques located on the left arm subsequently ulcerated (Figure 2A), as did new skin lesions located in the right inguinal crease and on the mons pubis. During the next 2 days, the bulla located on the left abdominal wall also began to ulcerate, and another similar lesion formed around the site where the percutaneous drainage catheter had been inserted. The ulcers involving the left upper arm, right inguinal crease, and mons pubis increased in area and depth, and a new ulcer formed in the left inguinal crease.\nFIGURE 2\n\nClinical Photographs of the Lesion on the Left Upper Arm before and after Treatment.\nDr. Siegel: Treatment with intravenous furosemide was administered. Vancomycin was stopped, meropenem was continued, and daptomycin and micafungin were started.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

After an episode of sports-related exertional dizziness, he was evaluated by a physician, and a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was considered.\nTwenty-five years before the current evaluation, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 19 mm (reference value, \u226411), a left ventricular ejection fraction of 74% (reference range, 50 to 75), mitral valve thickening, and trace mitral regurgitation, with no left ventricular outflow gradient. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle-branch block, precordial J-point elevation, and QRS voltage that met the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure 1A). The patient\u2019s blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, and he started treatment with metoprolol succinate and then also with amlodipine for elevated blood pressure.\nFIGURE 1\n\nElectrocardiograms.\nDuring the next 10 years, the patient had intermittent chest discomfort, exertional dyspnea, and leg edema. The chest discomfort and exertional dyspnea were most likely to occur when he was walking or after he had eaten a meal. He was evaluated by three cardiologists; treatment with metoprolol succinate and amlodipine was continued, treatment with enalapril was started, and triamterene\u2013hydrochlorothiazide was administered as needed for leg edema.\nA repeat TTE reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 20 mm, a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular wall thickening, left atrial enlargement, mitral valve thickening, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, aortic valve thickening, and mild ascending aortic dilatation (39 mm), with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. An exercise stress test followed by imaging performed with the use of sestamibi (known as a sestamibi stress test) revealed left ventricular wall thickening, with no perfusion defects. Coronary angiography revealed evidence of chronic total occlusion of the distal left anterior descending artery, with collateral flow from both the left and right coronary arteries. Left ventriculography revealed hyperdynamic left ventricular function and 2+ mitral regurgitation (see Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 28 mm Hg (reference range, 5 to 10), with no left ventricular intracavitary gradient, including during ventricular ectopic beats and during the Valsalva maneuver, and with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The blood pressure remained well controlled while the patient was taking metoprolol, amlodipine, and enalapril.\nNine years before the current evaluation, the patient had complete heart block with symptomatic bradycardia (Figure 1B), with associated nausea, dizziness, and chest discomfort. A temporary transvenous pacing wire was placed; the results of coronary angiography performed at that time were unchanged from the previous study. The creatinine level was 1.2 mg per deciliter (106 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]); the blood levels of electrolytes and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis. A dual-chamber implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) was placed. Four months later, atrial fibrillation developed. Cardioversion was performed with guidance by transesophageal echocardiography, resulting in sinus rhythm. However, atrial fibrillation recurred after 3 days. Treatment with amiodarone and warfarin was begun.\nDuring the next 5 years, recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. A repeat TTE showed a left ventricular wall thickness of 23 mm and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.\nFour years before the current evaluation, during a holiday trip, the patient was hospitalized in another state because of pulmonary edema that developed after he had consumed food that was high in sodium. He was treated with intravenous furosemide and discharged with a prescription for oral furosemide. Findings on TTE were reportedly similar to those observed previously. Treatment with amlodipine was stopped because of lightheadedness.\nAt follow-up appointments during the next 4 years, the patient reported fatigue and exertional dyspnea that occurred after he had climbed one flight of stairs or when he was walking on an incline. In addition, he had nocturia once per night, slept on two pillows, and had intermittent wheezing, including episodes that awakened him from sleep. Treatment with oral furosemide (administered twice daily) was continued. Recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. Approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation, the patient sustained a fall that was unrelated to his cardiac condition. At that time, computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of hemorrhage or stroke but showed periventricular and deep white-matter hypodensities. Results of pulmonary-function testing were normal.\nThe patient presented for the current evaluation at the request of his two teenage grandsons, who wanted to know about any familial cardiac risk factors that could influence their participation in sports. A review of systems was notable for intermittent palpitations, chronic dry eyes, reduced hearing, tinnitus in both ears (greater in the right ear than in the left ear), restless legs, and constipation. The patient reported no headache, paresthesia, stroke symptoms, diarrhea, skin changes, or intolerance to heat or cold. His medical history included cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, atrioventricular block and atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, cataracts, and prostatic hypertrophy with carcinoma in situ. Medications included furosemide, warfarin, amiodarone, aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, enalapril, and tamsulosin, as well as inhaled fluticasone. Amiodarone had caused thyroiditis, which had been treated with a course of prednisone; there were no other known adverse reactions to medication.\nThe patient was a retired executive and lived with his spouse in Massachusetts. His family history was notable for brain cancer in his father, obstructive lung disease and lung cancer in his mother, and lung cancer in his sister, who had died from the disease. There was also a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in his sister and in a niece. His family was of Mediterranean origin; information about other relatives was limited. His son and grandsons were healthy, and his son had reportedly had normal results on an electrocardiogram and echocardiograms. The patient did not drink alcohol and had never used tobacco.\nOn examination, the heart rate was 79 beats per minute and the blood pressure 106/60 mm Hg. The weight was 89 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 26.6. There was a left ventricular heave. Auscultation revealed splitting of the S2 heart sound, a grade 3/6 systolic murmur that could be heard throughout the precordium and did not change during the Valsalva maneuver, and a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiated to the axilla; there was no S3 heart sound. There was trace leg edema and mild chronic venous stasis. The rest of the examination was normal.\nLaboratory test results were notable for a creatinine level of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 \u03bcmol per liter), a urea nitrogen level of 39 mg per deciliter (13.9 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), an international normalized ratio of 2.1 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), and an N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2523 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 1800), as well as 1+ protein on urinalysis. The blood levels of iron, glycated hemoglobin, thyrotropin, and free thyroxine were normal, and a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing.\nA TTE was obtained, and additional diagnostic tests were performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. James W. Luccarelli (Psychiatry): A 70-year-old man with bipolar disorder was evaluated at this hospital because of depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and gait disturbance.\nThe patient had a long history of depressive episodes, with two previous hospitalizations for suicide attempts. Approximately two decades before the current admission, he was struck on the head with a beam while working at a construction site and had a 4-cm laceration. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital, where the wound was sutured but no further evaluation was conducted.\nApproximately 10 years before the current admission, around the time of his mother\u2019s death, the patient was evaluated at this hospital because of an episode of irritability, a reduced need for sleep, and grandiosity; he reported feelings of \u201ctranscendence\u201d and being \u201cat one with God.\u201d He was admitted for 1 month to the psychiatry unit of a second hospital, where he was treated with lithium and electroconvulsive therapy. Thereafter, he received outpatient psychiatric treatment on a monthly basis, as well as therapy with valproic acid and fluoxetine.\nApproximately 9 years before the current admission, the patient fell on concrete stairs and had back pain with subsequent lower-leg weakness and urinary incontinence. He was evaluated at a third hospital, where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes, including L4\u2013L5 spinal stenosis and central disk protrusion. Acetaminophen and physical therapy were prescribed.\nFive years later (4 years before the current admission), the patient fell because of an unsteady gait and was evaluated at a fourth hospital. Neurologic examination revealed a memory deficit (with an inability to recall any objects after 5 minutes on the three-item object-recall test) and poor attention (with an inability to perform serial sevens calculations), as well as action tremor in the arms and \u201cmildly unsteady\u201d gait, even with the use of a cane. The remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, results of renal function tests, and levels of electrolytes, valproic acid, folate, vitamin B12, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin were normal; serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. MRI of the head reportedly revealed no evidence of an infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or a mass but showed mild prominence of ventricles, sulci, and cisterns. The dose of fluoxetine was decreased, and the patient was discharged 3 days later.\nAdditional falls occurred 2 months and 4 months later, and both times, the patient was evaluated at the fourth hospital. Two months after the most recent fall, he hit the car in front of him while driving. His psychiatrist noted that he had bilateral tremor at rest; the dose of valproic acid was reduced, and he was referred to a neurologist. Two months after the car crash, he fell while walking and was evaluated at the fourth hospital. The evaluation was notable for nystagmus and a normal valproic acid level (89 \u03bcg per milliliter; reference range, 50 to 100) despite the dose reduction; the doses of valproic acid and trazodone were reduced, and physical therapy was provided. During the next 5 months, gait instability was reduced but persisted. The patient was evaluated by two other neurologists after reporting a feeling of \u201cimbalance.\u201d Audiometry revealed mild-to-moderate high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Medications were considered to be a contributor to his balance dysfunction.\nDuring the next 12 months, the dose of valproic acid was tapered and fluoxetine was stopped; the patient underwent trials of escitalopram and then sertraline for the treatment of depressive symptoms. He reported to his psychiatrist symptoms of confusion, some difficulty with memory, and decreased leg coordination. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 23 (scores range from 0 to 30, with a score of 18 to 25 suggesting mild cognitive impairment).\nDr. McKinley Glover: Fifteen months before the current admission, the patient began to have dizziness. MRI of the head (Figure 1), performed at this hospital, revealed an old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss, and mild ventricular prominence.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial MRI of the Head.\nDr. Luccarelli: Neuropsychiatric testing was performed, and the results did not suggest a neurodegenerative process. Given the patient\u2019s progressively depressed mood, treatment with aripiprazole was started, with the dose adjusted over the following 12 months.\nThree months before the current admission, the patient reported worsening depression, with hopelessness, guilt, and increased sleep. That month, his son found him unable to walk and requiring assistance to move. On examination, he had tremor and muscle rigidity; on ambulation, he had a shuffling gait and required a cane. Treatment with aripiprazole was stopped, benztropine was started, and sertraline was replaced by fluoxetine.\nOne month before the current admission, the patient was voluntarily hospitalized in the psychiatry unit of this hospital because of worsening depression, which he attributed to the progressive reduction in mobility and strength. He reported 3 weeks of frequent early morning awakenings, anhedonia, low energy, anorexia, difficulty concentrating, and low motivation, such that he had not paid bills or bathed. Examination was notable for tremor, muscle rigidity, and a shuffling gait. Blood levels of folate, vitamin B12, and glycated hemoglobin were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 antibodies and type 1 antigen and for antitreponemal antibodies were negative. Over the 5-day hospitalization, the dose of fluoxetine was increased and treatment with lurasidone was started.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), 1 Mo before Admission (This Hospital), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 130, 136  \nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 4.6, 4.4  \nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 92, 99  \nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 25, 24  \nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 21, 18  \nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.99, 1.02  \nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 77, 74  \nValproic acid (\u03bcg/ml), 50\u2013100, 66.8, 50.8  \n25-Hydroxyvitamin D (ng/ml), 20\u201380, 27, 29  \nThyrotropin (\u03bcIU/ml), 0.40\u20135.00, 6.66, 3.21  \nFree thyroxine (ng/dl), 0.9\u20131.8, 1.2, \u2014\n\nDuring the following 4 weeks, the patient\u2019s ability to walk continued to deteriorate, and he required intermittent use of a walker and a wheelchair. His depressive symptoms persisted, and after he reported thoughts of suicide and feeling unsafe to his psychiatrist, he was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for malaise, anorexia, poor sleep, anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt, low energy, worsening gait, and chronic joint pain; he reported no recent falls or manic symptoms.\nThe patient\u2019s psychiatric history included bipolar depression with suicide attempts and multiple psychiatric admissions, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, and skin picking. His medical history was notable for long-standing urinary incontinence, hypertension, and sleep apnea; he had undergone laser ablation of the prostate 4 years earlier, as well as bilateral inguinal hernia repair and rotator cuff repair. Medications at the time of admission included fluoxetine, lurasidone, valproic acid, aspirin, and lisinopril, as well as lorazepam and trazodone as needed. Lithium had caused tremor, aripiprazole had caused muscle rigidity and tremor, and gabapentin had caused grogginess. The patient did not smoke tobacco, and he drank alcohol less than once monthly; he had previously smoked marijuana several times daily but had been abstinent for 2 years. He was retired from employment as a laborer. He was divorced and resided in an assisted-living facility. His family history was notable for major depression in his mother and bipolar disorder in one of his children.\nThe temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/61 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.5. The patient was wheelchair-bound. He was described as well-groomed and cooperative, with appropriate eye contact. He was oriented to time, place, and person. His speech was fluent and indicated a logical thought process but was considered to be \u201cslow.\u201d Some of his responses seemed slow, but naming, repetition, attention, concentration, and memory were intact. His mood and affect were described as depressed, and he had suicidal ideation. Results of cranial nerve examination were normal, except for reduced facial expression. Motor examination showed mildly increased tone in the lower legs and left arm, with bradykinesia, and was otherwise normal. The gait was described as being \u201cslow to start\u201d with a \u201cmagnetic quality\u201d and then as \u201cshuffling\u201d for a few steps. The remainder of the neurologic and general physical examinations was normal.\nThe white-cell count, platelet count, and levels of hemoglobin, calcium, and albumin were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Glover: MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed the old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, and mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss with prominence of the ventricles and sylvian fissures. There was no abnormal enhancement. Coronal reformatted images showed a callosal angle (the angle at which the two lateral ventricles meet at the level of the posterior commissure) of 66 degrees.\nFIGURE 2\n\nAdditional MRI of the Head.\nDr. Luccarelli: Diagnostic tests were performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. D. Curtis Wegener (Neurology): A 68-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of worsening confusion and abnormal movements of the face, arms, and legs.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 9 weeks before the current presentation, when she presented to another hospital because of intermittent slurred speech and dizziness that had lasted for 1 day. The score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was obtained; the NIHSS is an 11-component tool that assesses the severity of stroke, with scores ranging from 0 to 42 and higher scores indicating more severe neurologic deficits. Her NIHSS score was 1 owing to the presence of mild-to-moderate dysarthria, and she was not considered to be a candidate for treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. Imaging studies were obtained.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed a punctate focus of restricted diffusion associated with mild signal hyperintensity involving the deep white matter of the left frontal lobe on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. This finding was consistent with an acute ischemic infarct without hemorrhage or mass effect. There were also findings that had been observed on previous imaging, including foci of encephalomalacia in the right inferior frontal lobe and left occipital lobe that were related to previous trauma, a punctate old lacunar infarct in the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere, and superimposed patchy foci of T2-weighted and FLAIR white-matter hyperintensity most consistent with small-vessel disease. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed no intracranial or cervical occlusion, high-grade stenosis, or aneurysm. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nThe patient had been taking apixaban daily because of a history of two deep venous thromboses, and the treatment was continued. She had also been taking atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and the dose was increased. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no patent foramen ovale. Continuous telemetric monitoring showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation. Mobile cardiac telemetry was planned for the 30-day period after discharge.\nOn the second hospital day, frequent irregular movements of the right leg developed, occurring every few seconds in a nonrhythmic pattern. The next day, similar movements of the right arm developed. The patient described the movements as involuntary and reported no uncontrollable urges or compulsions to move the arm or leg. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was reportedly negative for any new findings. Electroencephalography (EEG) was reportedly normal in the waking, drowsy, and light-sleep states. The dysarthria resolved, but the involuntary movements persisted. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day.\nDuring the next 6 weeks, involuntary movements involving the arms, legs, and tongue occurred with increasing frequency. The patient began using a walker. Nine days before the current presentation, the patient was again admitted to the other hospital after multiple falls at home, which she attributed to uncontrolled movements of her arms and legs. On examination, she had nearly constant writhing, nonrhythmic, dancelike movements of the arms, legs, and trunk, as well as rolling movements of the tongue. She could stand up from a chair while holding onto a walker. Scattered bruises were present on the lower legs. Imaging studies were obtained.\nCT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed mild scattered parenchymal hypodensities without hemorrhage or evidence of an acute infarct. A presumptive diagnosis of vascular chorea was made, and the patient was treated with oral levetiracetam. On the third hospital day, MRI of the head was attempted but was limited by motion artifacts due to involuntary movements. There were small foci of restricted diffusion in the right frontal and parietal periventricular white matter within the right corona radiata and centrum semiovale, findings consistent with new small acute-to-subacute infarcts without hemorrhage or mass effect.\nOn the fourth hospital day, the dose of levetiracetam was increased. EEG reportedly showed excessive irregular background slow-wave activity without focal, lateralizing, or epileptiform features; there were no findings that correlated to the movements of the head and body. On the fifth hospital day, the irregular movements had not abated, and treatment with levetiracetam was stopped. Treatment with low-dose clonazepam at bedtime was started to help with sleep. On the sixth hospital day, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\nThree days after discharge, a family member observed that the patient was confused and unable to maintain a conversation. The family member brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient was not able to provide additional information. Other medical history, obtained from the family member, included hypothyroidism, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, pulmonary hypertension, and vitiligo.\nMedications included ambrisentan, apixaban, atorvastatin, cholecalciferol, glipizide, levothyroxine, metformin, omeprazole, and sitagliptin. Clonazepam had not been administered at the rehabilitation facility. The patient had taken warfarin for many years for her history of two deep venous thromboses; 10 months before the current presentation, treatment had been switched from warfarin to apixaban. Acetylsalicylic acid had caused hives; there were no other known allergies. Before being discharged to the rehabilitation facility, the patient had lived alone in a suburban area and had worked in a school. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol rarely. Her father and brother had diabetes mellitus; there was no family history of abnormal movements or stroke.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, the pulse 79 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.6. The patient was sleepy but arousable with verbal stimuli. She was oriented to self but not to time or place. She could follow simple commands with repeated instructions but could not follow complex commands. She had irregular spontaneous movements of the face, mouth, and tongue; she also had irregular spontaneous writhing movements of the arms and legs that were partially suppressible. When she was asked to hold her arms outstretched with the palms facing upward while keeping her eyes closed, her right arm drifted downward, and the palm pronated toward the floor. Strength was 4 out of 5 on right shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, elbow extension, wrist flexion, and wrist extension; the remainder of the examination was normal.\nBlood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Urinalysis showed trace ketones and 1+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative); the urine sediment showed 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 44 mm per hour (reference range for women in the patient\u2019s age group, 0 to 40).

Foci were scattered throughout the cortex and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. The most prominent foci were located along the left temporo-occipital junction. Numerous foci involved the cortex of the frontal and parietal lobes along the precentral and postcentral gyri. There was a small punctate focus of restricted diffusion associated with T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperintensity in the right superior cerebellar hemisphere, a finding consistent with an additional small infarct. There was no associated hemorrhage or mass effect.

    "user_input": "Dr. Andrew F. Cohen (Pediatrics): A 10-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of vomiting, weight loss, and hypercalcemia.\nThe patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when projectile vomiting began to occur once every few days, typically after eating solid foods. The vomiting did not seem to bother the patient, and he immediately returned to his normal activity after each episode. During the subsequent 12 days, the vomiting became more frequent, occurring daily, and had begun to occur after drinking liquids as well.\nTwo days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the pediatric primary care clinic of this hospital. On examination, the weight was 7.36 kg (0.4th percentile for his age) (Figure 1). The patient appeared alert, attentive, and comfortable but thin. The abdomen was soft, without distention or tenderness, and there was no evidence of organomegaly or masses on palpation. The skin was diffusely dry with excoriations. Treatment with omeprazole was started.\nFIGURE 1\n\nGrowth Curves.\nOver the course of the next 2 days, the patient lost interest in eating solid food and preferred milk and water. He gagged at the sight of food. The frequency of the vomiting had increased, occurring after the patient ate or drank anything.\nOn the day of this admission, the patient refused to take any food by mouth. His parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival, his parents reported that in the previous 2 weeks, he had had normal activity, wet diapers, and daily soft stools. They also noted that he always seemed thirsty, and when given liquid, he would drink a lot. At times, he would even suck the water out of the washcloths that were used to bathe him.\nThe patient had been born after induction of labor at 38 weeks\u2019 gestation owing to maternal gestational hypertension. He had received routine newborn care and met normal developmental milestones. He maintained normal growth for his age until an evaluation at 9 months of age, when the weight was 7.44 kg (1.6th percentile), and the body length was 68.2 cm (6.5th percentile) (Figure 1). At a routine evaluation when he was 6 months of age, the weight was 7.39 kg (27.1st percentile), and the length was 66.7 cm (43.1st percentile). The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and eczema. Medications included omeprazole; he was not receiving any vitamins or supplements. He had no known drug allergies, and immunizations were up to date.\nThe patient lived with his mother and father in a suburban area of New England. His father had GERD and melanoma, and cardiomyopathy had led to heart transplantation 9 years earlier. His mother was well. The patient\u2019s paternal grandmother had the Lynch syndrome and hyperparathyroidism. His maternal grandmother had diabetes and coronary artery disease, his maternal grandfather had hypertension and eczema, and his maternal uncle had the DiGeorge syndrome.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 102/78 mm Hg, the pulse 140 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute. The patient was alert and appropriately interactive. He appeared thin. The abdomen was soft, and there was no distension or tenderness. The muscle tone was normal.\nThe blood calcium level was 13.2 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]).

    "user_input": "Dr. Benjamin D. Medoff: A 70-year-old woman was evaluated at the pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of increasing dyspnea on exertion and abnormal findings on chest imaging.\nIn childhood, the patient had eczema, recurrent episodes of bronchitis with a cough productive of mucus, and allergic rhinitis; these conditions abated in adulthood. Twenty years before this evaluation, she had community-acquired pneumonia. Fifteen years before this evaluation, she had an inhalation exposure to aerosolized brick and mortar at a construction site near her home; she subsequently had bronchitis that was treated with a course of nebulizers and inhaled glucocorticoids.\nTwelve years before this evaluation, the patient began to have episodes of coryza, nasal congestion, itchy and watery eyes, and wheezing, especially in the spring or with exposure to cats, dogs, or dust. She was seen by an allergist. Skin-prick testing elicited a response to dust mites, and intradermal testing elicited a response to tree mix and dog dander. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Presumptive diagnoses of asthma and seasonal and environmental allergies were made.

Ten years before this evaluation, the patient was seen by her primary care physician because of several weeks of nonproductive cough, nasal congestion, and intermittent wheezing; she received prescriptions for oral loratadine and inhaled pirbuterol, to be taken as needed. Eight years before this evaluation, she was referred to an allergist. She was considered to have a cough in response to angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme inhibitors. Six years 3 months before this evaluation, she consulted with another allergist. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. The blood IgE level was 1532 kU per liter (reference range at other institution, <127), with positive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, and dust mites. Inhaled fluticasone was prescribed. Three months later, she had mild dyspnea on exertion and occasional wheezing. Pulmonary-function tests showed minimal change (Table 1); inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol was prescribed.\nFive years 9 months before this evaluation, the patient was referred for pulmonary consultation. She reported intermittent wheezing, mild exertional dyspnea after climbing two flights of stairs or carrying groceries, occasional gastroesophageal reflux, and snoring. The heart rate was 72 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while she was breathing ambient air at rest. Examination revealed upper-airway wheezing and was otherwise normal. After the patient climbed four flights of stairs, the heart rate was 102 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while she was breathing ambient air. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hemoglobin were normal, as was the platelet count; the white-cell count was 11,900 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000) and the eosinophil count was 390 per microliter (reference range, <600), with a relative eosinophil count of 3.2% (reference range, 0 to 3). Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels were undetectable.\nDr. Amita Sharma: Chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation, as well as several lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis.\nDr. Medoff: The patient was seen by an otolaryngologist. External and fiberoptic examinations, including examination of the vocal cords, were normal. A sleep study revealed mild sleep apnea, with an apnea\u2013hypopnea index of 7.2 events per hour (reference range, <5). The patient was unable to receive supplemental oxygen at night and positive-pressure ventilation owing to side effects.\nFive years before this evaluation, the patient underwent cardiac evaluation because of ongoing dyspnea on exertion. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Results of an exercise stress test (treadmill test) were submaximal, with a maximum heart rate at 74% of the age-predicted value but without abnormal findings on electrocardiography. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Three months later, the patient attended follow-up with her pulmonologist; inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol was substituted for inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol, and weight loss was advised.\nDr. Sharma: Four years before this evaluation, repeat chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. All the findings were stable from the previous CT scan.\nDr. Medoff: The patient was seen by a second pulmonologist, and inhaled budesonide was substituted for inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol for the treatment of mild intermittent asthma. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 4 years before this evaluation are shown in Table 1. Subsequently, the patient was evaluated annually by her first pulmonologist, but after 3 years, she consulted with a third pulmonologist regarding recurrent dyspnea on exertion. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 7 months before this evaluation are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Sharma: At that time, chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and a nodule measuring 6 mm in diameter in the posterior right upper lobe, along with other, diffuse lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter.\nDr. Medoff: The blood hemoglobin level, platelet count, and white-cell count were normal; the eosinophil count was 437 per microliter, with a relative eosinophil count of 4.9%. The ANA titer was 1:1280, with a homogeneous staining pattern. The IgE level was 2685 kU per liter (reference range at other institution, <114), with positive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, dust mites, and Cladosporium herbarum. Treatment with oral montelukast and inhaled fluticasone\u2013umeclidinium\u2013vilanterol was started, along with supplemental oxygen to be used at night and with exertion. After 1 month, the patient\u2019s symptoms had not abated, and subcutaneous benralizumab was prescribed.\nThree months before this evaluation, the patient\u2019s symptoms remained unchanged. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. One month later, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography and CT revealed no areas of abnormal FDG avidity in the lungs. Eight weeks later, the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital.\nThe patient reported intermittent wheezing and progressive mild exertional dyspnea after climbing one to two flights of stairs. She had stopped playing a team aerobic sport because of difficulty breathing. The symptoms did not abate with use of the inhaler or benralizumab; they never occurred at rest. She occasionally had a nonproductive cough without hemoptysis, and she had a \u201craspy\u201d voice that had become worse in recent months. Coryza, nasal congestion, and watery eyes were not present. She had gained 15 kg during the previous 5 years.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history included eczema, hypothyroidism, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, borderline diabetes, calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, glaucoma, and colonic polyps. She had undergone tonsillectomy and multiple procedures for the treatment of nephrolithiasis, including shock-wave lithotripsy and ureteroscopy.\nMedications included oral aspirin, amlodipine, atenolol, atorvastatin, atovaquone, levothyroxine, loratadine, losartan, and montelukast, along with a multivitamin; inhaled fluticasone\u2013umeclidinium\u2013vilanterol; and subcutaneous benralizumab. Sulfa drugs had caused anaphylaxis, lisinopril had caused a cough, and macrolides had caused diarrhea.\nThe patient worked as an educator. She had no known exposure to asbestos, mold, solvents, or chemicals. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not have secondhand exposure to tobacco; she drank one glass of wine per week and did not use illicit drugs. She had traveled to coastal areas of Florida and Massachusetts, as well as other areas of New England, but she had not traveled to other areas of the United States or outside the country. The patient was married and lived in Massachusetts with her spouse. There had been no pets in her home for approximately 10 years. There were no damp areas in her home; she used a vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter and allergen-proof bedsheets.\nThe patient\u2019s family history was notable for coronary artery and peripheral artery disease in her father, a sister, and her brother; skin cancer in her mother; breast cancer in a sister; and hypertension and diabetes in multiple relatives. She had two healthy adult children. There was no history of allergic, immunologic, pulmonary, or rheumatologic disease.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 67 beats per minute, the blood pressure 142/91 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air. After she climbed two flights of stairs, the oxygen saturation was 87% while she was breathing ambient air. She had a cushingoid appearance. The nasal and oral mucosa appeared normal. There was no tracheal deviation or stridor. Lung auscultation revealed normal breath sounds. There was no clubbing or edema. Mild scattered eczematous plaques were present on the forearms and shins. There were mild Heberden\u2019s nodes but no other joint, skin, or nail abnormalities. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood hemoglobin level, white-cell count, differential count (with 0% eosinophils), platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and creatine kinase level were normal. The IgE level was 1307 IU per milliliter (reference range at this hospital, 0 to 100), and a hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel was negative. The thyrotropin level was 8.07 \u03bcIU per milliliter (reference range, 0.40 to 5.00), and the aldolase level 9.3 U per liter (reference range, <7.7). The ANA titer was 1:5120, with a homogeneous and speckled staining pattern; the anticytoplasmic antibody titer was 1:1280, with a filamentous and granular staining pattern; and ANCA testing was negative. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal.\nTen weeks after evaluation, at follow-up in the pulmonary clinic, a myositis antibody panel was negative, except for a weakly positive titer in response to anti-Ku antibodies. Tests were negative for ANCA, anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide, rheumatoid factor, and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Smith, antiribonucleoprotein, antitopoisomerase I (anti\u2013Scl-70), antimitochondrial, antithyroperoxidase, and anti\u2013histidyl\u2013transfer RNA synthase (anti\u2013Jo-1) antibodies.\nDr. Sharma: Chest CT (Figure 1A and 1B), performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed diffuse bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules, including a 6-mm nodule in the right upper lobe. There was no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, or lymphadenopathy.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Chest.\nDr. Medoff: Five days later, the patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at this hospital. A tapering course of oral prednisone was prescribed for the treatment of possible interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features.\nTen weeks after the visit with the rheumatologist, the eczematous rash had improved but dyspnea on exertion persisted during long walks. An examination in the pulmonary clinic was notable for clear lung fields and an oxygen saturation of 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Sharma: Chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, again showed extensive bilateral mosaic attenuation and numerous bilateral solid lung nodules, with the largest nodule, measuring 6 mm in diameter, located in the right upper lobe. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis or reticulation. Expiratory CT (Figure 1C and 1D) confirmed the presence of air trapping.\nDiagnostic tests were performed.",

Raju (Pediatrics): A 9-year-old boy was transferred to this hospital because of transient weakness and facial droop on the left side and slurred speech.\nThe patient had been well until 5 hours before this evaluation, when his parents observed that he had a facial droop on the left side and slurred speech. In addition, the patient noticed that his left arm and leg felt \u201climp.\u201d When he moved to get out of his bed, he could not stand on his own or grip using the left hand. There was no confusion, loss of consciousness, shaking in the arms or legs, urinary or fecal incontinence, headache, nausea, vomiting, recent illness, or trauma. The symptoms lasted approximately 2 minutes and then resolved completely. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital.\nAt the other hospital, the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and troponin were normal, as were the results of tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. Earlier in the day, the patient had become upset while visiting his grandfather, who was dying of esophageal cancer. He then played a game of hockey with a sibling; no falls or head trauma occurred. At the time that his parents observed the new neurologic symptoms, he had been lying in bed and crying profusely and inconsolably for an extended period. His parents noticed that he was gasping for air and hiccupping while crying.\nThe patient had been born by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at full term. He had met normal developmental milestones and had received routine childhood vaccinations. He had chronic gastrointestinal upset that had been attributed to anxiety. Two years earlier, he had been evaluated at the neurology clinic of another hospital because of episodes of shaking in the arms and legs, which occurred multiple times a day. The shaking occurred more frequently when the patient was excited or emotional. He was aware of the shaking; he felt an urge before each episode, and the urge was relieved after the shaking occurred. His parents were told that the shaking was stereotypy, and no diagnostic tests were performed.\nThe patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He lived with his parents and two siblings in a suburban area of New England. He attended elementary school and performed well academically, although he received tutoring for mild difficulties with reading and phonology. In addition to the history of esophageal cancer in his paternal grandfather, his father had ulcerative colitis, his mother had received a diagnosis of large-B-cell lymphoma in childhood, his sister had asthma, and his maternal grandfather had died of acute coronary syndrome at 30 years of age.\nOn evaluation, the patient appeared well developed and mildly anxious. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/64 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The face was symmetric, with normal forehead wrinkling, blinking, smiling, and cheek puffing. An evaluation of other cranial-nerve functions, sensation, power, bulk, tone, coordination, and gait was normal.\nA diagnostic test result was reviewed, and a diagnosis was made.",

She described these headaches as discomfort in the middle of her head that was associated with photophobia, phonophobia, and tinnitus. She reported that she was occasionally awakened from sleep because of headache and that the headache was always present on awakening in the morning. The headache was worse with coughing and abated with standing; treatment with ibuprofen did not reduce the discomfort.\nOne week before admission, nausea and vomiting developed, along with blurred vision when the patient looked to the left. She also reported occasional episodes of total vision loss that lasted for several seconds. When she was unable to eat food because of worsening nausea and vomiting, she presented to another hospital for evaluation. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles with hypodensity that involved the dorsal brain stem and cerebellar hemispheres (Figure 1A); a possible soft-tissue mass in the region of the fourth ventricular outlet was also observed. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Head and Spine.\nOn arrival, the patient reported ongoing headache and nausea. Other medical history included obesity and opioid use disorder, which was treated with oral buprenorphine\u2013naloxone and was complicated by relapses with injection of heroin; she last injected heroin 1 month before admission. Other medications included ibuprofen as needed. She had no known allergies. She smoked a half pack of cigarettes daily and did not drink alcohol. The patient lived in a wooded area of New England with four cats and one dog. She spent time outside, although she had become less active owing to headache. She was sexually active with one male partner and had no history of sexually transmitted infections. She had not traveled outside of New England. She had had periods of homelessness in the past, but she had not stayed in shelters. She had been incarcerated 2 years before this admission. She did not eat uncooked meat or seafood. Two paternal family members had had ovarian cancer.\nOn examination, the patient was alert, interactive, and did not appear to be in distress. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 117/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 42.6. There were track marks on the legs. The patient was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. On bedside visual field testing, she reported decreased vision in the peripheral fields and double vision on looking to the far left, which was accompanied by a left sixth-nerve palsy; papilledema was present in both eyes. The remainder of the cranial-nerve examination was normal. Tests of motor strength and sensation were normal. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count and differential count and the results of liver- and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed elevated signal hyperintensity involving the periaqueductal gray matter, dorsal midbrain, dorsal pons, superior and middle cerebellar peduncles, dentate nuclei, and cerebellar white matter (Figure 1B). There was obstructive hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Leptomeningeal enhancement was observed surrounding the brain stem and extending through the inferior aspect of the posterior fossa with entrapment of the fourth ventricle (Figure 1C). There was also leptomeningeal enhancement along multiple upper and lower cranial nerves.\nDr. Clark: Treatment with intravenous acetazolamide and oral dexamethasone was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the neurocritical care unit. On the first hospital day, the patient underwent stereotactically guided endoscopic exploration of the right ventricle. The right foramen of Monro was patent, but there was obstruction in the underlying third ventricle due to adhesions and aberrant anatomical features that precluded endoscopic third ventriculostomy. An external ventricular drain was placed; the opening pressure was 10 cm of water. Analysis of a CSF specimen obtained from the external ventricular drain showed 2 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 90% were neutrophils and 10% were monocytes, and 768 red cells per microliter (reference value, 0); the CSF levels of protein and glucose were normal.\nDexamethasone therapy was discontinued, and treatment with intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone was initiated. Airborne precautions were instituted, and an induced sputum sample was obtained for mycobacterial culture. No acid-fast bacilli were observed on examination of smears of three sputum samples obtained sequentially, and polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of one of the samples for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. CSF cultures were negative, and cytologic examination of the CSF did not show malignant cells.\nDr. Rohatgi: On the third hospital day, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. On the fourth hospital day, MRI of the spine revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, most notably in the lumbar spine, with masslike confluent enhancement filling the subarachnoid space at L5\u2013S2 (Figure 1F).\nDr. Clark: On the fifth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed; the CSF analysis revealed 1120 nucleated cells, of which 77% were neutrophils, and 23 red cells. The CSF protein level was 740 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the glucose level 19 mg per deciliter (1.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). The opening pressure was 10 cm of water relative to the external auditory meatus, which was the same as the pressure that was simultaneously recorded from the clamped external ventricular drain.

Price: A chest radiograph showed faint nodular opacities in the lungs, predominantly in the upper lobes. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple fluid-filled small-bowel loops with associated mild mesenteric edema and trace ascites. There was no biliary dilatation. In addition, there were numerous hypoattenuating hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement.\nDr. Gumuser: The patient was admitted to the other hospital with a diagnosis of possible small-bowel obstruction and pneumonia. Treatment with intravenous fluids and ceftriaxone, oral doxycycline, and bowel rest was initiated. On the second hospital day, additional imaging studies of the liver were obtained.\nDr. Price: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen (Figure 1), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilobar hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement, high T2 signal, and diffusion restriction.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Gumuser: Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture, and treatment with intravenous metronidazole was initiated. On the third hospital day, the abdominal pain had resolved, and the patient began drinking clear fluids. On the fourth hospital day, ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was performed. While the results of the liver biopsy were pending, the patient resumed a normal diet, with no recurrence of abdominal pain. Treatment with oral doxycycline and intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole was continued.\nDr. Price: On the sixth hospital day, CT of the chest (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed numerous irregular cysts and cavitary nodules in the lungs, which were most pronounced in the upper lobes, as well as solid and subsolid parenchymal nodules that measured less than 1.0 cm in diameter. There were multiple nodules in the thyroid gland, measuring up to 2.8 cm in diameter in the inferior left thyroid lobe. There was a 1.7-cm nodule with soft-tissue attenuation in the right breast.\nDr. Gumuser: On the eighth hospital day, bronchoscopy was performed. The airways were inspected to the segmental level, and no abnormalities were visualized. Transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in the right upper lobe. Examination of the BAL fluid revealed 321 white cells per microliter (reference range, 94 to 175). Gram\u2019s staining and examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear of the BAL fluid were negative.\nOn the ninth hospital day, results of the liver biopsy became available, showing extensive eosinophilic infiltration of the liver parenchyma with associated moderate steatosis. Staining of the biopsy specimen for microorganisms, including mycobacteria, was negative. Cultures of blood obtained on the second hospital day showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further care.\nOn arrival, the patient reported a mild sore throat that had developed after bronchoscopy, but there was no abdominal pain. She had lost 2 kg of weight before the hospitalization, in the context of dietary changes. She had no history of fever but reported a several-year history of mild shortness of breath with walking that she attributed to smoking. Her surgical history included cholecystectomy and cesarean section. Results of a Papanicolaou test performed 3 months before this presentation had been normal; the patient had not undergone mammography or colonoscopy. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived in an urban area of New England. She was born in Portugal and had immigrated to the United States 40 years earlier. She had not traveled recently; her last trip had been to Portugal 25 years before this admission. The patient was divorced, lived alone, and worked in a medical laboratory. She had no known exposure to chemicals or dust; a coworker at a previous office job had had an atypical infection attributed to mold in the workplace. She had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. She drank alcohol three times a week and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from colon cancer at 43 years of age.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 130/64 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

Chwalisz: A 65-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of bilateral eye pain and decreased vision.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 days before this admission, when constant aching pain developed in the left eye and the left side of the head. During the next few days, the vision in the left eye gradually became blurry. Three days before this admission, redness developed in the right eye. The patient used tetrahydrozoline eye drops, but symptoms did not abate. One day before this admission, pain developed in the right eye that was similar to the pain in the left eye. The patient sought evaluation by his primary care physician, who recommended that he present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival, the patient rated the eye pain and headache at 2 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain was not worse with eye movement or accompanied by flashing lights, floaters, or discharge. The patient reported no trauma but noted weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past 2 weeks, as well as pain with chewing food. He did not have scalp tenderness, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, numbness, weakness, or slurred speech.\nThe patient had a history of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia, which had been diagnosed 2 years before this admission and treated with plasmapheresis, dexamethasone, and four cycles of bortezomib (with discontinuation of bortezomib after 4 months because of peripheral neuropathy), as well as six cycles of bendamustine. During the 9 months that followed the completion of treatment with bendamustine, there was active surveillance of the blood IgM level. One month before this admission, the IgM level was 1001 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334), and biopsy of the bone marrow revealed persistent disease. One week before this admission, the patient took his first dose of ibrutinib, which had been prescribed 3 months earlier.\nOther medical history included latent tuberculosis, depression, anxiety, prediabetes, folate deficiency, and seasonal allergies. Medications included ibrutinib, isoniazid, pyridoxine, sertraline, citalopram, hydroxyzine, cetirizine, fluticasone nasal spray, and a multivitamin. Rituximab had caused anaphylaxis. The patient did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. He was originally from Central America and had immigrated to the United States 50 years earlier; 1 month earlier, he had moved from the West Coast to an urban area of New England. He lived in an apartment with his niece and cousins and worked in construction. His family history was unknown.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 104/69 mm Hg, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye with correction. On confrontation testing, visual fields in the left eye were deficient in the inferior temporal and nasal aspects. On the Ishihara color test, all plates were identified with the right eye but only the control plate was identified with the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the left eye. There was no proptosis. Subconjunctival hemorrhage was present in the right eye; pterygia were present in both eyes. On funduscopic examination, the optic disk in the left eye was edematous. Results of tests of cranial nerve function, power, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait were normal.\nThe blood hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), the hematocrit 39.8% (reference range, 41.0 to 53.0), the white-cell count 8090 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), and the platelet count 131,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000).

He was treated with a wide local excision; a biopsy of the sentinel lymph node was negative for melanoma. One year before the current evaluation, the patient began to have slurred speech and weakness in the left hand. Imaging revealed a mass lesion in the parietal lobe of the brain and another mass in the hilum of the left lung. Craniotomy with resection of the brain mass was performed; pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with melanoma, as did a biopsy of the lung mass. Seizures developed postoperatively, and treatment with levetiracetam was initiated. Further treatment included radiation therapy targeting the parietal resection cavity and the administration of pembrolizumab.\nFour months before the current evaluation, after seven cycles of pembrolizumab, the blood thyrotropin level was 9.4 \u03bcIU per milliliter (reference range, 0.4 to 5.0) and the free thyroxine level 0.9 ng per deciliter (12 pmol per liter; reference range, 0.9 to 1.8 ng per deciliter [12 to 23 pmol per liter]); treatment with levothyroxine was initiated. Three months before the current evaluation, after eight cycles of pembrolizumab, exertional angina developed, and the patient underwent coronary catheterization with placement of two drug-eluting stents. Pembrolizumab treatment was resumed 1 month later.\nWhen the patient presented to the oncology clinic for a planned infusion of pembrolizumab, he reported a 3-week history of fatigue and a 2-week history of increased thirst and nocturia, with a need to urinate as many as three times each night.

Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal; urine protein electrophoresis revealed polyclonal light-chain bands.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults, First Hospital), On Admission (First Hospital, 7 Mo Before This Admission), Reference Range (Adults, Second Hospital), On Admission (Second Hospital, 9 Days Before This Admission), Reference Range (Adults, This Hospital), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nBlood\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.7\u201316.7, 12.3, 13.8\u201317.4, 10.6, 13.5\u201317.5, 9.2\nHematocrit (%), 38.1\u201350.1, 36.4, 41.0\u201351.0, 30.7, 41.0\u201353.0, 26.8\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 3800\u201310,050, 2120, 4400\u201311,300, 3000, 4500\u201311,000, 2740\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l)\nNeutrophils, \u2014, 1187, \u2014, 2790, 1800\u20137700, 2512\nLymphocytes, \u2014, 487, \u2014, 60, 1000\u20134800, 79\nMonocytes, \u2014, 402, \u2014, 90, 200\u20131200, 128\nEosinophils, \u2014, 0, \u2014, 0, 0\u2013900, 0\nImmature granulocytes, \u2014, 21, \u2014, 60, 0\u2013100, 19\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 125,000, 150,000\u2013450,000, 92,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 58,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 134\u2013145, 133, 134\u2013145, 135, 135\u2013145, 142\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.5\u20135.1, 4.0, 3.5\u20135.1, 4.4, 3.4\u20135.0, 3.3\nChloride (mmol/liter), 96\u2013108, 98, 96\u2013108, 96, 98\u2013108, 104\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 22\u201332, 19, 22\u201332, 21, 23\u201332, 22\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201328, 54, 8\u201328, 55, 8\u201325, 47\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.5\u20131.2, 3.2, 0.5\u20131.2, 3.4, 0.60\u20131.50, 2.96\nGlucose (mg/dl), 74\u2013118, 97, 74\u2013118, 96, 70\u2013110, 89\nPhosphorous (mg,dl), \nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 11.9, 8.5\u201310.5, 9.6, 8.5\u201310.5, 9.8\n25-Hydroxyvitamin D (ng/ml), 30\u2013100, 20, 30\u2013100, 20, 20\u201380, 25\nParathyroid hormone (pg/ml), 15\u201365, <6, 15\u201365, 17, 10\u201360, 7\nParathyroid hormone\u2013related peptide (pmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 3.5\n1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (pg/ml), 19.9\u201379.3, 71.8, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.2\u20137.9, 6.9, 6.2\u20137.9, 6.1, 6.0\u20138.3, 5.8\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.4\u20135.2, 3.9, 3.4\u20135.2, 3.6, 3.3\u20135.0, 3.1\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 0\u201365, 68, 0\u201365, 34, 10\u201355, 47\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 0\u201343, 89, 0\u201343, 27, 10\u201340, 23\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 29\u2013126, 259, 29\u2013126, 104, 45\u2013115, 138\nBone-specific alkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 6.5\u201320.1, 21.6, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014\nThyrotropin (\u00b5IU/ml), 0.27\u20134.20, 8.74, 0.30\u20134.50, 2.16, 0.4\u20135.0, 5.83\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201315, 13, \u2014, \u2014, 0\u201313, 46\nVitamin B12 (pg/ml), \u2014, \u2014, 300\u20132000, 201, >250, 738\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), \u2014, \u2014, <5.0, 54.4, <8.0, 140.0\nIron (\u00b5g/dl), \u2014, \u2014, 50\u2013160, 66, 45\u2013160, 13\nTotal iron-binding capacity (\u00b5g/dl), \u2014, \u2014, 250\u2013430, 178, 230\u2013404, 159\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), \u2014, \u2014, 41\u2013306, 776, 20\u2013300, 805\n\nUrine\nColor, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow\nClarity, Clear, Slightly cloudy, Clear, Clear, Clear, Clear\npH, 5.0\u20137.5, 5.0, 5.0\u20139.0, 6.0, 5.0\u20139.0, 5.0\nSpecific gravity, 1.001\u20131.035, 1.011, 1.001\u20131.035, 1.009, 1.001\u20131.035, 1.009\nGlucose, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative\nKetones, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative\nLeukocyte esterase, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, +1\nNitrite, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative\nProtein, Negative, 30 mg/dl, Negative, 30 mg/dl, Negative, Negative\nBlood, Negative, Large, Negative, Negative, Negative, Negative\nRed cells (per high-power field), 0\u20132, >100, <2, 1, 0\u20132, 0\u20132\nWhite cells (per high-power field), <10, 0\u20135, <4, 6, 0\u20132, 5\u201310\nBacteria, None, Rare, None, Negative, None, None\n\nDr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed focal nodular soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta. Splenomegaly and left paraaortic adenopathy were present. Small pulmonary nodules and patchy consolidation were observed, along with a small left pleural effusion.\nDr. Matza: After treatment with intravenous normal saline and furosemide, the calcium level normalized and the creatinine level decreased to 2.3 mg per deciliter (203 mmol per liter). The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day.\nDr. Rory K. Crotty: A bone marrow biopsy performed 2 weeks later at the first hospital revealed hypercellular marrow and multiple nonnecrotizing granulomas. Staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungi was negative. No cultures were obtained.\nDr. Matza: The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 89 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 67). A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered, and therapy with high-dose oral prednisone was started.\nOne month later, the ACE level decreased to 41 U per liter, and the patient\u2019s energy level and appetite improved. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone were unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea.\nThree months later, the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the first hospital for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was initiated for prophylaxis against pneumocystis while the patient continued to receive high-dose prednisone. Tests of pulmonary function showed mild obstruction, with a clinically significant response after the use of a bronchodilator, and moderate restriction, with moderately reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. A second attempt to taper the dose of prednisone was unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea.\nDuring the next 2 months, intermittent confusion, progressive weakness in the legs, right foot drop, and increasing unsteadiness and gait instability developed; the patient began to use a walker to ambulate. He also had at least two falls. He required help from his wife to perform activities of daily living, including bathing and dressing.\nThe patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at the first hospital. Complement levels were normal, as was the level of rheumatoid factor. Tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Weekly treatment with oral methotrexate and folic acid was started for presumed sarcoidosis.\nEleven days later, the patient presented to a second hospital with a new facial droop on the left side, slurred speech, and confusion. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/86 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 63 kg and the BMI 21.9. The patient was oriented to person, place, and time; neurologic examination was notable for a mild facial droop on the left side, mildly increased muscle tone, right foot drop, and symmetric mild weakness in the arms and upper legs. Cachexia, tachycardia, and splenomegaly were noted. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a 12-mm right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm, a right cerebellar cavernous malformation, and numerous punctate foci (in the pons, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus) characterized by hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging and restricted diffusion.\nDr. Matza: Clopidogrel and levetiracetam were initiated. Echocardiography did not show intracardiac thrombus or shunting; carotid ultrasonography did not show stenosis. Electromyography revealed evidence of mild L5\u2013S1 radiculopathy and right ulnar and median neuropathy, but there was no evidence of myopathy or upper motor neuron disease. Owing to progressive leukopenia (white-cell count, 1390 per microliter) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 51,000 per microliter), methotrexate, clopidogrel, levetiracetam, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole were discontinued; cyanocobalamin was started.\nOn the fourth hospital day, a fever with a temperature of 38.3\u00b0C developed; specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were initiated. The C-reactive protein level was 101.8 mg per liter. Blood tests for ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid factor, influenza type A and B antigens, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen, antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core antibodies, cytomegalovirus DNA, Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA, and parvovirus IgM were negative, as were urine tests for legionella antigen and histoplasma antigen. A rapid plasma reagin test was negative, and an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was reported as indeterminate.\nDr. Shepard: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed scattered ground-glass opacities in the lungs, nodular and consolidative opacities in the lungs, mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, small pleural effusions, and splenomegaly (with the spleen measuring 16 cm in the cephalocaudad dimension; normal length, <13 cm). Focal soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta and prominence of the soft tissue surrounding the infrarenal abdominal aorta were also noted.\nThe next day, magnetic resonance angiography was performed. A T2-weighted fat-saturated image (Figure 1A) showed signal hyperintensity in the soft tissue around the infrarenal aorta and in the adjacent left paraaortic lymph nodes that was indicative of adenopathy, with a focal abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm seen on time-of-flight imaging (Figure 1B).\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Chest.\nDr. Matza: On the eighth hospital day, a bone marrow biopsy was performed. On the ninth day, the patient was transferred to this hospital.\nOn the patient\u2019s arrival, a review of systems was limited owing to delirium, and history was obtained in part from the patient\u2019s family. The review was notable for months of fatigue, malaise, leg weakness, right foot drop, waxing and waning confusion, exertional dyspnea, and an inability to walk and perform activities of daily living. Palpitations, dry cough, easy bruising, and irritable bladder were present, but he had no chills, anorexia, joint pain, erythema, rashes, nodules, myalgia, chest pain, dizziness, productive cough, hemoptysis, orthopnea, wheezing, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysuria, hematuria, ocular or nasal symptoms, skin or nail changes, or headache.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for hypothyroidism, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, progressive kidney disease, degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, scoliosis, tubular adenoma, and leukopenia. Eight years before this admission, a mass in the bladder that measured 4.5 cm by 4.0 cm was noted on ultrasonography, which had been performed for evaluation of hematuria. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed at another hospital, but the resection was reportedly incomplete. Histologic examination revealed non\u2013muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma. Repeat cystoscopy and transurethral resection, performed 3, 8, and 16 months after the initial procedures, each revealed fragments of non\u2013muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, and intravesical bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) was administered. Cystoscopy, performed 1 year before this admission for the management of bladder stones, identified a recurrent polypoid bladder tumor, which was treated with transurethral resection.\nOutpatient medications included prednisone, methotrexate, folic acid, aspirin, levothyroxine, simvastatin, tamsulosin, cholecalciferol, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, omeprazole, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, fluticasone\u2013salmeterol, and as-needed inhaled albuterol. Penicillin had caused an unknown reaction.\nThe patient was a retired pharmacist and lived with his wife. He had a remote history of smoking a half pack of cigarettes daily for 2 years and drank alcohol infrequently. He had not traveled recently and had had no environmental, animal, or toxic exposures. There was no family history of autoimmune, neurologic, infectious, or pulmonary disorders.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/76 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 54 kg and the BMI 18.8. He was anxious, cachectic, and appeared chronically ill. He correctly reported his name, location, and the time and date; however, he was unable to follow simple two-step commands. The cranial-nerve examination revealed a subtle facial droop on the left side. There were tremors in the arms and legs at rest and with motion, as well as right foot drop and diffusely increased tone. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing showed dysmetria. Bibasilar crackles (greater in the left lung than in the right) were heard on lung auscultation. Hepatosplenomegaly was present. There were diffuse ecchymoses on the trunk, arms, and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe international normalized ratio and blood levels of ammonia, bilirubin, creatine kinase, folic acid, globulin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, lactic acid, and magnesium were normal. The ACE level was 36 U per liter (reference range, 8 to 53). Serum protein electrophoresis showed no bands, but a mild, diffuse decrease in globulin was noted. The urine free kappa light-chain level was 134.2 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.4 to 15.1), and the urine free lambda light-chain level was 35.6 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.8 to 10.1), with a normal ratio (3.77; reference range, 0.50 to 4.00). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. During the first 3 days of this admission, the patient became lethargic; when he was awakened, his speech was incoherent and dysarthric.\nDr. Schaefer: On the third hospital day, MRI of the head (Figure 2) with magnetic resonance angiography revealed a stable right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm, as well as a stable right cerebellar cavernous malformation. There were punctate and patchy foci characterized by hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging and restricted diffusion in the midbrain, pons, medulla, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus; the foci had increased in size and extent from the previous study.\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Shepard: Positron-emission tomography (PET)\u2013CT (Figure 1D through 1F) revealed multiple foci of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in periaortic soft tissue and paraaortic lymph nodes, in the axial skeleton (cervical vertebral body, ribs, manubrium, and sacrum), and in the left testis.\nDr. Matza: Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan, coxiella antibodies, cytomegalovirus IgM and IgG, cryptococcal antigen, human chorionic gonadotropin, and Treponema pallidum antibodies were negative, as was a urine test for histoplasma antigen. Electroencephalographic monitoring showed frequent sharp, irregular delta and theta discharges; treatment with levetiracetam was started.\nOn the fourth hospital day, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C. Ultrasound images showed testes of normal size and echotexture without focal lesions, but the epididymides were enlarged and heterogeneous. The kidneys were normal in size, with diffusely echogenic parenchyma, and a 19-mm bladder stone was present. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function, no evidence of clinically significant valvular disease, and a mildly dilated aorta. Flow cytometry showed a markedly reduced CD4+ T-cell count (11 per microliter; reference range, 348 to 1456). Antibody tests for bartonella and brucella were negative.\nSomnolence progressed, and on the fifth hospital day, the right pupil was noted to be slightly larger than the left and the patient had increased tremor. Fosphenytoin therapy was initiated, and he was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit. The oxygen saturation declined to 90% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute, and a Cheyne\u2013Stokes pattern of respiration was observed. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated.\nA diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Stephanie Lin-Beckford (Medicine): A 37-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a rash.\nThe patient had been well until 9 days before this admission, when a diffuse rash developed on the hands and feet. During the next 3 days, the rash spread proximally to the arms and the legs, then extended to the groin, trunk, and face. Six days before this admission, the patient noticed new throat tightness and lip swelling. Three days before this admission, when difficulty with swallowing and shortness of breath developed, the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital.\nOn evaluation at the other hospital, the patient reported that he had received an mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine on the day before the rash appeared. Vital signs and results of routine laboratory tests were reportedly normal. Treatment with dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, famotidine, and intravenous fluids was administered. The patient was discharged home.\nDuring the next 3 days, the symptoms did not abate. On the day of this admission, the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. He described having difficulty with opening his mouth because of pain in his lips, as well as mild difficulty with swallowing and breathing. The rash had become more confluent over the arms, legs, chest, back, face, and groin, and there was increased redness and swelling. The patient described the rash as mildly itchy and painful and stated that the affected skin felt \u201ctight.\u201d A review of systems was notable for fatigue, malaise, chills, and night sweats, as well as intermittent nausea, abdominal pain, watery stools, and dysuria. He had no fever, headache, cough, myalgias, or arthralgias.\nThe patient had no known medical conditions, took no medications, and had no known drug allergies. He was born in coastal South America and had immigrated to the United States 17 years before this admission. He lived in suburban New England with extended family members and had no pets; he had not traveled recently and had no known sick contacts. The patient worked in environmental services and wore gloves whenever he used cleaning products. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years; he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He was sexually active and reported that his last episode of unprotected sexual intercourse had been with a female partner 2 years before this admission. No family members had autoimmune diseases or skin conditions.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 105 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/92 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was fissuring at the oral commissures, and the posterior oropharynx had a cobblestone appearance; no mucosal lesions were noted. There was no conjunctival injection. The lungs were clear on auscultation. No joint swelling or cervical lymphadenopathy was present, but he had nontender bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Morbilliform macules, papules, and plaques were observed on the arms, legs, chest, back, face, scalp, groin, and penis (Figure 1). The rash became confluent at the dorsa and palms of the hands and at the dorsa and soles of the feet. No skin sloughing, erosions, ulcers, vesicles, or bullae were present. The complete blood count, blood levels of electrolytes, and results of tests of kidney and liver function were normal. The C-reactive protein level was 16.7 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 30 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13). Urinalysis was normal.

    "user_input": "Dr. Emily W. Lopes: A 53-year-old woman with celiac disease was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital for the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with hemorrhagic shock.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 3 weeks before the current presentation, when fatigue, malaise, anorexia, generalized weakness, and watery diarrhea developed. Two weeks later, the diarrhea increased in frequency and became bloody. The patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 63/32 mm Hg, the hemoglobin level 6.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), the international normalized ratio 7.63 (reference range, 0.90 to 1.10), the creatinine level 1.4 mg per deciliter (124 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.5 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [44 to 115 \u03bcmol per liter]), the alkaline phosphatase level 330 U per liter (reference range, 56 to 136), the albumin level 1.4 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.5), and the lactate level 3.3 mmol per liter (30 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]). Normal saline, albumin, norepinephrine, fresh-frozen plasma, vitamin K, 4 units of packed red cells, vancomycin, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, octreotide, and pantoprazole were administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of oral contrast material, reportedly revealed ground-glass opacities in the lungs, pulmonary nodules, esophageal dilatation, and diffuse osteopenia, along with ascites, hepatic steatosis, diffuse bowel-wall thickening, dilated loops of small bowel, and horseshoe kidney. A heterogeneous mass, measuring 11 cm by 8 cm by 7 cm, with internal necrosis was identified near the pancreatic tail. Abdominal ultrasonography reportedly showed a cirrhotic-appearing liver and ascites. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was reportedly notable for severe esophagitis but showed no source of acute bleeding.\nDuring the first 7 hospital days, diarrhea continued, with an output of up to 2 liters of green liquid stool daily. Examination of a stool specimen was reportedly positive for leukocytes and negative for Clostridioides difficile and Shiga toxin, as well as campylobacter, giardia, and cryptosporidium antigens.\nOn hospital day 7, anuria occurred, and the bladder pressure was 23 mm Hg. Paracentesis was performed for the treatment of abdominal distention, and 3.7 liters of ascitic fluid was removed. Testing of the ascitic fluid revealed 14,000 erythrocytes per microliter and 91 neutrophils per microliter. The albumin level in ascitic fluid was 0.3 g per deciliter; the concurrent serum albumin level was 3.2 g per deciliter. No organisms were detected on Gram\u2019s staining of the ascitic fluid. Norepinephrine and albumin were administered intravenously.\nThe next day, there was an output of copious black stool. The hemoglobin level decreased from 8.1 g per deciliter to 5.1 g per deciliter; additional norepinephrine was administered intravenously, along with 4 units of packed red cells, cryoprecipitate, vitamin K, and fresh-frozen plasma. Intubation of the trachea was performed for repeat EGD, which reportedly revealed a pulsatile vascular lesion in the distal esophagus; blood was detected around the lesion. Octreotide and pantoprazole were administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to the ICU of this hospital.\nBecause the patient had undergone intubation, the medical history was initially obtained from her husband and was limited. Celiac disease had been diagnosed in her late 30s, but she did not follow a gluten-free diet. Her one pregnancy had been complicated by severe gestational hypertension, with delivery by cesarean section performed at 33 weeks\u2019 gestation. Menopause had occurred in her mid-40s. Recurrent otitis media had led to tympanic membrane perforation and resultant chronic hearing loss. In the past year, she had lost 7 kg of weight unintentionally. In the 2 weeks before she was admitted to the other hospital, after the onset of diarrhea, she had had a decreased appetite and had eaten only candy and cereal, with 2 kg of weight loss.\nThe patient attended college and worked as a technical consultant. She lived with her husband. She had no history of nicotine, alcohol, or illicit substance use. She took no medications or supplements, and there were no known adverse reactions to medications. Her family history included stroke in her father, colon cancer in her paternal grandfather, and pancreatic cancer in a paternal great-grandfather and a paternal aunt. She had an adult child, who was healthy.\nOn examination in the ICU, the patient appeared chronically ill. The temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 91 beats per minute, the blood pressure 102/67 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 98% while she was receiving mechanical ventilation on a spontaneous-breathing mode (positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; fraction of inspired oxygen, 35%). The height was 142 cm, the weight 50.6 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.1. The bladder pressure was 12 mm Hg. The sclerae were icteric, and the skin was jaundiced. The corners of the mouth were inflamed, erythematous, and crusted. The abdomen was distended, and a fluid wave was present. The palmar surfaces appeared mildly erythematous and denuded, and there were pigmented nevi on the back and shoulder. Symmetric 1+ pitting edema was observed in the lower legs.\nThe calcium and phosphorus levels were normal. Tests for hepatitis A antibodies, hepatitis B surface antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigens, hepatitis B core antibodies, hepatitis C antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and liver\u2013kidney\u2013microsomal autoantibodies type 1 were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Stool was obtained for culture and examination for ova and parasites. Albumin, 2 units of packed red cells, ceftriaxone, propofol, pantoprazole, and octreotide were administered intravenously.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Admission, Hospital Day 2, Hospital Day 3\n\nBlood:\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201316.0, 13.2, 11.0, 14.7\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 38.3, 31.4, 41.1\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 15,290, 8260, 13,470\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 79,000, 71,000, 105,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 142, 142, 141\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 4.1, 3.9, 3.7\nChloride (mmol/liter), 100\u2013108, 113, 114, 113\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 13, 15, 13\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 3, 4, 5\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.53, 0.54, 0.65\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 98, 98, 69\nMagnesium (mg/dl), 1.7\u20132.4, 0.6, 1.8, 1.9\nTotal protein (g/dl), 4.3\u20138.0, 4.3, 4.3, 4.0\nLactate (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.0, 2.6, 1.7, 1.6\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 19.2, 21.9, 20.2\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.6, 1.9, 1.7\nFibrinogen (mg/dl), 150\u2013400, 192, 128, 133\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 3.2, \u2014, 3.1\nGlobulin (g/dl), 1.9\u20134.1, 1.1, \u2014, 0.9\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201333, 18, \u2014, 16\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201332, 27, \u2014, 25\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 30\u2013100, 68, \u2014, 72\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 10.1, \u2014, 6.2\nDirect bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20130.4, 4.7, \u2014, 3.9\nCA 19\u20139 (U/ml), <35, 26, \u2014, \u2014\nIron (\u00b5g/dl), 30\u2013160, \u2014, 86, \u2014\nIron-binding capacity (\u00b5g/dl), 230\u2013404, \u2014, 93, \u2014\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), 10\u2013200, \u2014, 50, \u2014\nFolate (ng/ml), >4.7, \u2014, 2.2, \u2014\nVitamin B\u2081 (nmol/liter), 70\u2013180, \u2014, 120, \u2014\nVitamin B\u2083 (\u00b5g/ml), 0.50\u20138.45, \u2014, 1.83, \u2014\nVitamin B\u2081\u2082 (pg/ml), >250, \u2014, 1960, \u2014\nIgG (mg/dl), 614\u20131295, \u2014, 412, \u2014\nIgA (mg/dl), 69\u2013309, \u2014, 140, \u2014\nIgM (mg/dl), 53\u2013334, \u2014, 56, \u2014\nSerum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation, Normal pattern; no M component, \u2014, Mild, diffuse decrease in gamma globulin; no M component, \u2014\nAntinuclear antibody, Negative at 1:80 and 1:160, \u2014, Positive at 1:40; speckled, \u2014\nAnti\u2013smooth muscle antibody, Negative at 1:20, \u2014, Positive at 1:20, \u2014\nAlpha\u2081-antitrypsin (mg/dl), 90\u2013200, \u2014, 72, \u2014\nCeruloplasmin (mg/dl), 20\u201360, \u2014, 10, \u2014\nAmmonia (\u00b5mol/liter), 12\u201348, \u2014, \u2014, 64\nAnti\u2013tissue transglutaminase IgA (U/ml), 0\u201315, \u2014, \u2014, 40.25\nAnti\u2013gliadin IgA (U/ml), 0\u201315, \u2014, \u2014, 21.19\nAntimitochondrial antibody, Negative at 1:20, \u2014, \u2014, Positive at 1:20\nCopper (\u00b5g/ml), 0.75\u20131.45, \u2014, \u2014, 0.33\nPrealbumin (mg/dl), 20\u201340, \u2014, \u2014, 5\nVitamin A (\u00b5g/dl), 32.5\u201378.0, \u2014, \u2014, <5.0\nVitamin D\u2082 (ng/ml), 20\u201380, \u2014, \u2014, 5\nVitamin E (mg/liter), 5.5\u201317.9, \u2014, \u2014, 1.0\nZinc (\u00b5g/ml), 0.66\u20131.10, \u2014, \u2014, 0.24\n\nStool:\nShiga toxins 1 and 2, Negative, Negative, \u2014, \u2014\nFat (%), <20, \u2014, <20, \u2014\nSodium (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, 88, \u2014\nPotassium (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, 17, \u2014\n\nEGD was performed the next morning (Figure 1). There was a blind-ended submucosal pouch that suggested the possibility of an intramural dissection in the posterior esophagus. Severe esophagitis, cratered esophageal ulcers, and a distal esophageal varix with an overlying fibrin plug were noted. An attempt at esophageal band ligation was unsuccessful, with unroofing of the fibrin clot and active spurting of blood. Two clips were applied for hemostasis.

    "user_input": "Dr. Rebecca Leval (Psychiatry): A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the psychiatry clinic of this hospital 4 weeks after the birth of her first child because of anxiety and intrusive thoughts.\nThe patient (gravida 1, para 1) had had gestational hypertension, for which she had not received medication; otherwise, her pregnancy had been uncomplicated. Four weeks before the current evaluation, she went into labor at 39 weeks 1 day\u2019s gestation and gave birth to a healthy male infant by spontaneous vaginal delivery in the labor and delivery unit of this hospital. Skin-to-skin contact, in which the infant is placed on the bare chest of the mother, was started immediately after the baby was born. During the next 2 days, the patient was engaged and inquisitive during postpartum counseling and education. She was able to initiate breast-feeding and appeared to be bonding appropriately with the infant. On the fourth hospital day, she was discharged home.\nAt home, the patient breast-fed the infant but noticed that he had a poor latch. One day after discharge, the patient called the obstetrics clinic of this hospital to request lactation advice. She also described having difficulty sleeping and feeling anxious and nervous since giving birth. The patient was advised to start pumping breast milk in addition to breast-feeding. Treatment with sertraline was initiated.\nThree weeks before the current evaluation, the patient called the obstetrics clinic again for advice regarding the use of the breast pump. She was also concerned that the difficulties with breast-feeding were interfering with bonding with the infant, and she noted that her blood pressure, which she had measured with an ambulatory monitor at home, was 164/101 mm Hg. The patient was advised to seek evaluation in the labor and delivery unit of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient described insomnia, anxiety, painful nipples, decreased appetite, and mild headache. She reported no blurred vision or abdominal pain. The blood pressure was 140/84 mm Hg and the pulse 107 beats per minute. The patient appeared worried and anxious. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of kidney and liver function. The urinalysis was normal. Treatment with nifedipine was initiated for hypertension, along with lorazepam as needed for anxiety. Sertraline therapy was continued. The patient was discharged home.\nThe next day, the patient awoke and told her husband, \u201cI can\u2019t go on like this. I can\u2019t do this anymore. I can\u2019t wake up feeling like this again.\u201d He called the obstetrics clinic and was instructed to bring her to the labor and delivery unit. On evaluation, the patient stated that she had stopped breast-feeding because of bleeding of the nipples and had started feeding with formula. She felt exhausted and \u201cemotionally numb,\u201d and she sometimes could not remember whether she had fed the baby. She described feeling lonely, isolated, distressed, and unable to engage in most child care duties. The patient\u2019s mother had been visiting her and her husband to assist them with child care.\nThe patient reported that, during the pregnancy, she had been excited and had felt \u201cready and prepared,\u201d although somewhat nervous in anticipation of the delivery. She had not felt traumatized after the pregnancy or delivery, but when she had returned home, she felt \u201chit by a ton of trains.\u201d She would awaken frequently during the night when the infant made noises. When the infant was quiet, the patient was unable to sleep because of racing thoughts and feeling overwhelmed. She said, \u201cThe idea of being this baby\u2019s mother for the rest of my life is too much for me to handle. I don\u2019t want to do this now or for the rest of my life.\u201d She added, \u201cI wish I were dead sometimes\u201d but reported no active suicidal or homicidal ideation or plan.\nThe patient had a history of intermittent insomnia and migraines. She had had dysthymic symptoms as a teenager when she had moved to the United States from Central America, and she had had mild generalized anxiety and anxiety with public speaking during college, for which she had taken propranolol. She had had no previous suicidal or homicidal ideation or history of self-harm behaviors, and she had never had a psychiatric admission or intensive psychiatric treatment. The patient took prenatal vitamins, nifedipine, and sertraline. She also took lorazepam as needed for anxiety, acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for headaches, and docusate for constipation. There were no known drug allergies. She was on maternity leave from her work as an administrator, and she lived in suburban New England with her infant and husband. She felt safe and supported in the home. The patient drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Her mother had migraines, her father hypertension and anxiety, her brother anxiety, her maternal grandmother hematologic cancer, and her paternal grandmother hypertension. Her maternal grandfather had died of lung cancer and her paternal grandfather of a stroke.\nOn the day of the current evaluation, the patient presented to this hospital to establish care with a psychiatrist. On evaluation, the patient repeatedly said, \u201cThe baby is a good baby\u201d and stated that she did not want to hurt the infant or other people; however, she described intrusive thoughts of stabbing the infant and had visual hallucinations of herself holding a knife. She noted that the thoughts had started after delivery and had become increasingly vivid and frequent. They caused distress and anxiety and led to episodes of intense crying, rapid breathing, and feeling shaky. She avoided the kitchen because knives were present, and she had stopped cooking \u2014 an activity that she had previously enjoyed. The patient did not feel comfortable holding or feeding the infant because of the unwanted, intrusive thoughts and thus avoided physical contact with him. However, she checked on him every few minutes to make sure that he was alive and breathing and frequently asked her husband whether the infant was OK. The patient repeatedly searched on the internet looking for reassurance that she would not act on these thoughts. She contacted other mothers online and talked to her husband and mother to seek reassurance that she was not \u201ca bad mother.\u201d However, she had not told them or her clinicians about the intrusive thoughts because she was terrified that the infant would be taken away from her.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 138/83 mm Hg and the pulse 68 beats per minute. The patient was tearful and appeared exhausted. Her mood was anxious and dysphoric, and her affect was restricted and congruent with her mood. She did not have disorganized thinking, delusional content, or perceptual disturbances.\nA diagnosis was made.",

The right kidney was partially visualized and had two cysts, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter; the left kidney was not seen. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (Figure 1B and 1C) showed a normal-appearing liver, biliary system, and spleen. The pancreatic head and neck were smaller than expected, and the body and tail of the pancreas were absent. There were multiple bilateral simple kidney cysts, ranging in size from 2 to 18 mm.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Tan: After these imaging studies were obtained, the patient did not return for scheduled follow-up in the gastroenterology clinic. One year later, and 1 week before the current presentation, the patient returned for follow-up. He had no symptoms, and the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The MRCP findings were unchanged from the previous evaluation. The patient was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospital for evaluation of his kidney cysts.\nIn the nephrology clinic, the patient reported that he felt well. He had had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccinations. Medications included insulin degludec and insulin lispro. There were no known drug allergies. He was a senior in high school and worked part-time at a restaurant. He lived in an apartment in a suburban area of New England with his mother and three siblings. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had prediabetes, obesity, and hypertension; his mother and three siblings were healthy.

He was taken to the primary care clinic at another hospital and was told that he had a viral infection.\nNine days before this admission, new mild sore throat developed, and the patient returned to the primary care clinic. A throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was reportedly negative. The patient was told that he had possible sinusitis, and treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was started. During the next 3 days, the sore throat abated, but fatigue and fever persisted.\nSix days before this admission, new pain in the right shoulder and left knee developed, and the patient again returned to the primary care clinic. The white-cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reportedly elevated; a blood test for Lyme disease was performed.\nOn the day of admission, the joint pain progressed to involve the shoulders and knees on both sides, and the temperature increased to 39.4\u00b0C. The patient was given ibuprofen and brought to the emergency department at this hospital. On evaluation, the patient described aching pain in the shoulders and knees, which was worst in his right shoulder and left knee. He rated the pain at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had not noticed redness, swelling, or stiffness of the joints. A review of systems was notable for chills, intermittent night sweats, headache, myalgias, and lightheadedness when he stood up from a sitting position. He had no weight loss, rash, vision changes, or respiratory symptoms. He had mild abdominal cramping, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea. During the past week, there had been a few episodes of nonbloody emesis and watery diarrhea. There had been no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.\nThe patient had autism spectrum disorder, with an early delay in speech development that had resolved after speech therapy. He had met milestones for gross and fine motor skills and growth. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. Other history included asthma, seasonal rhinosinusitis, and allergies to peanuts and tree nuts; there were no known drug allergies. He had undergone a tonsillectomy in early childhood. Medications included amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, inhaled fluticasone, and ibuprofen and inhaled albuterol as needed.\nAt the time of admission, the patient was on his summer break before entering high school. Earlier in the summer, he had gone on vacation to a coastal area of New England. He had also attended camp in a rural area of New England, where he camped and hiked in wooded areas and swam in fresh water. He had seen a tick on his clothing but did not recall any bites. Two weeks before this admission, the patient had returned to his home in a suburban area of New England, where he lived with his mother (who was a veterinarian), father, sister, and pet dog. His sister had recently had an acute gastrointestinal illness that resolved after several days. The patient was not sexually active and did not use alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. His mother had hypothyroidism, and his maternal uncle had rheumatoid arthritis; there was no other known family history of autoimmune diseases.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.2. The patient appeared to be well developed and well nourished, but he looked tired. The conjunctivae were normal. The mucous membranes were dry, and there was an aphthous ulcer on the right buccal mucosa. The lungs were clear on auscultation. There was tenderness on palpation of the epigastric and periumbilical abdomen. There was no erythema, warmth, swelling, or crepitus of the large and small joints. There was tenderness on palpation, as well as pain with movement, of the right shoulder and knees; range of motion in these joints was not decreased. The patient had no rash or lymphadenopathy.\nThe white-cell count was 12,950 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 48 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13), the C-reactive protein level 207.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the lipase level 82 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60).

Ravicz (Pediatrics): A 20-year-old man with bipolar disorder was transferred to this hospital because of hemoptysis and hypoxemia.\nEleven months before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Six weeks before the current presentation, he was taken to another hospital for evaluation of racing thoughts, generalized hyperactivity, and difficulty sleeping. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. During the admission, the patient was involved in an altercation and was struck on the left side of the chest; pain subsequently developed in that area. Five weeks before the current presentation, chest pain persisted, and nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite developed. The patient was transported from the psychiatric hospital to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Teresa Victoria: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies.\nDr. Ravicz: The patient was told that he had a pulmonary contusion and was transported back to the psychiatric hospital. The dosages of quetiapine and paliperidone were increased. Four weeks before the current presentation, the patient had urticaria and intermittent nausea; a single dose of methylprednisolone was administered. Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged home.\nTen days before the current presentation, chest pain continued, cough developed, and nausea increased in severity. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a second hospital. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest (Figure 1B) revealed a consolidation in the left lower lobe and a left pleural effusion.\nDr. Ravicz: A course of doxycycline was started for the treatment of presumed pneumonia, and the patient was discharged home. During the subsequent 6 days, the cough and chest pain abated. Four days before the current presentation, the course of doxycycline was completed. During the next several days, the cough increased in severity and became productive of yellow sputum with dark-red streaks, and shortness of breath developed; nausea also increased in severity. One day before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated again in the emergency department of the second hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient appeared ill and had difficulty breathing. The temporal temperature was 37.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 99/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 31 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

There were small pleural effusions that were larger on the left side than on the right side.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies Obtained on Current Presentation.\nDr. Ravicz: Treatment with enoxaparin, vancomycin, and cefepime was started, and intravenous fluids were administered. The patient was admitted to the second hospital. On hospital day 2, the oxygen saturation decreased, and supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula. Blood cultures showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional evaluation and treatment.\nOn admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and nausea continued. The patient reported fatigue and weight loss that had started after the injury to the chest. He had also noticed discoloration in his fingers that was associated with changes in temperature. There was no headache, abdominal pain, or joint pain.\nThe patient had a history of asthma, migraines, and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. Bipolar disorder had been diagnosed when he was hospitalized for mania, grandiose thoughts, and paranoid delusions. Medications included quetiapine, paliperidone, and methylphenidate. Sulfa drugs and valproate had caused rash, nausea, and vomiting. The patient had previously been sexually active with female partners. He drank alcohol rarely and vaped marijuana frequently; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother, maternal aunt, paternal aunt, and paternal uncle had depression.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 89/40 mm Hg, the heart rate 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The right lung was clear on auscultation, but the left lung had diminished sounds. There was no abdominal tenderness, joint swelling, or rash. The patient had a flat affect, apathy, grandiose thoughts, poverty of speech and thought, and psychomotor retardation. There was no evidence of paranoia or hallucinations. The hemoglobin level was 8.7 g per deciliter and the albumin level 1.6 g per deciliter.

    "user_input": "Dr. Amy E. Armstrong-Javors: A 12-year-old boy with autism was admitted to this hospital because of decreased vision in both eyes.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 weeks before this admission, when he began to have difficulty seeing in both eyes. His vision was decreased when he woke up in the morning, improved throughout the day, and worsened again at night. Three weeks before the current admission, the patient told his parents about the vision changes. They took him to an optometry clinic for evaluation. Eyeglasses were not prescribed; a routine annual follow-up evaluation was scheduled.\nDuring the next 3 weeks, the patient noticed that the decrease in vision worsened. He typically walked on his toes and held onto his parents as he walked; however, 4 days before this admission, his parents noticed that he leaned on them heavily while walking. Two days before the current admission, they observed him walking into doors and walls and bumping into objects. On the day of this admission, the patient woke up screaming and panicked because he could not see. His parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported that his vision had improved slightly throughout the day. He described darkening of his vision that was worse in the left eye than in the right eye. He was having difficulty identifying movement and details of objects, although he was able to see shapes and colors. The parents reported that the patient had been having puffiness and crusting of the eyes for 2 days, with no eye redness or pain. Review of systems was notable for 3 days of diarrhea and nausea. He had no fever, headache, rashes, mouth sores, joint pain, or weakness.\nThe patient was born prematurely, at 7 months\u2019 gestation. Labor and delivery had taken place outside the hospital setting, and perinatal hypoxia had occurred. The patient had been taken urgently to another hospital, where he was resuscitated and then hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit for 2 months. The patient had autism and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He had developmental delays in speech, language, cognition, and fine motor skills. He had received all routine childhood vaccinations and was taking risperidone; there were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived with his parents and older sister, all of whom were healthy. Ten months before this admission, they had moved from an urban area to a rural area in New England. The patient was in sixth grade and was enrolled in special education classes at school. He had been an avid player of video and virtual reality games, but his parents had removed the gaming systems from their home 2 months before the patient\u2019s vision changes had begun. He continued to watch videos on the computer and television; his parents noted that he did not sit close to the devices and sometimes looked at the wall instead of the screen. The patient\u2019s parents described him as a \u201cpicky eater.\u201d His diet consisted almost exclusively of hamburgers, french fries, ranch dressing, glazed doughnuts, and juice boxes. The patient avoided trying new foods and did not take vitamin pills or gummies because he disliked the taste or texture.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 104/71 mm Hg, the heart rate 94 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 156 cm (70th percentile), the weight 40.3 kg (38th percentile), and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 16.6. The patient was pale, alert, interactive, and wary of the physical examination.\nDr. Ryan A. Gise: Mild periorbital swelling was present. The visual acuity in both eyes was limited to hand motion. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, and the extraocular movements were full. Color-vision testing, automated perimetry, fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography could not be performed because the patient had poor vision and was unable to cooperate. A slit-lamp examination was notable only for keratinization of the conjunctiva in both eyes. A funduscopic examination revealed pallor of the optic disk in both eyes. Examination of the peripheral retina was limited because the patient was unable to cooperate.\nDr. Armstrong-Javors: Strength, sensation, reflexes, and coordination were normal. A gait examination revealed toe walking; the patient asked for assistance when walking. The abdomen was nontender. Horizontal ridges were present on the toenails (Figure 1), and there were scattered bruises on the arms and legs. No ulcers or rashes were seen. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported pain in the left arm that occurred with supination or while she was making a fist. There was no numbness or tingling in the arm or hand or history of hemarthrosis, prolonged bleeding with dental procedures, or menorrhagia. The medical history was notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery stenosis, osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease, and obesity, as well as an episode of deep venous thrombosis 40 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol. The patient had smoked tobacco for 40 years but had quit 22 years earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She was widowed and lived alone but visited with her grown children regularly. Her father had had coronary artery disease.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 169/77 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

There was hyperdense stranding in the subcutaneous fat centered over the elbow and forearm, a finding consistent with hemorrhage (Figure 2). CT angiography of the arteries revealed heavy, partially calcified plaque throughout the thoracic aorta. Focal heavy plaque in the left subclavian artery proximal to the vertebral artery resulted in approximately 70 to 80% stenosis (Figure 3). The arteries in the left arm were otherwise patent. There were no signs of active hemorrhage on arterial or delayed-phase images or findings that could lead to localization of an arterial injury, such as pseudoaneurysm or dissection.

The patient had a 3-year history of mild problems with memory, but more severe memory issues had developed along with the change in affect. Four months before the current admission, she was admitted to another hospital after an acute episode of word-finding difficulty that had been witnessed by her daughter.\nDr. Saurabh Rohatgi: At that time, MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1A and 1B), revealed a subcentimeter focus of high signal intensity in the right frontal lobe on diffusion-weighted sequences and \u201cpseudonormalization\u201d on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient, with corresponding T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showing hyperintensity consistent with subacute infarction. T2-weighted FLAIR images also showed multiple foci of hyperintensity (measuring up to 1.1 cm in diameter) in both cerebellar hemispheres that were consistent with chronic infarcts. In addition, multiple areas of hyperintensity were seen on T2-weighted FLAIR images in the periventricular, deep, and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres; these findings were suggestive of small-vessel disease. Gradient-echo sequences showed several punctate foci of susceptibility in a lobar distribution, findings that were consistent with chronic microhemorrhages. Magnetic resonance angiography (Figure 1C) showed normal intracranial arteries.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI and Magnetic Resonance Angiography of the Head.\nDr. Rajarajan: Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function, dilatation of the atria and right ventricle, moderate mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and no evidence of intracardiac shunting. Treatment with aspirin was started, and the patient was discharged home on hospital day 3 with a plan for extended outpatient cardiac monitoring.\nTen days after discharge, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. The patient\u2019s daughter, who had been living with her since discharge from the hospital because she did not think that the patient was safe living alone, accompanied her to the appointment. The patient\u2019s daughter reported that the patient had been impulsive and occasionally confused, as well as progressively more forgetful. Attention and focus were impaired, and the patient had to be redirected during the interview. The remainder of the examination was normal. Treatment with mirtazapine was started for possible depression. Electroencephalography (EEG) was scheduled to rule out seizure with a postictal state as a cause of confusion. However, owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the EEG was canceled.\nDuring the next 14 weeks, the patient needed progressively more assistance with activities of daily living, including multiple reminders to eat meals and help with bathing. Her episodes of confusion occurred mostly at night. When these episodes began to increase in frequency, the patient\u2019s daughter brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nThe patient had difficulty recalling past and recent events, and additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s daughter. The patient had had an 11-kg weight loss during the preceding 3 months that the daughter had attributed to an improved diet while they were living together. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, emphysema, sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, and obesity. Stage II infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast had been diagnosed 17 years before the current admission and had been treated with lumpectomy and chemoradiation therapy, followed by 3 years of treatment with tamoxifen and exemestane. The patient continued to undergo surveillance with alternating mammography and MRI of the breasts every 6 months; the last breast MRI, which had been performed 5 months before the current admission, showed normal results. Stage 1 adenocarcinoma of the lung had been diagnosed 14 years before the current admission and had been treated with surgical resection. The patient continued to undergo surveillance with annual computed tomography (CT) of the chest; the last CT of the chest, which had been performed 13 months before the current admission, showed a stable nodule in the right upper lobe that measured 7 mm in diameter.\nMedications included esomeprazole, dulaglutide, hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, losartan, metformin, rosuvastatin, inhaled fluticasone, inhaled formoterol, and as-needed treatment with ipratropium\u2013albuterol delivered by nebulizer. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was retired and had previously worked as a nurse. She was divorced and had lived independently in New England until she was hospitalized 4 months before the current admission. She drank alcohol occasionally and had a 75-pack-year smoking history and quit after lung cancer was diagnosed. Her mother had had coronary artery disease, and her father had had emphysema.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 162/71 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 167.6 cm, the weight 91.3 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.4. The patient was alert and interactive; she was oriented to name only. She was inattentive and tangential in conversation, with perseveration. Her speech was fluent without paraphasic errors. Cranial-nerve function was normal. Test results for strength, sensation, deep-tendon reflexes, and cerebellar function were normal.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, thyrotropin, cobalamin, lactate dehydrogenase, cortisol, and C-reactive protein were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function and coagulation. The complete blood count and differential count were normal except for the level of hemoglobin, which was 10.2 g per liter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 35 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). Screening tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative, as was an interferon-\u03b3 release assay to detect previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Rohatgi: Chest radiography showed bibasilar patchy opacities. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new symmetric, confluent signal hyperintensity in the bilateral hippocampi, amygdala, and medial and anterior temporal lobes on T2-weighted and FLAIR images (Figure 1D and 1E). There was no evidence of acute or subacute infarction or associated abnormal enhancement. Multiple punctate foci of susceptibility were seen in a predominantly lobar distribution in both cerebral hemispheres on susceptibility-weighted imaging (Figure 1F) \u2014 a finding that was suggestive of microhemorrhages. New hemosiderin staining was present within the sulci of the right parietal lobe.\nDr. Rajarajan: A lumbar puncture was performed for evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which was clear and colorless. In the third tube of CSF, there were 3 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5) and 8 red cells per microliter (reference value, 0). The CSF level of protein was 47 mg per deciliter (reference range, 8 to 32) and the glucose level 112 mg per deciliter (6.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 40 to 70 mg per deciliter [2.2 to 3.9 mmol per liter]). The concurrent blood level of glucose was 191 mg per deciliter (10.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 74 to 100 mg per deciliter [4.1 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). There were 16 oligoclonal bands (reference range, 0 to 1); an IgG index was not obtained. No organisms were seen on Gram\u2019s staining, and nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA was negative. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\nAn EEG showed diffuse delta and theta slowing and disorganization of the background. There were abundant bilateral independent, temporal epileptiform discharges as well as brief runs of independent, lateralized periodic discharges in both temporal lobes.\nDiagnostic tests were performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Carrie Chui (Neurology): A 79-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of involuntary movements on the left side and transient unresponsiveness.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before admission, when involuntary movements of the left shoulder and left side of the face developed. The movements were described by the patient as twitching, were not associated with a change in the level of consciousness, and resolved after 1 to 2 minutes. During the next 6 months, the patient had similar episodes approximately once per month, but the episodes increased in duration, lasting 5 to 6 minutes.\nThree months before admission, the episodes of involuntary movements increased in frequency, and the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The physical examination was normal. Results of kidney-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose and electrolytes, except for the sodium level, which was 129 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). There was a history of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and the sodium level was similar to levels obtained during the past 4 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a focus of enhancement in the right middle frontal gyrus that was thought to be a small vascular anomaly. Electroencephalography (EEG), performed with the patient in awake and drowsy states, revealed rare, brief, focal slowing in the left temporal lobe during drowsiness; no epileptiform abnormalities were present.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head and CT Angiogram of the Head and Neck.\nTwo months before admission, the patient was evaluated in the epilepsy clinic affiliated with this hospital. He reported that the episodes of involuntary movements had increased in both frequency and duration, occurring once or twice per day and lasting approximately 10 minutes. Episodes began with tingling and numbness in the left leg that prompted the patient to voluntarily stomp the left foot to relieve the uncomfortable sensation. Then, the patient had involuntary movements that he described as an uncontrollable invisible force moving the left leg and arm, with hyperextension of the arm backward and pronation of the wrist. There was associated numbness in the distal portions of the left third, fourth, and fifth fingers and involuntary movement of the left cheek. No prodromal symptoms occurred. The patient had awareness during the episodes, and after the episodes, he felt fatigued but had a normal level of consciousness, without confusion. The examination in the epilepsy clinic was normal. A diagnosis of seizure disorder was considered, and treatment with levetiracetam was started.\nThree weeks before admission, the patient was again evaluated in the epilepsy clinic. He reported that the episodes of involuntary movements still occurred on a daily basis but had decreased in duration and involved only the left leg, without abnormal movements of the arm or face. Dizziness, headache, and weakness had developed and were attributed to the use of levetiracetam. The patient\u2019s family had recorded a video of one of the episodes of involuntary movements. After reviewing the video, the patient\u2019s neurologist thought that the episodes were less likely to be caused by seizures and more consistent with choreoathetoid movements. Cross-tapering of medications \u2014 with the simultaneous administration of levetiracetam in decreasing doses and clobazam in increasing doses \u2014 was initiated, and the patient was referred to the movement disorders clinic affiliated with this hospital.\nOn the morning of admission, an episode of involuntary movements of the left leg and left shoulder occurred and persisted for 1 hour. Several hours after the symptoms abated, the patient\u2019s wife found the patient to be unresponsive; he was sitting in a chair. Emergency medical services were called, and when they arrived, the patient was responsive. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 180 mg per deciliter (10.0 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported dysuria and increased urinary frequency. The patient\u2019s daughter noted that he had been more anxious during the past 3 years and occasionally had trouble with memory. Other medical history included Barrett\u2019s esophagus, benign prostatic hypertrophy, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, eczema, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and osteoporosis. There was no history of head trauma or extended loss of consciousness. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, doxazosin, finasteride, omeprazole, metoprolol, sacubitril, and valsartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol rarely; he did not use illicit drugs. His mother had had gastric cancer, and his sister had had esophageal cancer; there was no family history of seizures.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 152/97 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.7. The blood pressure decreased to 130/63 mm Hg with standing. The patient was alert and interactive. The lower jaw was held to the left, but the nasolabial folds and smile were symmetric with activation. There were nonrhythmic, nonstereotyped, writhing movements of the left arm. Tone was normal, and strength was assessed as 5 out of 5 in the arms and legs. Results of liver-function and kidney-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose and electrolytes, except for the sodium level, which was 125 mmol per liter. The lactate level was 2.1 mmol per liter (19 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]). The urinalysis was normal. Intravenous fluids were administered. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Rajiv Gupta: Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1B) revealed extensively calcified plaque with severe stenosis of the distal right common carotid artery (CCA), extending into the proximal right internal carotid artery (ICA), as well as stenosis of the right and left paraclinoid ICAs and the left vertebral artery at its origin. There was no vascular abnormality on the CT angiogram that corresponded to the abnormality in the right middle frontal gyrus seen on the previous MRI.\nDr. Chui: The patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the sodium level had increased to 130 mmol per liter, and the lactate level was normal. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Gupta: MRI of the head showed no evidence of acute infarction. The focus of enhancement in the right frontal lobe that had been noted previously was not seen on the current MRI.\nDr. Chui: Blood levels of thyrotropin, cobalamin, and glycated hemoglobin and results of coagulation tests were normal. Screening tests for Lyme disease, tuberculosis, and syphilis were negative, as were tests for antibodies to cardiolipin and \u03b22-glycoprotein. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive, at a titer of 1:160 in a homogeneous pattern. During a physical therapy session, the patient had abnormal movements of the left leg, left arm, and left side of the face. The abnormal movements diminished when the patient used distraction techniques, such as thigh tapping, finger snapping, and walking while holding a glass of water.\nThe transient unresponsiveness that led to the patient\u2019s admission was attributed to a combination of sedation from clobazam and hypovolemia. Treatment with clobazam was stopped, and hydration was encouraged. A diagnosis of functional neurologic disorder was considered; outpatient physical therapy with continued use of distraction techniques was recommended. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day.\nEpisodes of involuntary movements continued to occur on a daily basis at home. Two weeks after discharge, when the patient was doing exercises while sitting in a chair and having a conversation with his wife, he suddenly stopped talking. She found him slumped in the chair with his eyes closed, no longer exercising. When she asked him questions, he repeatedly said \u201cyes.\u201d Emergency medical services were called, and when they arrived, the patient was alert, diaphoretic, and nonverbal. He had a facial droop on the left side and a right gaze preference. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 130 mg per deciliter (7.2 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 143/63 mm Hg, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and interactive. There was a facial droop on the left side. There was no effort against gravity in the left arm. The patient was able to lift the left leg off the bed for 1 to 2 seconds. He had a right gaze deviation that could not be overcome and mild dysarthria. The remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of stroke was considered, and emergency CT angiography was performed.\nDr. Gupta: CT angiography showed no evidence of acute territorial infarction and no changes in cerebrovascular disease.\nDr. Chui: On repeat physical examination performed after CT angiography, the gaze deviation and dysarthria had resolved, and strength was normal. Mild facial paralysis was present.\nA diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Patrick Malecha (Medicine): A 69-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and an implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) was evaluated because of dyspnea during an urgent visit at an outpatient primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 days before the current presentation, when he felt unwell while working. He had dyspnea on exertion (while moving and stocking boxes and when walking home from work), with baseline exertional dyspnea that occurred after ascending two to three flights of stairs. The next day, the patient had palpitations and felt lightheaded throughout the day. The palpitations continued, and he was evaluated by his primary care physician at an outpatient primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital.\nOn a review of systems, the patient reported nausea with intermittent retching, anorexia (eating only a slice of cheese for the day), and fatigue. He stated that his right eye was \u201cout of focus,\u201d but he also noted that he had had this symptom in the past. He reported no chest pain or pressure. Although he had often had angina in the past, the patient noted that he had not had any episodes in the past 2 years and that he had had only one episode of substernal discomfort, which occurred while he was walking and had lasted 45 seconds. In addition, he had had no presyncope or loss of consciousness, ICD discharge, edema, orthopnea, paroxysms of nocturnal dyspnea, fever, known sick contacts, diarrhea, weight change, abdominal pain or bloating, dysuria, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, bleeding symptoms, or focal neurologic symptoms. He had not missed any doses of medications, and his last ICD check was 3 months before the current presentation.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for premature coronary artery disease, with a first occurrence of myocardial infarction in his third decade of life. In his fifth decade of life, he had undergone coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) and subsequent stenting of the native left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary angiography, which was performed 2 years earlier for evaluation of angina, showed that the bypass graft and stent were patent but that severe native coronary disease was present (and was unchanged from an earlier study). The patient\u2019s medical history also included ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronically reduced ejection fraction and scarring of the inferior and inferoposterior left ventricle, and ventricular tachycardia that had been treated with antiarrhythmic medication and an ICD. The ICD had been placed 3 years before the current presentation during an admission at this hospital for syncope that was followed by in-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia, which required multiple external defibrillations. Thereafter, the patient received treatment with oral amiodarone; however, device interrogation revealed intermittent ventricular tachycardia at rates of 109 to 117 beats per minute that persisted over the next 8 months, and he underwent endocardial ablation of ventricular tachycardia in the scar of the mid-inferior wall. Six months after ablation, he was readmitted to this hospital because of nausea and dizziness that were due to recurrent sustained slow ventricular tachycardia (110 beats per minute), for which he was treated with intravenous lidocaine and antitachycardia pacing.\nIn addition, the patient\u2019s medical history included bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement concurrent with CABG, which had been complicated by prosthetic valve deterioration with mixed stenosis and mitral regurgitation, and culminated in transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement 2.5 years before the current presentation. He also had a history of hypertension, pulmonary embolism (4 years before the current presentation), iron-deficiency anemia, a colonic polyp, and prolonged encephalopathy after CABG. Medications included aspirin, coumadin, furosemide, metoprolol, lisinopril, dapagliflozin, ranolazine, atorvastatin, ferrous gluconate, paroxetine, and clonazepam. Treatment with amiodarone had previously been associated with elevations in liver-function test results. At the patient\u2019s last office visit with an electrophysiologist 6 months before the current presentation, device interrogation showed no ventricular tachycardia and the heart rate was 60 beats per minute; treatment with amiodarone was discontinued.\nDr. Emily K. Zern: A transthoracic echocardiogram obtained at the same office visit with the electrophysiologist showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 31% with inferior, posterior, and apical territory dysfunction; right ventricular hypokinesis; a left-to-right interatrial shunt; trace-to-mild aortic insufficiency; a well-seated mitral valve prosthesis with no regurgitation and a mean transmitral gradient of 5 mm Hg; and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 31 mm Hg.\nDr. Malecha: At a primary care visit 5 months before the current presentation, the patient reported bloating. The heart rate was 62 beats per minute and the blood pressure 104/64 mm Hg. The thyrotropin level was normal, the N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level 646 pg per milliliter (reference value, <900), the hematocrit level 40.9% (reference range, 41.0 to 53.0), and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level 74 mg per deciliter (1.92 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 129 mg per deciliter [1.29 to 3.34 mmol per liter]).\nThe patient had had a routine office visit with his cardiologist 18 days before the current presentation, during which the heart rate was 63 beats per minute and the blood pressure 111/69 mm Hg; the weight was 83 kg. No changes were made to his medications.\nDr. Conor D. Barrett: An electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained at the visit with the cardiologist showed atrial pacing, first-degree atrioventricular delay, right bundle-branch block, and evidence of old inferior, apical, and posterior myocardial infarctions (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Electrocardiogram.\nDr. Malecha: The patient was employed in multiple service jobs. He did not drink alcohol or use tobacco or other substances. He lived with several roommates on the fourth floor of an apartment building in an urban area and climbed stairs daily. His family history was notable for coronary artery disease in his father and stroke in his father, mother, and maternal grandmother.\nAt the current presentation, the temporal temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute and regular, the blood pressure 84/59 mm Hg while the patient was sitting and 99/67 mm Hg while he was in the supine position, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83 kg. The patient appeared diaphoretic and clammy, and the skin was warm to the touch. He was alert, oriented, and lucid. The previous sternotomy and ICD sites were intact. There was no heart murmur; however, a possible S3 heart sound and minimal basilar rales were observed. The jugular venous pulse was difficult to visualize. A healed appendectomy scar was present, but the abdomen was nontender, the liver was nonpulsatile, and there was no fluid wave. The legs were warm with mild, symmetric pedal edema.\nLaboratory test results were obtained 2 weeks before the current presentation. The sodium level was 139 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145), the potassium level 4.1 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.0), the creatinine level 0.91 mg per deciliter (80.44 \u03bcg per liter; reference range, 0.80 to 1.30 mg per deciliter [70.72 to 114.92 \u03bcg per liter]), the hematocrit 44.0%, the NT-proBNP 669 pg per milliliter, and the international normalized ratio (INR) 2.9 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1).\nDiagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Kathleen W. Miller (Medicine): A 64-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in early winter with fever and pancytopenia.\nThe patient, who had multiple sclerosis, had been in her usual state of health until 7 months before admission, when nausea and fatigue developed. Over the next 2 months, these symptoms worsened, and in the context of severe nausea, two episodes of vasovagal syncope occurred. During an evaluation for syncope, anemia was noted.

Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed cholelithiasis and splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 17 cm in the craniocaudal dimension (normal value, \u226412 cm).\nTwo and a half months before admission, the patient was evaluated in a hematology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She reported persistent nausea and fatigue, poor appetite with reduced oral intake, and 2 weeks of dyspnea on exertion. There was no orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The weight was 83.2 kg, and the spleen tip was palpable four fingerbreadths below the costal margin; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, and examination of the bone marrow specimen revealed mildly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and mild dyserythropoiesis.\nTreatment with prednisone and folic acid was begun. Ocrelizumab infusions for multiple sclerosis were stopped. Nausea and fatigue persisted, and fevers and sweats developed. After 3 weeks of treatment with prednisone, the anemia had not abated and the patient had temperatures as high as 39.0\u00b0C. Testing for influenza A and B viruses was negative. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The course of prednisone was tapered off over the next 18 days, and the patient was referred to a hematologist affiliated with this hospital.\nIn the hematology clinic, the patient reported that the fevers had resolved but the fatigue, weakness, and poor appetite had worsened. She felt too fatigued to walk, and she had recently had a fall without loss of consciousness. The weight was 82.4 kg; splenomegaly was present, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nIn addition to relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis, there was a history of trigeminal neuralgia, restless legs syndrome, vasovagal syncope when blood samples were obtained, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level for 1 year without a clear cause. Medications included oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, ropinirole, folic acid, and cholecalciferol. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had quit smoking 20 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her adult son and pet cat and dog. Her backyard adjoined a large wooded area where deer were often seen. She worked in health care administration. Her family history included diabetes in her mother, lung cancer in her father, and multiple sclerosis in her sister.\nOn examination, the patient appeared pale but not unwell. The temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 90/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 93 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.2. The conjunctivae were pale. The heart rate was regular, with normal first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) and a soft systolic murmur. There was edema in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis and coagulation tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was administered. Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered daily for 3 days, and the patient reported a decrease in weakness and fatigue.\nDr. Dexter P. Mendoza: On hospital day 4, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1A) revealed splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 19 cm in the craniocaudal dimension. Concurrent positron-emission tomography with injection of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (Figure 1B) revealed intense uptake in the spleen and diffuse uptake in the bone marrow throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Miller: On hospital day 5, the patient reported a recurrence of severe fatigue and generalized weakness. The temperature was 39.0\u00b0C and the heart rate 130 beats per minute. The results of physical examination were otherwise unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nA diagnostic test result was received.",

Castle: A 56-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in the spring of 2020, during the initial surge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic in Boston, because of fever, myalgias, diarrhea, and a dry cough.\nSix weeks before this admission, the patient had contact with a person with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. At that time, she did not have any symptoms compatible with Covid-19 and was not tested for SARS-CoV-2.\nFour weeks before this admission, in accordance with statewide recommendations from the Department of Public Health, the patient began isolating at home with her teenage son, working from home, and having groceries delivered. Two weeks before this admission, she and her son left home for a few hours to eat outdoors and spend time in a wooded area; they otherwise remained at home.\nSix days before this admission, fever, chills, and myalgias developed. The next day, watery diarrhea occurred. The patient\u2019s temperature measured at home was 38.3\u00b0C; fever persisted despite the intermittent administration of acetaminophen. Three days before this admission, a frontal headache developed, along with a dry cough that was associated with a self-limited episode of chest pain. The patient\u2019s son had had no symptoms, except for a self-limited episode of diarrhea 2 weeks before the patient\u2019s symptoms developed. On the day of admission, the patient continued to have fever, so she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing myalgias, headache, and cough. There was no nausea, vomiting, rash, shortness of breath, or anosmia. She had no notable medical history and took no medications. She was allergic to amoxicillin, with an unknown reaction. She did not smoke tobacco and drank alcohol rarely; she did not use illicit drugs. The patient lived in an urban area of New England and had traveled to Canada 6 months before this admission. She had a pet cat; there was no other animal contact.\nOn examination, the patient appeared anxious, but breathing was unlabored. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 121/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% at rest and 98% during ambulation, both while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented to time, place, and person. There were no focal neurologic deficits. There was no meningism. The mucous membranes were dry. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without additional sounds or murmurs. There were vesicular breath sounds. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly.

Andrews (Medicine): A 39-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital during the summer because of fever with shaking chills, diffuse headache, and fatigue, which had lasted for the 4 days since he had returned from a trip to East Africa.\nDuring the patient\u2019s 2-week trip, he had been on a safari in Tanzania but had not had any contact with animals. He reported that he had received mosquito bites, especially during the first days of the trip. He had eaten cooked shrimp and lobster and a small amount of raw tuna. On the second-to-last day of the trip, nausea, vomiting, and nonbloody diarrhea developed. On the last day of the trip, the patient had fatigue and slept for much of the day; however, he felt well enough to travel home the next day.\nOn the night the patient returned home to Massachusetts, he began to have fever with a temperature of 38.3\u00b0C, along with shaking chills, diffuse headache, and lower back pain. The following day, he presented to an urgent care facility because of fever, malaise, and headache. The oral temperature was 38.5\u00b0C; the remainder of the examination was normal. Nucleic acid testing was negative for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Oral prednisone was prescribed for the treatment of headache. On the third day home, in the evening, the patient had fever with a temperature of 39.5\u00b0C and lower back pain. The next morning, 4 days after returning from the trip, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported recurrent fevers accompanied by blurry vision, which had occurred despite the use of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and prednisone. He reported ongoing weakness and anorexia, noting that he was consuming mostly fruits and electrolyte-replacement solutions. He had had nausea with diarrhea but without vomiting. The patient noted that his urine output had decreased and that the urine appeared darker than usual. Review of systems was negative for myalgias, rash, neck stiffness, photophobia, respiratory symptoms, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, and joint pain. His travel companion reported no symptoms. The patient reported no known tick exposures before or during travel in Tanzania.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for degenerative knee disease with a meniscus tear, for which he had received glucocorticoid injections. There were no known adverse drug reactions. He had received a series of three vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2. He lived with his partner in a suburb of Boston. He had been a competitive athlete and was employed in the energy industry. He drank beer occasionally and did not use tobacco or other substances.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113/62 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 104.3 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 30.3. Facial flushing and mild scleral icterus were present. The urine was dark brown. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of calcium, creatine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An extended respiratory viral panel and a screening test for Lyme disease IgM and IgG antibodies were negative. Urinalysis showed 3+ blood, and microscopic examination of the urinary sediment showed 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2).

    "user_input": "Dr. Ya Haddy Sallah (Medicine): A 29-year-old man with sickle cell disease was admitted to this hospital because of pain in the right hip.\nThe patient had received a diagnosis of sickle cell disease in childhood. The sickle cell disease had been complicated by vaso-occlusive events with pain severe enough to lead to hospitalization 3 or 4 times per year. He also had a history of osteonecrosis of the hips that had led to treatment with total hip arthroplasty of both hips 3 years before the current presentation.\nSeven days before the current presentation, the patient presented to this hospital with pain in the low back, hips, and legs, which had developed 1 day after he had carried boxes up several flights of stairs. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. He was admitted to the hospital, and imaging studies were obtained.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (This Hospital), 7 Days before Current Admission, On Current Admission\n\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 25.1, 21.0\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 8.8, 7.5\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 15,310, 15,680\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 9800, 12,680\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 4160, 2350\nMonocytes, 200\u20131200, 1350, 690\nEosinophils, 0\u2013900, 0, 140\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 456,000, 581,000\nMean corpuscular volume (fl), 80.0\u2013100.0, 80.7, 79.5\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin (pg), 26.0\u201334.0, 28.3, 28.4\nRed-cell distribution width (%), 11.5\u201314.5, 24.2, 24.7\nReticulocyte count (%), 0.7\u20132.5, 7.4, \u2014\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 1.8, \u2014\nDirect bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20130.4, 0.4, \u2014\nD-dimer (ng/ml), <500, \u2014, 3900\n\nDr. F. Joseph Simeone: Posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the chest (Figure 1A) showed normal lungs and a normal cardiac silhouette; superior and inferior end-plate depressions in midthoracic vertebral bodies were noted. Frontal and lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine (Figure 1B) showed superior and inferior end-plate depressions at multiple vertebral levels and diffuse bony sclerosis, findings consistent with bony changes from sickle cell disease. An anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis (Figure 1C) showed evidence of total hip arthroplasty; the findings had not changed from those observed on recently obtained radiographs.\nFIGURE 1\n\nRadiographs of the Chest, Spine, and Pelvis Obtained 7 Days before the Current Admission.\nDr. Sallah: A diagnosis of a painful vaso-occlusive event was made, and treatment included intravenous fluids, ketorolac, and hydromorphone. Musculoskeletal strain was considered to be a contributing factor for the pain, given the recent strenuous activity. The pain slowly abated, and on hospital day 5, the patient was discharged home.\nOne day after discharge, and 2 days before the current presentation, pain in the right hip developed while the patient was at rest. Despite treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen, the hip pain worsened, and the patient was unable to walk. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported pain in the right hip that felt different in quality from the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. He also reported pleuritic chest pain that felt similar in quality to the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. The tympanic temperature measured at home was 37.8\u00b0C.\nDuring the 6 months before the current presentation, vaso-occlusive events had increased in frequency and severity. There had been three hospital admissions with a duration of 4 to 8 days, including one admission for acute chest syndrome. The pain associated with vaso-occlusive events typically involved the chest, arms, or thighs. There was a history of automated red-cell exchange, which had been performed before total hip arthroplasty; there was also a history of four blood transfusions. Other history included tinnitus, symmetric high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, and cholelithiasis. Medications included voxelotor and folic acid, as well as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and hydromorphone as needed for pain. The patient had no known allergies. He lived in a suburb of Boston and worked as an engineer. He had traveled to West Africa 1 year before the current presentation and to South Asia 3 weeks before the current presentation. He drank alcohol occasionally, had never smoked tobacco, and did not use illicit drugs. Both of his parents and his brother had sickle cell trait.\nThe temporal temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 121/56 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. He had mild tenderness on palpation of the right hip but no obvious deformity; there was a well-healed incision without overlying erythema. He was able to fully extend and flex the right hip, but such movement caused mild discomfort. There was moderate discomfort with the log-roll test (rolling the thigh internally and externally with the patient in the supine position). The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 15,680 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the hemoglobin level 7.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the platelet count 581,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The blood C-reactive protein level was 100.6 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 113 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 14). Nucleic acid amplification testing for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Simeone: Findings on radiographs of the chest, hips, and pelvis were unchanged from those observed 7 days earlier.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

Materne (Pediatrics): A 12-month-old boy with Hirschsprung\u2019s disease was admitted to this hospital because of fever.\nFifteen days before the current admission, the patient had a temperature of 39.7\u00b0C. His parents noticed that he was fussy and less active than usual and that he had a decreased appetite along with several episodes of \u201cspitting up\u201d; there was no vomiting or diarrhea. During the next 5 days, fever occurred daily and abated with the administration of acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Ten days before the current admission, a bowel movement with watery, nonbloody, foul-smelling, mustard-yellow stool occurred. The patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the patient was irritable. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There were well-circumscribed, erythematous, edematous plaques on the abdomen, legs, feet, and forearms. The alanine aminotransferase level was 131 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the aspartate aminotransferase level 250 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 80), the ferritin level 3826 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 30 to 300), and the d-dimer level 3218 ng per milliliter (reference range, <500). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 40 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 15); the white-cell count was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A radiograph of the abdomen showed gas-filled loops of bowel. The rectum was irrigated, and intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered. On the third hospital day, the patient was afebrile and able to take formula, and the diarrhea abated. He was discharged home with a prescription for a course of metronidazole.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range, On Arrival (First Admission), On Arrival (Current Admission)\n\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 6000\u201317,500, 8180, 26,820\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 1500\u20138600, 3590, 20,060\nLymphocytes, 360\u201311,700, 3980, 4910\nMonocytes, 100\u20131900, 530, 460\nEosinophils, 0\u20131400, 20, 1150\nBasophils, 0\u2013500, 30, 0\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 388,000, 682,000\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 10.5\u201313.5, 10.4, 10.3\nHematocrit (%), 33.0\u201339.0, 34.4, 33.8\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 13.1, 13.8\nProthrombin-time international normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.0, 1.1\nD-dimer (ng/ml), <500, 3218, 2389\nFibrinogen (mg/dl), 150\u2013400, 290, 469\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), 30\u2013300, 3826, 689\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201315, 40, 75\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), <8.0, 32.4, 114.7\nProcalcitonin (ng/ml), 0.00\u20130.08, \u2014, 0.59\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.30\u20131.00, 0.22, 0.21\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 131, 40\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201380, 250, 50\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 142\u2013335, 163, 176\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/liter), 13\u201360, 498, 490\n\nDuring the next 2 days, the patient had no fever or diarrhea. However, 4 days before the current admission, a day-care worker observed that the patient appeared tired. During the subsequent 3 days at home, fever again developed, with chills and a decreased appetite. The day before the current admission, the patient cried through the night. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nThe parents reported that the patient was fussy and had poor sleep and generalized weakness; there was no diarrhea or new rash. The parents did not think that the patient was in pain. Additional history was obtained from the parents. The patient had met developmental milestones until 1 month earlier, when he had stopped crawling. He had previously been able to pull his body into a standing position, but he no longer attempted this maneuver. If he was placed in a standing position, he collapsed; if he was placed in a sitting position, he was able to stay upright. He had previously passed objects from hand to hand, but he had a new preference of holding objects with the left hand. Two days before this evaluation, the parents had noticed that the patient no longer walked with support; he seemed to dislike having his hands held.\nThe patient had cornea plana and a history of Hirschsprung\u2019s disease, for which he had undergone laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and an anal pull-through procedure at 2 months of age. Four months before the current evaluation, an intermittent diffuse rash on the trunk, arms, and legs had developed. The rash was characterized by purplish and pinkish plaques that appeared and varied in intensity of color throughout the day; it did not seem to be itchy or painful and usually resolved within 24 hours without treatment.\nImmunizations were up to date. Medications included metronidazole, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and cetirizine, as well as carboxymethylcellulose eye drops; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient lived with his mother, father, and pet dog in a small town in New England, and he attended day care 5 days per week. His mother was healthy, and his father had irritable bowel syndrome and Poland syndrome (congenital aplasia of unilateral chest-wall muscles). His paternal grandmother had hypothyroidism, his maternal great-grandfather had had pancreatic cancer, his paternal great-grandfather had had breast cancer, a maternal second cousin had autism, and multiple maternal family members had Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 113/52 mm Hg, the heart rate 166 beats per minute (normal range for age, 80 to 160), and the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute (normal range for age, 30 to 60). The patient was diaphoretic and irritable, and he cried during the examination. He had rhinorrhea. The abdomen was not distended or tender. There was limited extension of the wrists and knees, as well as limited inversion and eversion of the feet. The ankles were mildly stiff, and the feet were mildly swollen. There were erythematous plaques on the abdomen, back, arms, and legs (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs.\nThe ferritin and d-dimer levels remained elevated, and the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 75 mm per hour, the white-cell count 26,820 per microliter (reference range, 6000 to 17,500), and the platelet count 682,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood cultures and urinalysis were normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Randheer Shailam: A radiograph of the chest and abdomen was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed cholelithiasis and prominent lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed a small amount of joint fluid in the hips and knees (Figure 2); the amount of fluid appeared to be within the normal range. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder, without gallbladder distention. There were a few prominent lymph nodes in the paraaortic, iliac, and inguinal regions (Figure 2). Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal coronary arteries.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Materne: The empirical administration of intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was begun. During the next 3 days, the fever continued and the white-cell count remained elevated. On the seventh hospital day, the fever, leukocytosis, and elevation in levels of inflammatory markers persisted. The administration of antibiotic agents was stopped.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Meridale V. Baggett: One hundred years ago, a 24-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.1\nThe patient had been well until 3 days before this admission, when malaise, generalized weakness, headache, and back pain developed. During the next 2 days, his symptoms persisted, and he remained at home and slept in bed for most of the day. On the day before this admission, he began to have fever, dry cough, and chills that caused him to shake considerably and \u201chunched him up in a knot.\u201d He was unable to get out of bed. He took aspirin at a dose of 10 grains (648 mg) every 4 hours, which led to decreased severity of the headache and back pain. On the day of this admission, the patient awoke with difficulty breathing and chest pain just below the xiphoid process. The pain increased with deep breathing and coughing. He sought evaluation at this hospital.\nOn examination, the rectal temperature ranged from 39.5\u00b0C to 40.8\u00b0C, the heart rate from 92 to 145 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate from 28 to 58 breaths per minute. The patient appeared acutely ill and nervous. He was shivering despite being wrapped up in several blankets. His breathing was rapid, shallow, and labored. He had frequent paroxysms of racking cough, which caused excruciating pain under the lower sternum. The cough was productive of pinkish, thick, slightly purulent sputum.\nOn palpation, the apical impulse of the heart was felt in the fifth intercostal space, 8 cm to the left of the sternum along the midclavicular line. There was no enlargement of the heart on percussion. On auscultation, the heart sounds were rapid and regular, and there was a soft systolic murmur at the apex that did not radiate. The breath sounds were diminished at the right side of the back, from the lower third of the scapula downward, but had no definitive dullness or change in character. No evidence of rales or a friction rub was noted.\nThe throat was somewhat injected, and the tonsils had been surgically removed. A healed surgical scar was present on the left side of the abdomen, at the site of a previous hernia repair. The abdomen was not distended or tender. The skin was dry and hot to the touch. The white-cell count ranged from 3700 to 14,500 per microliter, with neutrophil predominance (79%). Blood cultures showed no growth.\nDr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: A posteroanterior chest radiograph (Figure 1) showed bilateral patchy consolidations, previously described as \u201cmottled dullness,\u201d that were most confluent in the right upper lobe and the left lower lobe. This finding is suggestive of pneumonia. There was also fullness in the left hilar region, which is suggestive of lymphadenopathy. The presence of a left pleural effusion cannot be ruled out.\nFIGURE 1\n\nChest Radiograph.\nDr. Kathy M. Tran: Adhesive plaster was applied to the patient\u2019s chest, and he was admitted to this hospital. On the second hospital day, the shortness of breath and chest pain on inspiration continued. The cough became productive of purulent sputum and blood. W.H. Smith performed a physical examination. The patient appeared very ill and held his abdominal muscles rigid while coughing. A systolic apical bruit was detected, along with dullness at the right lung base. Small hyperemic papules were seen on the left palm and the right index finger. Smith noted a \u201cserious outlook\u201d for the patient.\nOn the third hospital day, the sputum became much more purulent. On examination, increased dullness was noted on percussion of the left lower back. Increased tactile fremitus was also noted. Loud bronchial breath sounds and very few rales were heard at the left side of the back, from the lower third of the scapula downward. Slight dullness was present on percussion of the right lower back, and there were distant breath sounds and occasional medium rales.\nOn the fourth hospital day, the patient continued to be very ill. He gradually grew weaker, and that evening, he died.\nA diagnosis was made.",

Madhavan: A 30-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital for the third time in 4 weeks because of recurrent fever.\nThe patient had been well until 4 weeks before the current presentation, when fever, dry cough, nasal congestion, and decreased intake of solid foods developed. The next day, while he was playing in a park with his siblings, he began limping. No trauma had preceded the onset of limping. The patient\u2019s parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nThe patient was afebrile. He was interactive but appeared tired and walked with a limp, favoring the left leg. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The white-cell count was 28,440 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 63 mm per hour (reference range, 9 to 14), and the C-reactive protein level 31.3 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0). Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for culture, and imaging studies were obtained.\nTable 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nDr. Evan J. Zucker: Ultrasonography of the hip and radiography of the pelvis showed no abnormalities. Radiography of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed peribronchial cuffing and patchy perihilar opacities.\nFigure 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Chest and Abdomen.\nDr. Madhavan: The patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, he remained afebrile, had a normal energy level, and was walking normally. Blood cultures showed no growth. He was discharged home.\nTwo days after discharge, fever recurred. The patient\u2019s mother brought him back to emergency department of this hospital. The patient was afebrile, but leukocytosis and elevated levels of inflammatory markers persisted. Tests of a nasopharyngeal swab were positive for coronavirus (not severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and for human rhinovirus and enterovirus. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was again obtained for culture, and additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Zucker: Ultrasonography of the abdomen (Figure 1B) revealed multiple hypoechoic splenic lesions, measuring up to 6 mm in diameter. No cholelithiasis, thickening of the gallbladder wall, or biliary ductal dilatation was present. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1C), abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, was notable for mediastinal lymphadenopathy mostly involving the paratracheal and subcarinal lymph node stations, as well as right hilar lymphadenopathy.\nDr. Madhavan: The patient was readmitted to the hospital. During the next 3 days, he had intermittent fever, which abated after the administration of ibuprofen. Blood cultures showed no growth. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was discharged home with recommendations for continued supportive care and instructions to undergo additional laboratory testing and imaging studies.\nDuring the subsequent 3 weeks, the patient continued to have intermittent fever. On the day of the current presentation, planned outpatient laboratory testing was performed. The white-cell count was 42,390 per microliter, and the patient\u2019s mother was asked to bring him back to the emergency department for evaluation.\nThe patient\u2019s mother reported that the patient had fever once or twice daily. The episodes of fever were associated with chills, and the patient seemed averse to being held or touched. When he had no fever, he was playful and behaved normally. He had persistent dry cough, nasal congestion, and decreased intake of solid foods. There was no vomiting, diarrhea, or blood or mucus in the stool.\nThe patient had had normal growth and had met normal developmental milestones. He had iron-deficiency anemia. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies. Immunizations were up to date. His parents had immigrated to the United States from Central America. The patient and his siblings had been born in the United States, lived in a suburban area of New England, and had not traveled outside the region. His parents and older sister were healthy. One older brother had developmental delay and sensorineural hearing loss of unknown cause. Three and a half years before the patient\u2019s current presentation, another older brother had received a diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection at 31 months of age.\nOn examination, the axillary temperature was 40.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/61 mm Hg, the pulse 180 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 55 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was crying but consolable. Breathing was normal, without grunting or intercostal retractions, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There was palpable right axillary lymphadenopathy; he resisted examination of the left axilla. No cervical or inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted. No focal tenderness on palpation of the arms, legs, or joints was present, and there was no rash.\nDr. Zucker: Radiography of the chest revealed an opacity in the right lower lobe. Subsequent CT of the chest, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 1D), revealed multifocal pulmonary opacities with a basilar predominance in both lungs, along with lymphadenopathy that was relatively unchanged from that observed on previous CT imaging.\nDr. Madhavan: Administration of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula was initiated at a rate of 1 liter per minute. The patient was readmitted to the hospital.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Dilara Hatipoglu (Medicine): A 33-year-old man was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of relapsing chronic diarrhea and a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy.\nDiarrhea had initially developed in the patient during infancy. When the patient was 2 months of age, he had poor growth and frequent bowel movements with loose stools. When he began to eat solid foods, diarrhea continued, and a hydrolyzed-protein diet was started. His parents were instructed to remove dairy, soy, and gluten from his diet, but diarrhea did not abate. Allergy skin-prick testing with cow\u2019s milk and soy antigens was negative.\nWhen the patient was 10 months of age, failure to thrive and diarrhea persisted, and generalized edema and nephrotic syndrome developed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and diffuse inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy reportedly showed mild degenerative changes of the surface epithelium and mild focal microvillous atrophy; there were no immune deposits, and the basement membrane was normal.\nRenal biopsy was also performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen revealed glomeruli with diffuse thickening of the basement membrane; there was no proliferation of cells or mesangial matrix. Transmission electron microscopy showed total effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes and an irregularly thickened glomerular basement membrane with numerous subepithelial and intramembranous electron-dense deposits. The patient received a working diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome due to membranous glomerulonephritis, and treatment with prednisone was started.\nDiarrhea abated, proteinuria and generalized edema resolved, and growth resumed. However, during the next 2 years, intermittent relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome occurred when the dose of prednisone was decreased. When the patient was 3 years of age, treatment with chlorambucil was started for recurrent membranous glomerulonephritis, and there were no relapses for 1 year.\nWhen the patient was 4 years of age, there was a recurrence of diarrhea associated with fever and hemolytic anemia. Stool culture, stool testing for Clostridioides difficile toxin, and examination of the stool for ova and parasites were all negative. EGD was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and active enteritis. The blood IgE level was 501 IU per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 100). The blood level of endomysial antibodies was not elevated, but anti\u2013epithelial cell antibodies were detected. The patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy, and treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was begun.\nAfter several months, treatment with glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was stopped, and tacrolimus was begun. Tacrolimus was stopped after several years, when the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved. From 5 to 13 years of age, he had no enteropathy, anemia, or nephropathy.\nBeginning at 13 years of age, the patient was hospitalized for recurrences of diarrhea and nephropathy every 2 to 4 years during the 20 years before this evaluation. Six years before this evaluation, EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the duodenal and colonic mucosa appeared diffusely edematous. Biopsy specimens were obtained.\nDr. Stuti G. Shroff: Examination of a duodenal biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed marked villous blunting, an increase in lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria (known as lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria), and a patchy increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. Examination of a colonic biopsy specimen revealed mild focal active colitis that spared the rectum.\nFIGURE 1\n\nSmall-Intestinal Biopsy Specimens.\nDr. Hatipoglu: Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was begun, and diarrhea abated. For the next 2 years, relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone in combination with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil.\nFour years before this evaluation, antibodies against the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor were not detected. Renal biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen again revealed evidence of membranous glomerulonephritis. Treatment was changed to prednisone, budesonide, and abatacept, and symptoms abated. After 2 years, the patient stopped taking abatacept. After another 2 years, diarrhea recurred, and the patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the gastroenterology clinic, additional history was obtained. There was a history of hypertension, gallstones, and rosacea. Eczema had developed when the patient was 10 months of age and had occurred intermittently into adulthood; it had abated with the administration of immunosuppressive agents. Anaphylactic shock had occurred when the patient was 2 years of age after he had been exposed to uncooked egg. At that time, allergy testing was performed, and the patient\u2019s parents were instructed to remove eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, and shellfish from his diet, in addition to removing dairy, soy, and gluten.\nCurrent medications included prednisone, budesonide, and losartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a Mid-Atlantic state and worked as a salesperson. He did not smoke tobacco and drank beer rarely.

The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.1. The patient had short stature and diffuse erythema of the face and neck. There was mild tenderness in the left lower abdomen. The results of a lactulose breath test were normal, as was the fecal calprotectin level. Testing for antibodies to tissue transglutaminase was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

    "user_input": "Dr. Sunu S. Thomas: A 26-year-old pregnant woman was transferred to this hospital for evaluation and treatment of cardiogenic shock after a cardiac arrest resulting from ventricular tachycardia.\nThe patient had had two previous uncomplicated pregnancies and was currently pregnant at 32 weeks of gestation with monochorionic, diamniotic twins. Her pregnancy had been monitored for polyhydramnios by her obstetrician with the use of serial fetal ultrasonography.\nThree weeks before presentation to this hospital, one of the patient\u2019s preschool-age children had an ear infection and the other had a sore throat. The patient had erythema in the eyes with greenish drainage, for which topical erythromycin and sulfacetamide were prescribed. One week later, a nonproductive cough complicated by a sore throat and ear pain developed. The patient also noted new edema in her legs that was not associated with pain, redness, or warmth. However, during the subsequent week, progressive pain in her right leg occurred, which prompted her to seek care at an emergency department of another hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the pulse 113 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Pitting edema of the legs was noted, with no associated erythema, warmth, or tenderness on palpation of the calves. Ultrasonography of the right leg reportedly showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and a rapid test for streptococcal antigen was negative. While the patient was in the emergency department, painful uterine contractions with back discomfort developed; the cervix was 2 cm dilated. She was admitted to the labor and delivery unit for management of preterm labor. Intramuscular betamethasone and magnesium sulfate were administered for maturation of the fetal lungs and tocolysis, respectively. Continuous intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution was initiated. Subcutaneous heparin was not administered, because delivery was thought to be imminent. After 24 hours of magnesium sulfate therapy, the uterine contractions remained unchanged, and no further cervical dilatation was noted. Because of concern about preterm labor, she remained hospitalized, with continuous monitoring of the fetal heart rate.\nFive days after admission to the labor and delivery unit, the patient had tenderness in the left leg, and the edema in both legs had worsened. She also had episodes of severe coughing but reported no chest pain or shortness of breath. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/51 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed expiratory wheezes. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Doppler ultrasound examination of the legs revealed an occlusive thrombus in the left peroneal vein. The hematology service was consulted, and an intravenous heparin infusion was initiated. Intravenous furosemide and oral azithromycin and guaifenesin were also administered.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (First Hospital), 1 Day before Transfer (First Hospital), Day of Transfer after Cardiac Arrest (First Hospital), Reference Range (This Hospital), On Arrival (This Hospital)\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 11.2\u201315.7, 10.9, 11.0, 12.0\u201316.0, 9.6\nHematocrit (%), 34.1\u201344.9, 32.5, 33.1, 36.0\u201346.0, 28.2\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 132,000, 190,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 158\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 3980\u201310,040, 8920, 12,670, 4500\u201311,000, 19,500\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l),\n\u2003Neutrophils, 1400\u20137700, 6333, 5448, 1800\u20137700, 16,302\n\u2003Lymphocytes, 1100\u20134000, 892, 3928, 1000\u20134800, 1014\n\u2003Eosinophils, 0\u2013700, 89, 127, 0\u2013900, 0\n\u2003Bands, 0\u20134, 714, 1140, 0\u20131100, 838\nSodium (mmol/liter), 136\u2013145, 135, 142, 135\u2013145, 143\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.5\u20135.1, 3.6, 3.8, 3.4\u20135.0, 4.0\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013107, 102, 108, 98\u2013108, 109\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 21\u201332, 20, 19, 23\u201332, 21\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 7\u201318, 9, 8, 8\u201325, 9\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.55\u20131.02, 0.57, 1.0, 0.60\u20131.50, 0.67\nGlucose (mg/dl), 74\u2013100, 98, 152, 70\u2013110, 202\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.1, 7.9, 7.5, 8.5\u201310.5, 6.7\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.4\u20138.2, 4.9, 5.0, 6.0\u20138.3, 3.6\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.4\u20135.0, 1.9, 1.6, 3.3\u20135.0, 1.9\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 5\u201337, 26, 44, 9\u201332, 648\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201365, 25, 31, 7\u201333, 101\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013117, 142, 141, 30\u2013100, 132\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.2\u20131.0, 0.59, 0.28, 0.0\u20131.0, 0.8\nMagnesium (mg/dl), 1.6\u20132.6, \u2014, 2.0, 1.7\u20132.4, 1.8\nProthrombin time (sec), 9.5\u201312.1, \u2014, 10.1, 11.5\u201314.5, 15.0\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.91\u20131.16, \u2014, 0.97, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.2\nPartial-thromboplastin time (sec), 23.9\u201331.3, \u2014, 73.8, 22.0\u201335.0, >150.0\nCentral venous oxygen saturation (%), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 70\u201380, 76.9\nPhosphorus (mg/dl), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 2.6\u20134.5, 4.1\nIonized calcium (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.14\u20131.30, 0.96\nGlobulin (g/dl), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.9\u20134.1, 1.3\nLactic acid (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.5\u20132.2, 1.3\nTroponin T (ng/ml), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, <0.03, 28.32\nCreatine kinase (U/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 40\u2013150, 11,012\nCreatine kinase MB isoenzyme (U/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.0\u20136.9, 552.0\nFibrinogen (mg/dl), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 150\u2013400, 259\nArterial blood gases:\n\u2003Fraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.0, \u2014, 1.0\n\u2003pH, 7.35\u20137.45, \u2014, 7.19, 7.35\u20137.45, 7.31\n\u2003Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 35\u201345, \u2014, 42.7, 35\u201342, 42\n\u2003Partial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 75\u2013100, \u2014, 251.9, 80\u2013100, 449\n\n\nThe next morning, after the patient had eaten breakfast, she had sudden severe, \u201ccrushing\u201d chest pain and became unresponsive and pulseless. Telemetry revealed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 178 beats per minute, with a right bundle-branch block pattern with a superior axis. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and after the administration of epinephrine and cardioversion, the return of spontaneous circulation was achieved within 4 minutes. Intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, propofol, and fentanyl were administered. The trachea was intubated, and ventilatory support was initiated. An emergency cesarean section was performed, and two healthy male infants were delivered, with an estimated intraoperative blood loss of 1600 ml. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Andrew S. Fox: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening, findings that were consistent with pulmonary edema; bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion; cardiomegaly with biventricular enlargement; and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery, which measured 3.8 cm in diameter. No pulmonary embolus was identified.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Chest.\nDr. Thomas: A transthoracic echocardiogram showed biventricular dilatation and severely decreased biventricular systolic function, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion. Furosemide was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to a nearby tertiary care center for further treatment.\nOn arrival at the second hospital, 210 minutes after the cardiac arrest, the pulse was 177 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure was 65 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. Physical examination was notable for diffusely coarse breath sounds, rapid regular heart sounds, and generalized edema. Thirty minutes after arrival at the second hospital, the patient underwent cannulation for femoral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and an intravenous infusion of milrinone was initiated. Ventricular tachycardia recurred; intravenous magnesium and lidocaine were administered, and the arrhythmia was terminated with cardioversion. Plans were made to transfer the patient by helicopter to this hospital, and intravenous vecuronium was given in preparation for transport. During the flight, severe vaginal bleeding developed, and 2 units of packed red cells were transfused; however, the heparin infusion was continued, given the presence of the ECMO circuit.\nOn arrival at this hospital, 10 hours after the cardiac arrest, additional information was obtained from the patient\u2019s sister and grandmother. The patient had a history of childhood asthma, obesity, anxiety, and depression. She had previously delivered two healthy, full-term children; her current pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus and polyhydramnios of one of the fetuses. Her medication history included insulin, inhaled albuterol, sertraline, iron sulfate, and folic acid. She had had no known adverse drug reactions. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was married and had two healthy preschool-age children, in addition to her two newborns. Her mother had died from ovarian cancer; her sister was healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the pulse 123 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure 76 mm Hg without intrinsic arterial pulsatility while the patient was receiving ECMO support. The respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was receiving oxygen through volume assist\u2013control mechanical ventilation, with a delivered tidal volume of 290 ml and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0. The weight was 105 kg, the height 163 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 39.5. The central venous pressure was 4 mm Hg. The pupils were equal and briskly reactive to light; once the patient was weaned off propofol, she was able to follow commands and move her arms and legs. Breath sounds were coarse bilaterally and diminished at the bases. Heart sounds were distant. The abdomen was soft and obese; no active bleeding was noted from the surgical incision, but large-volume vaginal bleeding and clots were observed. The arms and legs were warm and had moderate symmetric pitting edema. The femoral venous and arterial cannulas were secured in place in the right groin. The blood level of thyrotropin was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for influenza viruses, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus were negative.\nDr. Fox: Chest radiography (Figure 1C), performed at the time of transfer to this hospital, revealed interstitial opacities, a small left pleural effusion, and a dense retrocardiac opacity on the left side. The venous ECMO drainage cannula and a central venous catheter were visible in the right atrium.\nDr. Thomas: An electrocardiogram (Figure 2A) showed normal sinus rhythm, right bundle-branch block, borderline-low QRS voltage, and Q waves with T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads.\nFIGURE 2\n\nCardiac Studies.\nDr. Doreen DeFaria Yeh: Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 2B; and Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org), performed while the patient was receiving ECMO support, revealed a dilated left ventricular cavity with normal wall thickness and severe diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis that was most prominent in the anterior, anteroseptal, and lateral territories, with an estimated ejection fraction of 11%. Additional notable findings included moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, moderate right ventricular dysfunction and dilatation, an estimated pulmonary-artery systolic pressure of 53 mm Hg, a small pericardial effusion, and a pleural effusion. The ECMO inflow cannula was visualized in the inferior vena cava, and consistent with systemic ECMO blood flows, the aortic valve was observed not to open during the cardiac cycle, which suggested very poor native left ventricular contraction. There was no evidence of intracardiac shunting.\nDr. Thomas: The dose of milrinone was increased, and the dopamine infusion was discontinued. An oxytocin infusion and rectal misoprostol were administered. Ongoing large-volume vaginal bleeding was observed, and an intrauterine balloon was placed to control the bleeding.\nA diagnosis and management decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Neelam A. Phadke: A 54-year-old woman with a history of episodic swelling of the arms, hands, and feet was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\nTwenty-three years before the current presentation, swelling of the left hand developed after the patient sustained a human bite. The swelling was associated with mild pruritus, erythema, and warmth. The swelling was well demarcated, involved only the left hand, and resolved after 3 days without specific treatment.\nTwenty-two years before the current presentation, the patient had epigastric pain that radiated to her back, with associated nausea. Results of an upper gastrointestinal series, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were reportedly normal. The abdominal pain resolved, but two similar self-limited episodes occurred during the next year. No cause for the abdominal pain was identified.\nDuring the next 3 years, episodes of self-limited swelling occurred once per year; one episode involved the right foot, one the left hand, and one the right hand. There were no clear triggers for the episodes, although they tended to occur after exposure to cold or after minor trauma, such as scratching.\nEighteen years before the current presentation, episodes of swelling of the hands and feet began to occur on a monthly basis, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital after an episode of swelling of the left hand. A skin-biopsy specimen reportedly showed sparse superficial dermal perivascular and interstitial mixed inflammatory infiltrate and stromal edema. Treatment with prednisone was initiated. The swelling of the left hand resolved after 3 days, and the patient was referred to the allergy clinic of this hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency was made on the basis of low levels of C1 esterase inhibitor, C4, and C1q. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal, and tests for antinuclear antibodies were negative. The patient was evaluated in the allergy clinic of a third hospital, and treatment with daily danazol was initiated. The episodes of swelling of the hands and feet resolved.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (This Hospital, 18 Yr before the Current Presentation), 18 Yr before the Current Presentation (This Hospital), Reference Range (Third Hospital, 10 Yr before the Current Presentation), 10 Yr before the Current Presentation (Third Hospital)\n\nTotal complement (U/ml), 63\u2013145, 129, 150\u2013250, 149\nC3 (mg/dl), 86\u2013184, 159, 90\u2013180, 152\nC4 (mg/dl), 20\u201358, <10, 10\u201340, 8\nC2 (mg/dl), 1.58\u20133.92, 2.45, 1.58\u20133.92, 1.6\nC1 inhibitor level (mg/dl), 12.4\u201324.5, 2.4, 21\u201339, 7\nC1 inhibitor function, Present, Present, Present, Present\nC1q (mg/dl), 8\u201312, 6.9, 8\u201312, 7\n\nTen years before the current presentation, episodes of swelling of the eyelids and upper lip occurred with associated pruritus. The episodes began with a sensation of facial flushing, pruritus of the scalp, and a raised pruritic rash on the face and chest; at times, these episodes were accompanied by shortness of breath, chest tightness, itchy throat, and red eyes. The patient was evaluated in the allergy clinic of the third hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The dose of danazol was increased, and the patient was instructed to take hydroxyzine as needed during episodes of swelling that were associated with pruritus.\nThe swelling episodes associated with pruritus occurred with variable frequency (several times per week to once every few months) but resolved within 30 minutes after the administration of hydroxyzine. Cetirizine was substituted for hydroxyzine for acute episodes. Treatment with daily loratadine and ranitidine was initiated, and the episodes of swelling with pruritus decreased in frequency.\nFour months before the current presentation, swelling of the right arm developed after venipuncture. There was no associated pruritus. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. Ultrasonography of the arm showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and the patient was discharged from the emergency department. The swelling resolved after 3 days.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed. The patient attributed her symptoms to food poisoning, since her daughter had similar symptoms; the symptoms resolved after 3 days.\nOne week before the current presentation, epigastric pain developed; the pain was burning in character, worsened with consumption of food, and abated with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient was evaluated at a fourth hospital, where CT of the abdomen reportedly revealed inflammation of the duodenum and jejunum. A proton-pump inhibitor was administered, and the abdominal pain decreased. The patient was instructed not to take NSAIDs and was discharged home. However, during the next week, abdominal pain recurred, along with new symptoms of poor appetite and early satiety. She presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further care.\nOther history included hypertension, low-back pain, and osteoporosis; she had undergone previous appendectomy and cesarean section. The patient also had a subepithelial duodenal mass, measuring 7 mm in diameter, that had been stable in size during the past 5 years; ultrasonographic images had shown that the mass was consistent with a benign stromal cell neoplasm. Medications included amlodipine, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, omeprazole, ranitidine, loratadine, and danazol, as well as cetirizine as needed. The patient had no known medication allergies but was allergic to iodinated contrast material. She was originally from Bangladesh and now lived with her husband and two children in a suburban community in New England and worked as a teacher. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension. The patient reported no similar episodes of swelling in either of her parents.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 106/81 mm Hg, the pulse 74 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was mildly distended with normal bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness on palpation, without rebound or involuntary guarding. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of lipase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, troponin, and thyrotropin. The alanine aminotransferase level was 49 IU per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and the aspartate aminotransferase level was 52 IU per liter (reference range, 9 to 32).\nDr. Ravi Gottumukkala: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of oral or intravenous contrast material, revealed long-segment marked circumferential thickening of the jejunal wall with associated mesenteric edema and small-volume free intraperitoneal fluid. The remainder of the small bowel and colon showed no abnormalities (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Abdomen and Pelvis.\nDr. Phadke: Diagnostic tests were performed, and treatment decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Lara Basovic: A 41-year-old man was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) of this hospital because of seizures.\nWhen the patient was 4 years of age, his mother noticed an episode of staring and unresponsiveness. At 19 years of age, he was the driver in a single-vehicle accident in which the car rolled over. The patient did not recall the events or seek medical evaluation after the accident. Approximately 15 years before this admission, the patient received a diagnosis of epilepsy when episodes of staring to the left and unresponsiveness occurred. The seizures were preceded by a \u201cbad feeling\u201d in the epigastric region and were followed by confusion, agitation, or somnolence. An electroencephalogram (EEG) reportedly revealed bitemporal sharp waves, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head reportedly showed possible asymmetry in the temporal horns. The focal seizures initially occurred weekly and progressed to generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures. During the subsequent 15 years, the patient received treatment with various medications and adjusted doses of various antiseizure medications, and seizures occurred approximately once per month.\nDuring the 3 months before this admission, the frequency of seizures increased to up to three times monthly, despite adherence to his prescribed medications, which included carbamazepine, levetiracetam, and topiramate. The patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of another hospital, and the doses of carbamazepine and levetiracetam were increased.\nFour weeks before this admission, the patient had had five seizures in 2 weeks. Two weeks before this admission, coworkers witnessed shaking of his arms and legs and called emergency medical services. The patient was transported to the emergency department of the other hospital. He received a prescription for diazepam, which was to be taken as needed at night for insomnia, and was discharged home.\nThe next day, the patient\u2019s neurologist was commuting to his office when he spotted the patient stumbling on the side of the road. The patient was behaving erratically and did not respond to questions or commands. Law enforcement was called, and the patient tried to run away. He was restrained and taken to the emergency department of the other hospital. The behavior and confusion resolved, and the patient was referred to the EMU of this hospital for additional evaluation.\nOn the day of this scheduled admission, the patient described stress at work, inadequate sleep, and adherence to his prescribed antiseizure medications. On a review of systems, he noted that he had had \u201cblurriness\u201d of memory for a few days after each seizure; however, he had been able to function well at work. He had no fever, chills, malaise, or headache. During the admission interview, the patient said that something strange was about to happen. His vision became blurred, and both thighs moved nonrhythmically. The patient was aware of these events and noted that they were not typical symptoms of his seizures.\nThe patient had no known medical problems other than epilepsy. Medications included carbamazepine, topiramate, levetiracetam, and cholecalciferol, as well as diazepam as needed for sleep. He had no known drug allergies. The patient was born in a Caribbean country and had moved to coastal New England 5 years before this admission to live with his mother and aunt. He worked as a skilled tradesman. He did not drink alcohol, use illicit drugs, or smoke cigarettes. His two sisters were healthy, and his maternal grandmother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease. There was no family history of seizures or psychiatric disease. The results of a physical examination, including vital signs, mental status, mood, and affect, were normal.\nDr. Javier M. Romero: The initial MRI of the head revealed decreased volume of the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus with increased signal intensity on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging. Ex-vacuo dilatation of the left temporal horn was present, which was most likely secondary to the volume loss (Figure 1A). Interictal positron-emission tomography of the head was performed, which showed subtle reduction of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the left mesial temporal lobe (Figure 1B).\nFigure 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies and EEG.\nDr. Basovic: During the patient\u2019s first 3 days at this hospital, the doses of carbamazepine and levetiracetam were decreased gradually, and topiramate was continued. No electroclinical or electrographic seizures were observed (Figure 1C). During the fourth and fifth hospital days, the dose of carbamazepine was further decreased, and levetiracetam was stopped. A total of five seizures were observed, with staring and subtle movements in both legs that occurred for up to 3 minutes. EEG was performed, which revealed that most electroclinical seizure events originated from the left temporal lobe focus (Figure 2A); one event originated from the right temporal lobe (Figure 2B). After the second seizure, the patient tried to remove the EEG electrodes and leave the room. He bit and kicked the clinicians who tried to stop him. Security personnel were called, and intravenous haloperidol and lorazepam were administered. Between seizures, the patient was calm and cooperative without agitation. The dose of carbamazepine was increased.\nFigure 2\n\nEEGs Obtained during Hospital Course.\nOn the patient\u2019s sixth hospital day, the blood pressure increased to 160/100 mm Hg, and the pulse increased to 120 beats per minute. Sixteen hours after the fifth seizure, he pressed the seizure alarm button three times during episodes of leg weakness and \u201cfoggy\u201d vision. He answered questions with one-word answers and held his hand to his chest, saying that his heart felt \u201coff.\u201d He had auditory hallucinations of a keyboard playing and stated, \u201cPlease don\u2019t fire those three girls.\u201d Treatment with oral labetalol and lorazepam was started, and the dose of carbamazepine was further increased.\nOn the seventh hospital day, the patient dismantled a metal piece from the table in his room. He then held the door closed and refused to allow staff to enter and threatened them. When a staff member approached the patient, he struck that person with the metal piece. Security personnel were called, intravenous haloperidol was administered, and the patient was temporarily placed into four-point restraints. The dose of carbamazepine was further increased, treatment with levetiracetam was restarted, and risperidone was started.\nThe agitation resolved, and additional history was obtained. The patient explained his combative behavior by stating, \u201cI thought they were trying to kill me,\u201d and also said, \u201cThat\u2019s not me.\u201d He was concerned about the staff member who was struck and asked if that person was hurt. He had had no previous episodes of anger or violence, although he frequently had a feeling of fearfulness after seizures that made him want to be away from other people and on his own. He did not report auditory or visual hallucinations or paranoia, and he had never received a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder.\nDuring the subsequent 3 days, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, and topiramate were administered at the preadmission doses, treatment with lorazepam was continued, and clobazam was started. He intermittently declined to take medications, especially the medications that were started in the hospital, such as labetalol and risperidone. Treatment with oral carbamazepine was transitioned to intravenous lacosamide. The patient had additional episodes of foggy vision, anxiety, restlessness, impulsivity, and agitation. He perseverated on the idea that God had saved him. He insisted that he needed to call his mother to tell her that \u201cit\u2019s the end.\u201d He asked her for help because he believed he would be killed in the hospital. He was seen trying to eat a mobile telephone. Two-point and four-point restraints were placed intermittently.",

Roberts: A 41-year-old woman who had undergone renal transplantation was admitted to this hospital because of bloody stools and thrombocytopenia.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 weeks before this admission, when mild rectal discomfort and nonbloody diarrhea developed. The episodes of diarrhea occurred several times a day and were not associated with fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.\nTwo weeks before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at this hospital. The abdominal and rectal examinations were normal. The hemoglobin level was 11.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 14.0 to 18.0) and the platelet count 129,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Stool cultures and tests of the stool for Clostridioides difficile antigen and toxin and Shiga toxin were negative, as was examination of the stool for ova and parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with docusate was stopped, treatment with topical rectal hydrocortisone cream was started, and a recommendation was made to increase the amount of fiber in the diet. During the next week, the episodes of diarrhea decreased in frequency to once a day; however, the rectal pain persisted.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (This Hospital), 2 Wk before Admission, On Admission\n\nBlood\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 129,000, 0\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 7500, 8490\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 6428, 6920\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 255, 1120\nMonocytes, 20\u2013120, 803, 300\nEosinophils, 0\u2013900, 8, 0\nBasophils, 0\u2013300, 8, 80\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 14.0\u201318.0, 11.0, 6.0\nHematocrit (%), 42.0\u201352.0, 32.9, 19.6\nMean corpuscular volume (fl), 80.0\u2013100.0, \u2014, 74.5\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin (pg), 26.0\u201334.0, \u2014, 22.8\nRed-cell distribution width (%), 11.5\u201314.5, \u2014, 14.8\nReticulocytes (%), 0.7\u20132.5, \u2014, 1.3\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 0\u201341, \u2014, 80\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201350, \u2014, 104\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.5\u20135.2, \u2014, 2.5\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, \u2014, 0.5\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/liter), 110\u2013210, \u2014, 465\nHaptoglobin (mg/dl), 30\u2013200, \u2014, 38\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, \u2014, 13.9\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, \u2014, 1.1\nActivated partial-thromboplastin time (sec), 22.0\u201336.0, \u2014, 33.2\nFibrinogen (mg/dl), 150\u2013400, \u2014, 288\nD-Dimer (ng/ml), <500, \u2014, 1650\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.86, 0.85\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 11, 12\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 3.7, 4.2\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 135, 132\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 196, 234\n\nUrine:\nBilirubin, Negative, \u2014, Negative\nUrobilinogen, Negative, \u2014, Negative\nBlood, Negative, \u2014, 2+\nGlucose, Negative, \u2014, 1+\nKetones, Negative, \u2014, 1+\nLeukocyte esterase, Negative, \u2014, Negative\nNitrites, Negative, \u2014, Negative\n\nOne week before this admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician because the rectal pain had worsened; she was unable to sit down, and new tenesmus was present. A rectal examination revealed mild tenderness and thin yellow-brown liquid stool, with no evidence of blood or an external anal injury. A radiograph of the abdomen was normal. Docusate, senna, and topical lidocaine jelly were prescribed.\nThree days before this admission, bowel movements with tarry black and loose maroon stools and dark clots began to occur multiple times a day. When the episodes increased in frequency to every hour and there was bright-red blood per rectum, the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported severe rectal pain and burning, as well as fatigue, dizziness, and weakness. She did not report fever, chills, abdominal pain, hematemesis, hemoptysis, epistaxis, rash, bruising, hematuria, or menorrhagia.\nThe patient was congenitally deaf. She had received a diagnosis of kidney disease 12 years earlier, when proteinuria and hypertension developed during pregnancy and did not resolve postpartum. Pathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen had reportedly revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The patient was presumed to have Alport\u2019s syndrome; no genetic testing had been performed.\nTen years before the current evaluation, the patient had discontinued all prescribed medications, including prednisone and labetalol, without talking to her doctors; 3 years later, she presented to this hospital with dyspnea on exertion and end-stage renal failure. Hemodialysis was started and continued until a deceased-donor renal transplantation was performed 6 months before the current evaluation.\nRoutine pretransplantation serologic testing of the patient revealed IgG antibodies to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and no antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV). Serologic testing of the donor also revealed IgG antibodies to EBV and no antibodies to CMV. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin, belatacept, prednisone, and everolimus was initiated; famciclovir was administered for 3 months after transplantation. Treatment with prednisone was stopped 2 months after transplantation, when diabetes developed.\nAt the time of the current evaluation, medications included aspirin, linagliptin, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, and omeprazole, as well as cholecalciferol, docusate, senna, topical hydrocortisone cream, and topical lidocaine jelly. The dose of everolimus had been decreased 1 month before this evaluation; belatacept had last been infused 2 weeks earlier. There were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived with her male partner and young son in an urban area of New England. She had not traveled recently. She had previously worked part-time as a teacher. There had been no exposure to animals other than two pet dogs. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol. Her sister was deaf and had a history of renal failure that had led to renal transplantation. Her father had a history of diabetes and renal failure that required hemodialysis.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 85/46 mm Hg, the pulse 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared pale and unwell. There was no jaundice or lymphadenopathy. There were palatal petechiae and sublingual ecchymoses, but there was no bleeding from the gums or nose. There was a healed surgical incision in the right lower abdomen and no tenderness over the renal allograft. A rectal examination revealed tenderness and dark blood with clots.\nThe hemoglobin level was 6.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 0 per microliter. A peripheral-blood smear showed red cells that were generally normal in size and morphology, with few hypochromic cells and rare pencil cells; there were no schistocytes or platelets. A direct antiglobulin test was negative. Blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Onofrio A. Catalano: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no bowel-wall thickening or distention. The spleen and liver were normal in size. The renal allograft was visible in the right lower quadrant (Figure 1). The transplanted kidney was enlarged and surrounded by extensive perinephric fat stranding. A small amount of free fluid was also present. There was moderate hydroureteronephrosis that extended up to the ureterovesical anastomosis. The renal collecting system, pelvis, and ureter contained spontaneously hyperdense material that was suggestive of blood breakdown products. No obstructing calculi were seen.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Renal Allograft.\nDr. Roberts: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the blood pressure increased to 97/53 mm Hg. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with everolimus and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was stopped. During the next 24 hours, 4 units of packed red cells and 5 units of pooled platelets were transfused. On the second hospital day, the hemoglobin level was 11.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 4 per microliter.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

Sumner (Pediatrics): An 8-week-old male infant was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital because of inconsolable crying, lethargy, weakness, and hypoxemia.\nThe patient had been well until 7 days before the current presentation, when irritability and frequent crying developed. One day before the current presentation, the episodes of crying increased in duration, and the patient\u2019s grandmother noticed that he cried more intensely when the right side of his abdomen was touched. The patient was evaluated at the pediatric primary care clinic of another hospital. The vital signs and physical examination were reportedly normal, and a diagnosis of discomfort due to gastrointestinal gas was considered.\nAfter the patient returned home, he had a crying episode that lasted for multiple hours while he was awake; the crying stopped while he was fully asleep. After he woke up, the crying continued for 8 hours and became weaker. During breast-feeding, the patient fed less vigorously than usual, and the latch onto the nipple was weaker. That night, the crying continued, and the patient became inconsolable. He had frantic movements of the arms and legs and slept only 1 hour. On the day of the current presentation, the inconsolable crying continued. The patient did not latch onto the nipple, and his mother expressed breast milk directly into his mouth. A family member called the pediatric primary care clinic and was instructed to bring the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family members. There had been no change in the frequency of wet diapers; the last bowel movement had occurred 2 days before this presentation. The patient had been born at a gestational age of 39 weeks 1 day by a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery after a normal pregnancy. The birth weight had been 4.5 kg (98th percentile), the length 54.6 cm (99th percentile), and the head circumference 36.5 cm (94th percentile). The patient had met normal developmental milestones. He had not yet received the routine immunizations recommended for 2-month-old infants. Medications included vitamin D supplements; there were no known medication allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with his grandmother, who primarily cared for him, as well as his mother, father, and sister. His mother had depression, anxiety, and anemia. His father and sister were healthy.\nOn examination, the axillary temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/76 mm Hg, the heart rate 153 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 7.1 kg (99th percentile), the height 62.5 cm (>99th percentile), and the head circumference 41.5 cm (99th percentile). The patient was alert but irritable. He cried weakly and could not be soothed. The anterior fontanelle was open, soft, and flat. The mucous membranes were moist. The heart rate was tachycardic and regular. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft, with no hepatosplenomegaly. The results of the testicular examination were normal. There was no rash.\nThe blood levels of glucose, lactic acid, lipase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 621,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000); the remainder of the complete blood count and differential count was normal. The results of urinalysis and urine toxicology screening were normal. Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza A and B viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

He was admitted to this hospital. Four hours after presentation, lethargy developed. Additional testing was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture was performed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The CSF glucose level was 54 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and the CSF protein level was 104 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55); there were 1055 red cells per microliter and 2 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 70% were lymphocytes. A diagnosis of meningitis was considered. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir was started.\nSix hours after presentation, increased work of breathing developed, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 100%. The patient was transferred to the PICU.\nDr. Sarah A. Murphy: On arrival at the PICU, the patient was difficult to arouse. He had grunting respirations, head-bobbing, intercostal retractions, and an exaggerated abdominal breathing pattern. With vigorous stimulation, the patient had a weak hypophonic cry, gurgling, and stertor on inspiration. Ptosis was present in both eyes. When the eyes were opened by the examiner, the pupils were equal, round, and reactive. The face appeared symmetric and placid. There were few spontaneous movements of the arms, and the patient did not move his arms against gravity. There was no spontaneous movement of the legs, and diffuse hypotonia was present. Muscle bulk was normal and symmetric. Reflexes were decreased but preserved.\nTracheal intubation was performed, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Tachycardia and hypertension persisted despite the administration of boluses of sedative and analgesic agents and the initiation of continuous infusions of opioids and benzodiazepines.\nA diagnostic test was performed.",

Castle: A 70-year-old woman with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was evaluated in a clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, because of cough, shortness of breath, and malaise.\nFifteen years before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of HIV infection after she had presented with substantial weight loss and fatigue. The initial CD4 cell count obtained at the time of diagnosis was 29 cells per microliter (reference range, 332 to 1642). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) with stavudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz was started. During the subsequent year, the symptoms resolved, the HIV RNA level became undetectable, and the patient reported adherence to her medications. Ten years before the current presentation, additional ART became accessible within South Africa, and the ART regimen was changed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz.\nFive years before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to a local hospital because of diarrhea and diffuse myalgias, and she was found to have virologic failure. The ART regimen was changed to zidovudine, lamivudine, and lopinavir\u2013ritonavir. During the subsequent 4 years, the patient reported adherence to these medications without a lapse in treatment. The HIV RNA level ranged from 68 to 594,000 copies per milliliter of plasma (reference value, undetectable).\nTwelve months before the current presentation, the patient had new shortness of breath, cough, anorexia, and weight loss. During the subsequent 4 weeks, the symptoms progressively increased in severity. When the shortness of breath worsened to the extent that she was unable to walk, she sought evaluation at the clinic. The temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 104/64 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 16.9. On examination, the patient appeared ill but was able to speak in full sentences. Auscultation of the chest was limited because of frequent coughing; diffuse crackles were present in both lungs.\nNucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear of the sputum was positive for mycobacteria, and subsequent nucleic acid testing and culture of the sputum was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. In accordance with recommendations from the South African Department of Health, the patient was instructed to isolate at home and complete a course of treatment for tuberculosis, which included rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable,Reference Range,11 Mo before Current Presentation,4 Mo before Current Presentation,On Current Presentation\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12.0\u201315.0, 9.6, \u2014, 7.6\nHematocrit (%), 36.0\u201346.0, 29.3, \u2014, 24.5\nMean corpuscular volume (fl), 78.9\u201398.5, 97.7, \u2014, 99.6\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 186,000\u2013454,000, 146,000, \u2014, 104,000\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 3900\u201312,600, 1900, \u2014, 1960\n\nCD4 cell count:\nRelative count (%), 28.00\u201351.00, 0.87, \u2014, 2.31\nAbsolute count (per \u00b5l), 332\u20131642, 6, \u2014, 6\n\nHIV RNA (copies/ml of plasma), 0\u201320, \u2014, 151,000, 793\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), 0\u201310, 38, \u2014, 14\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201310, 122, \u2014, \u2014\nCryptococcal antigen, serum lateral flow assay, Negative, Negative, \u2014, \u2014\n\nDuring the subsequent 6 months, the patient took the antimycobacterial medications, and the shortness of breath and cough decreased but still persisted. Her weight decreased by 8 kg, even though the anorexia had resolved. Four months before the current presentation, new headaches and mouth ulcers developed, and the patient sought evaluation at the clinic. A sputum specimen was obtained for examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear and mycobacterial nucleic acid testing and culture, all of which were negative. The HIV RNA level was 151,000 copies per milliliter of plasma. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment.\nTwelve days before the current presentation, the patient presented to the clinic for follow-up, and the ART regimen was changed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. When the symptoms did not abate, the patient presented to the clinic for additional evaluation. She described persistent shortness of breath and dry cough, as well as headaches on the right side and mouth ulcers. The review of systems was notable for fatigue and weakness during the past 12 months, as well as fever, night sweats, chest pain, mouth ulcers, and odynophagia. She had no ageusia, anosmia, vision changes, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, or joint pain. Radiography of the chest had not been performed.\nThe patient had not received vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). She took tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolutegravir, as well as acetaminophen for muscle pain as needed. There were no known drug allergies. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs; she did not take any remedies from traditional healers. The patient lived with her daughter in a rural farming community in a coastal region of South Africa, and she had not traveled recently. She commuted by foot within her community and had regular exposure to cattle, goats, chickens, and dogs. Her household water supply originated from a borehole and was untreated.\nOn examination, the patient was alert but appeared ill and cachectic. She coughed throughout the interview. The blood pressure was 97/71 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. The body-mass index was 13.7. The mucous membranes were dry. She had thrush on the tongue, as well as superficial ulcers on the buccal mucosa. On auscultation of the chest, diffuse crackles were present in both lungs and were worst in the right lower lobe. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal.

Bilateral, frontal, pulsatile headache developed suddenly and reached maximal intensity within seconds. The patient rated the pain at 10 (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain) and noted that it was the worst headache pain that she had ever had. The pain was so severe that she could not complete her sentence. She sat down, feeling as though she might faint because of the severity of the pain. She repeatedly told her husband, \u201cSomething is really wrong.\u201d Nausea developed without emesis. When the symptoms did not abate after 30 minutes, emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing headache and nausea. Medical history included hypertension and cervical disk disease with chronic neck pain. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide and oral conjugated estrogens, which the patient took every 3 days for symptoms of menopause. She had no known allergies. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. She lived with her husband and worked as an administrative assistant. Her mother had diabetes. There was no family history of venous thromboembolism.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 157/77 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The neck was supple. She was oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. The visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The visualized portions of the retina were normal in both eyes with normal-appearing optic disks. Tests of motor strength and sensation showed normal results, as did tests of reflexes and cerebellar function. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count with differential count and the results of tests of kidney function and coagulation. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Javier M. Romero: Two hours after the onset of headache, computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1), revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left superior parietal lobule and paramedian parietal sulci.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT Scan of the Head, Obtained during the Initial Presentation.\nDr. DiCarlo: Treatment with intravenous morphine and promethazine was administered. Nausea resolved, and the headache pain abated. Four hours after the onset of headache, the blood pressure was 136/45 mm Hg. Additional laboratory studies were obtained. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 8 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), the blood level of C-reactive protein 2.7 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the blood level of troponin T 0.36 ng per milliliter (reference value, <0.03). Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block and diffuse submillimeter ST-segment depressions.\nAdditional testing was performed, and a diagnosis was made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Kathy M. Tran (Medicine): A 21-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of fatigue, weight gain, and abdominal pain.\nThe patient had been well until 4 months before the current evaluation, when an episode of dull, aching pain in the right lower quadrant occurred. The pain lasted for a few hours before resolving spontaneously. During the next 4 months, episodes of abdominal pain continued to occur and increased in duration, frequency, and severity. The patient sought evaluation in the gynecology clinic of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient described the pain as variable, rating it between 3 and 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The episodes of pain occurred daily and lasted for up to 20 hours. The pain decreased with sitting or lying down and did not increase with movement; it was not associated with her menstrual period. The patient also reported fatigue, irritability, and weight gain of 4.5 kg in the previous 4 months despite increased exercise and decreased food intake.\nThere was a history of hypothyroidism, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and migraines. The patient had never been pregnant and had no known history of sexually transmitted infections or abnormal results on screening tests for cervical cancer. She had previously been sexually active with male partners, but she reported no current sexual activity. She had taken oral contraceptives for 2 years but had stopped taking them 6 months before this evaluation, when a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) was placed. Other medications included levothyroxine, citalopram, and multivitamins; there were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived with roommates in an urban area of New England. She was a former athlete and worked as a research scientist. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her mother, coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia in her father, breast cancer and diabetes in her paternal grandmother, and lung cancer in her paternal grandfather.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 119/73 mm Hg and the heart rate 62 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The thyroid was firm on palpation, with a small nodule noted on the right side. The abdomen was nondistended, soft, and nontender. A small hernia with a thrill was noted at the right inguinal ring. A speculum examination of the vagina and cervix was normal; IUD strings were visible at the cervical os. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes and glucose and results of tests for kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis were negative. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Madeleine Sertic: Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass (measuring 4.8 cm by 5.0 cm by 3.9 cm) along the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe (Figure 1A). The uterus, ovaries, and adnexa were normal. There was no free fluid in the pelvis, and the IUD was in an appropriate position.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a right adrenal mass (measuring 4.5 cm by 4.7 cm by 4.0 cm) that was T2 isointense (Figure 1B) and T1 hypointense. The mass had diffusion restriction (Figure 1C), as well as early enhancement with washout, which refers to the temporal reduction in the enhancement of a lesion. The features were indeterminate and were not definitively diagnostic of adrenal adenoma or another adrenal lesion, such as pheochromocytoma or adrenocortical carcinoma.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis again revealed a right adrenal mass, which had a density of 33 Hounsfield units (HU) before the administration of contrast material (Figure 1D), 74 HU during the portal-venous phase (Figure 1E), and 45 HU during the 15-minute delayed phase (Figure 1F). The absolute washout was calculated as 71%. The absolute washout is calculated by dividing the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the delayed-phase density by the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the unenhanced density and then converting the result to a percentage: [(HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU delayed phase) / (HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU unenhanced)] \u00d7 100. Adrenal adenomas tend to wash out faster than other adrenal lesions, and an absolute washout of more than 60% is highly suggestive of an adrenal adenoma. However, lesions larger than 4 cm are likely to be malignant, regardless of the washout characteristics.1 There was also a thin-walled cyst (measuring 3.3 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the left lung.\nDr. Tran: The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Additional laboratory tests were performed to further evaluate the adrenal mass. Blood levels of renin and aldosterone were normal, as were urinary levels of catecholamines and metanephrines. An overnight, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed. The baseline blood corticotropin level was 3 pg per milliliter (0.7 pmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 76 pg per milliliter [1.3 to 16.7 pmol per liter]). At 11 p.m., dexamethasone (1 mg) was administered; at 8 a.m., the blood cortisol level was 9.1 \u03bcg per deciliter (251 nmol per liter; reference value, <1.8 \u03bcg per deciliter [50 nmol per liter]), and the concurrent blood dexamethasone level was 631 ng per deciliter (reference range, 140 to 295). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 31.0 \u03bcg (reference range, 3.5 to 45.0); the blood levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were normal.\nManagement decisions were made.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Claudio M. de Gusmao: A 69-year-old man was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of progressively worsening ataxia.\nThe patient had been well until 9 years before this evaluation, when abnormal gait and impaired coordination developed. He was unable to walk in a straight line; he bumped into walls when walking down a hallway. He also had difficulty reading traffic signs while driving and noted a change in the quality of his voice. The patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of another hospital and began physical therapy.\nDuring the next several years, symptoms gradually worsened despite physical therapy. The patient was no longer able to drive or play golf, and he intermittently used a walker because of unsteadiness. He had frequent falls, including one that led to fractures in six ribs. His speech changes worsened, such that he could no longer sing. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the neurology clinic, the patient reported frequent bowel movements, approximately 10 per day. He had no vertigo, lightheadedness, hearing loss, tremor, erectile dysfunction, disturbance of sleep, or urinary incontinence. He reported a sense of visual disorientation with head movement and with changes in the direction of gaze. He had a history of hyperlipidemia. Medications included atorvastatin, cetirizine, and a multivitamin; there were no known drug allergies. The patient had recently moved from an urban area in the southeastern United States to a suburban area of New England. He drank one glass of wine nightly; additional alcohol use caused worsening of ataxia and dysarthria. He had previously smoked five cigarettes daily but had quit smoking 30 years before this evaluation; he did not use illicit drugs.\nThe patient\u2019s mother had died of heart failure at an elderly age, and his father had died after a stroke and myocardial infarction at 70 years of age. The patient had two adult children, who were healthy. His two brothers and one of his sisters had celiac disease; the sister also reportedly had a shuffling gait. The sister\u2019s daughter had received a diagnosis of Turner\u2019s syndrome and had been seen by a neurologist for a balance disturbance. A brother\u2019s grandson also had celiac disease and a gait disturbance (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nFamily History.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg, and the pulse 72 beats per minute. The patient was alert, oriented, and attentive and provided a detailed history. He had moderate dysarthria, with impairment in the rate, rhythm, and clarity of speech. An oculomotor examination revealed complete and conjugate gaze in all directions; he had intact smooth pursuit movements but had slow, dysmetric saccades. Results of a head impulse test were abnormal, with corrective saccades noted bilaterally. Normal tone and full strength were present in all major muscle groups of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric at the knees but absent at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Rapid tapping of the index fingers on the thumbs was dysrhythmic and uncoordinated. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing revealed mild intention tremor. Heel-to-shin testing revealed symmetric jerking movements with lateral movements across the shins. Vibration and joint-position senses in the legs were profoundly decreased: the patient was unable to sense vibration at the toes, had a decreased ability to sense vibration at the knees, and had difficulty discerning the position of his big toe with his eyes closed. There was sway in his stance, regardless of whether his eyes were open, and he could not stand with the feet together. The patient walked without support. He had a wide-based gait with considerable staggering and jerky, stiff movements of the legs. He was unable to maintain balance in a tandem stance or to walk with a tandem gait.\nThe complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were test results for kidney, liver, and thyroid function; antibodies to thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin were not detected. Blood levels of cyanocobalamin, methylmalonic acid, vitamin E, and glycated hemoglobin were normal; anti\u2013glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were not detected. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Genetic testing revealed no mutations in genes associated with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8. Clinical testing of otolith function revealed abnormal vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials on the left side. Nerve-conduction studies revealed absent or barely detectable responses in the bilateral sural nerves, left superficial peroneal nerve, left median nerve, left ulnar nerve, and right radial nerve. Results of motor nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were results of a modified barium-swallow evaluation. A previous workup at another hospital for chronic diarrhea had reportedly been normal, with no evidence of malabsorption.\nDr. McKinley Glover: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss and prominent cerebellar volume loss, most notably involving the vermis and superior cerebellar hemispheres. There was mild flattening of the superior margin of the midbrain, and the ratio of midbrain to ventral pons was mildly reduced at 0.51 (reference range, >0.52).1 The anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain was 8.90 mm (reference range, >9.35).1 There was no abnormal signal in the pons, and the middle cerebellar peduncles were normal. There was a chronic lacunar infarct of the right thalamus.\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. de Gusmao: Additional history was obtained, and a diagnosis was made.",

He had fever with temperatures of up to 38.2\u00b0C, along with chills and diaphoresis. He took naproxen, and the next day, he presented to an urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 175/95 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Symptoms abated after 3 days, but then fever with temperatures of up to 38.3\u00b0C and fatigue occurred. The patient stopped consuming alcohol.\nThree weeks later, the patient had episodes of mild dyspnea with \u201ccoughing fits\u201d and presented to a second urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 59 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/75 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued, but the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Another test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, and the results of urinalysis and chest radiography were normal.\nThe next day, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician at another hospital. He reported a 1-month history of \u201cstabbing\u201d back pain between his shoulders, which was worst at the end of the day and was not relieved with the use of naproxen or a heating pad. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 48 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There was tenderness on palpation of the left thoracic paraspinal area, but the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Radiographic images of the thoracic spine were reportedly normal. Laboratory test results obtained at that time are shown in Table 1, alongside routine test results obtained 6 months earlier.

He also reported a history of dysuria that was attributed to chronic prostatitis, as well as pain in the left wrist and knee that was attributed to gout. He reported no weight loss, sweats, palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest discomfort, joint swelling or redness, rash, headache, focal neurologic symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, hypertension with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, palpitations, unprovoked pulmonary embolism, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperuricemia, latent tuberculosis, malaria, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, Helicobacter pylori infection, colonic schistosomiasis, prostatism, and thrombocytopenia. His last dental procedure had taken place more than 2 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, metoprolol, and losartan, as well as sildenafil as needed. He had received two vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), with the second vaccine administered 7 months before the current evaluation. There were no known adverse reactions to medication.\nThe patient grew up in equatorial Central Africa. He had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier and had not returned to Africa for more than 5 years. He was employed at a local university and occasionally had contact with college students. He lived with his family in a suburb of Boston. During the summer months, he had visited islands in Massachusetts and coastal wooded areas to hike, camp, and swim. The patient reported that he had encountered many ticks but had not received a tick bite. He had been scratched by cats; there were no other animal exposures. In the past, he had consumed two or three beers daily, but he had stopped all alcohol intake during the previous month. He had never used tobacco or illicit substances. His family history was notable for atherosclerotic coronary disease.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 46 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.4. He appeared comfortable. Auscultation of the chest revealed a bradycardic heart rate. There was tenderness on palpation of the left infrascapular area. A prostate examination revealed a nontender hemorrhoid. There was no rash or lymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal.\nBlood levels of calcium, total protein, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Electrocardiograms were notable for sinus rhythm with first-degree and second-degree (2:1) atrioventricular block with intermittent right bundle-branch block (Figure 1A), alternating with sinus rhythm with third-degree (complete) atrioventricular block and junctional escape rhythm with intraventricular conduction delay (Figure 1B). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was negative for pulmonary embolism.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Cardiac Imaging Studies.\nIntravenous ceftriaxone, naproxen, acetaminophen, and oxycodone were administered. The patient was evaluated by an electrophysiologist and admitted to the cardiology unit of this hospital. The next day, the heart rate remained at approximately 40 beats per minute, and the maximum temperature was 37.8\u00b0C. Oxycodone and topical lidocaine were administered.\nDr. Alex L. Huang: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal biventricular systolic function, with no regional left ventricular wall-motion abnormalities. There was mild diastolic mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (Figure 1C), a finding consistent with atrioventricular block.1 There was no evidence of valvular vegetations.\nDr. Khurshid: The blood level of high-sensitivity troponin was 63 ng per liter. Urinalysis was negative, as were blood tests for Lyme disease antibodies, anti-rickettsia IgM, ehrlichia and anaplasma DNA, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, and babesia.\nOn the third hospital day, tests for SARS-CoV-2, Bartonella henselae and B. quintana antibodies, and anti-treponemal antibodies were negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive.\nDr. Borek Foldyna: The patient underwent cardiac CT with electrocardiographic gating, including contrast-enhanced CT angiography and delayed imaging. Epicardial fat and a thickened interatrial septum abutting the noncoronary sinus of the aortic valve showed increased radiodensity on delayed imaging (Figure 2A and 2B); these findings are suggestive of inflammatory changes and may indicate evolving abscess. The tricuspid aortic valve had mildly thickened leaflets, but there was no evidence of focal valvular vegetations, thrombi, or calcifications.\nFIGURE 2\n\nAdvanced Cardiac Imaging Studies.\nDr. Khurshid: Oral doxycycline was administered. On the fourth hospital day, the ventricular rate measured between 30 and 40 beats per minute, and the maximum temperature was 37.9\u00b0C.",

    "user_input": "Dr. Cory A. Perugino: A 70-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of a recurrent left pleural effusion.\nFive years before this presentation, the patient had pain in the shoulders and proximal muscles of the arms and legs. The pain was worse in the morning and was associated with fatigue. There was no associated stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level were elevated. Prednisone was initiated for the treatment of a working diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica, and symptoms abated quickly. During the next year, attempts to discontinue prednisone led to recurrent myalgias, as well as elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level.\nThree years before this presentation, swelling, erythema, and pain developed in the cartilaginous portion of the left ear, sparing the earlobe (Figure 1). There was no reduction in these symptoms after empirical antibacterial therapy was initiated for the treatment of presumed cellulitis. The dose of prednisone was increased, and the symptoms involving the ear resolved; however, they recurred when the dose of prednisone was tapered. Biopsy of the left auricle revealed perichondrial inflammation and degenerative changes in the cartilage. The dose of prednisone was increased for a presumed diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis. The symptoms involving the ear resolved, and weekly therapy with methotrexate was initiated.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs.\nDuring the next 6 months, attempts to taper the prednisone dose were associated with worsening inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms, along with elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was as high as 89 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13) and the C-reactive protein level as high as 73.6 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0).\nTwo years before this presentation, the patient began treatment with tocilizumab for fatigue, markedly elevated C-reactive protein level, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, all of which persisted despite treatment with prednisone and methotrexate. The administration of tocilizumab allowed for the tapering of prednisone to a lower dose without causing an exacerbation of inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms. Two weeks after the patient began receiving tocilizumab therapy, and upon tapering of the prednisone dose, pain and swelling developed in the right leg; ultrasound examination revealed a distal deep-vein thrombosis in the right posterior tibial vein. Repeat ultrasonography of the leg performed 2 weeks later did not show propagation of the deep-vein thrombosis, and the pain and swelling resolved with the continued use of a compression stocking and elevation of the right leg. However, 2 months later, when further tapering of the prednisone dose was started, inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms recurred, and pain and swelling developed in the left leg. Ultrasound examination revealed deep-vein thromboses in the left popliteal and left calf veins and in the right femoral vein; therapy with rivaroxaban was initiated. The development of recurrent deep-vein thromboses was attributed to the underlying inflammatory disease. The dose of prednisone was increased, methotrexate was continued, and tocilizumab was replaced with infliximab therapy.\nDuring the next 6 months, the inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms worsened when attempts were made to taper the prednisone dose, and these conditions abated only when the dose of prednisone was increased. Blood tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), rheumatoid factor, and anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Fifteen months before this presentation, treatment with rituximab was initiated. However, after an attempt to taper the dose of prednisone, bilateral scleritis developed (Figure 1); the dose of prednisone was increased again, which resulted in resolution of the ocular pain and redness. During the next 3 months, attempts to taper the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent episodes of scleritis and inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms; additional rituximab treatment was not administered.\nOne year before the current presentation, treatment with low-dose cyclophosphamide was initiated, but the use of this medication was complicated by severe neutropenia, which did not allow for the dose to be escalated. Nine months before this presentation, treatment with cyclophosphamide was stopped, and intravenous tocilizumab was restarted, given its previous efficacy in this patient. However, the use of tocilizumab also resulted in moderate but transient neutropenia after each infusion.\nSeven months before this presentation, pleuritic chest pain on the lower left side developed, along with dyspnea on exertion and a dry cough. Chest radiography revealed a moderate left pleural effusion (Figure 2A and 2B). Thoracentesis was performed, and 1 liter of straw-colored pleural fluid was removed; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Gram\u2019s staining of the pleural fluid revealed abundant polymorphonuclear cells but no organisms; bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures were without growth. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid revealed no malignant cells. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (performed after the pleural fluid was drained) showed a small left pleural effusion, a trace right pleural effusion, and bibasilar dependent atelectasis without consolidation, nodules, or lymphadenopathy (Figure 2C). The pleural effusions were attributed to ongoing inflammatory disease. The dose of prednisone was increased, and the pleurisy and dyspnea resolved. Five months before this presentation, tocilizumab therapy was stopped, and tofacitinib was initiated. One week before this presentation, the patient had sudden onset of back pain on the left side. Imaging studies were performed.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies of the Chest.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), 7 Mo before Presentation, On Presentation\n\nBlood\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.7\u201317.5, 12.4, 11.1\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 37.1, 33.7\nMean corpuscular volume (fl), 80\u2013100, 108.5, 112.7\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 5700, 3030\nDifferential count (%):\nNeutrophils, 40\u201370, 80.4, 49.6\nLymphocytes, 22\u201344, 7.7, 32.3\nMonocytes, 4\u201311, 6.5, 12.5\nEosinophils, 0\u20138, 1.2, 2\nBasophils, 0\u20133, 0.7, 1\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 165,000, 246,000\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201313, 55, 107\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), <8, 88.7, 205.8\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/liter), 110\u2013210, 192, \u2014\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.0\u20138.3, 7.2, 7.4\n\nPleural fluid\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/liter), \u2014, 195, \u2014\nTotal protein (g/dl), \u2014, 4.8, \u2014\nAlbumin (g/dl), \u2014, 3.3, \u2014\nGlucose (mg/dl), \u2014, 111, \u2014\nRed-cell count (per \u00b5l), \u2014, 55,000, \u2014\nTotal nucleated cells (per \u00b5l), \u2014, 2742, \u2014\nDifferential count (%):\nNeutrophils, 0, 30, \u2014\nLymphocytes, 0, 51, \u2014\nMacrophages, 0, 11, \u2014\nMonocytes, 0, 2, \u2014\nEosinophils, 0, 3, \u2014\nBasophils, 0, 1, \u2014\nUnclassified cells, 0, 2, \u2014\n\nDr. Vincent V. Dinculescu: CT of the chest and abdomen, performed 6 months after the first CT of the chest, revealed a small left pleural effusion that was larger than it had been on the first chest CT (Figure 2D). A punctate stone in the lower pole of the left kidney was also observed, with no evidence of hydronephrosis.\nDr. Perugino: The patient presented to the rheumatology clinic for further evaluation. He had no dyspnea, cough, or fever. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, the blood pressure 145/75 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.2. There was no scleral redness or erythema of the helix of the ear. The heart sounds were regular. Breath sounds were decreased at the base of the left lung. There was no leg edema, joint swelling or tenderness, purpura, petechiae, or deficits in motor strength.\nThe patient had a history of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cecum, which had been diagnosed 10 years before this presentation and had been treated with laparoscopic colectomy of the right side of the colon and with oxaliplatin therapy, without evidence of recurrence. Other history included peripheral neuropathy (attributed to the oxaliplatin therapy), hypothyroidism, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Macrocytic anemia had been present for 3 years before this presentation, with normal blood levels of cobalamin and folate. The patient also had a history of leukopenia and neutropenia; these conditions had occurred intermittently over the course of the 10 years preceding this presentation but were most pronounced after treatment with cyclophosphamide and tocilizumab. Medications included alendronate, atorvastatin, cholecalciferol, folic acid, levothyroxine, methotrexate, omeprazole, prednisone, rivaroxaban, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, and tofacitinib. The patient drank alcohol occasionally; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He lived in New England and was retired. There was no family history of autoimmune disease.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nA diagnostic test was performed, and management decisions were made.",
