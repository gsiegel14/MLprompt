[{"user_input": "Dr. Matthew L. Meizlish (Medicine): A 57-year-old woman with resected stage IIIC cutaneous melanoma was admitted to this hospital because of fever.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 months before the current admission, when bleeding developed from a lesion on the right side of the scalp. After evaluation by her primary care physician, she was referred to a surgical clinic at another hospital; examination of a skin-biopsy specimen revealed ulcerated melanoma with positive margins. The patient was referred to the oncology clinic of this hospital.\nThree months before the current admission, a wide local excision of the scalp lesion and a neck lymph-node dissection were performed; examination of the specimens revealed metastatic melanoma in 2 of 26 lymph nodes. A diagnosis of stage IIIC melanoma was made. Molecular profiling identified the BRAF V600E mutation, and treatment with adjuvant therapy was planned to begin after the patient had recovered fully from surgery.\nOne month before the current admission, the patient was evaluated in the oncology clinic for initiation of treatment with a combination of dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (a MEK inhibitor) as targeted therapy for melanoma. She felt well, and the surgical wound had healed. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was started.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), 1 Mo before This Admission, (Oncology Clinic, This Hospital), On Admission (This Hospital), Hospital Day 5 (This Hospital)\n\nBlood:\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 3810, 5190, 3430\n\nDifferential count (per ul):\nNeutrophils (per \u00b5l), 1800\u20137700, 1810, 4560, 2720\nLymphocytes (per \u00b5l), 1000\u20134800, 1490, 90, 460\nMonocytes (per \u00b5l), 200\u20131200, 450, \u2014, 150\nEosinophils (per \u00b5l), 0\u2013900, 20, \u2014, 60\nBasophils (per \u00b5l), 0\u2013300, 30, \u2014, \u2014\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.0\u201316.0, 13.0, 12.9, 9.4\nHematocrit (%), 37.0\u201349.0, 40.6, 38.9, 27.2\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 207,000, 87,000, 99,000\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, \u2014, 16.7, 14.3\nProthrombin-time international normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, \u2014, 1.4, 1.1\nActivated partial-thromboplastin time (sec), 22.0\u201336.0, \u2014, 47.9, 27.2\nD-dimer (ng/ml), 0\u2013500, \u2014, >10,000, 3457\nFibrinogen (mg/dl), 150\u2013400, \u2014, 135, 153\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 138, 131, 138\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20134.5, 4.2, 3.8, 3.3\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 109, 97, 107\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 22, 19, 22\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 19, 42, 13\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.86, 2.73, 1.07\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 99, 118, 99\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 4.3, 3.6, 2.3\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.0\u20138.3, 6.6, 6.6, 4.9\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201332, 30, 190, 407\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201333, 19, 62, 138\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 30\u2013100, 76, 173, 510\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 0.2, 1.9, 2.6\nLipase (U/liter), 13\u201360, \u2014, 42, \u2014\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/liter), 110\u2013210, \u2014, 285, 658\nLactic acid (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.0, \u2014, 1.0, 0.8\nCreatine kinase (U/liter), 40\u2013150, \u2014, 1679, \u2014\n\nUrine:\nColor, Yellow, \u2014, Yellow,\u2014\nClarity, Clear, \u2014, Turbid, \u2014\npH, 6.0, \u2014, 5.5, \u2014\nSpecific gravity, 1.012, \u2014, 1.013, \u2014\nGlucose, Negative, \u2014, Negative, \u2014\nKetones, Negative, \u2014, Negative, \u2014\nLeukocyte esterase, Negative, \u2014, Negative, \u2014\nNitrite, Negative, \u2014, Negative, \u2014\nBlood, Negative, \u2014, 2+, \u2014\nProtein, Negative, \u2014, 1+, \u2014\nRed cells (per high-power field), \u2014, \u2014, 0\u20132, \u2014\nWhite cells (per high-power field), \u2014, \u2014, 0\u201310, \u2014\n\nOne day after the initiation of treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib, fever and nausea developed. Dabrafenib and trametinib therapy was temporarily discontinued, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was started. Fever and nausea resolved after 1 day, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was stopped. Once the patient had 1 day without recurrent fever after the antipyretic medications had been stopped, treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was resumed.\nTwo weeks before the current admission, fever recurred. The patient was evaluated at the other hospital. The blood levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of kidney function. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again stopped, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was started. Fever and nausea resolved after 1 day, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was stopped. Once the patient had 1 day without recurrent fever after the antipyretic medications had been stopped, treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again resumed.\nFour days before the current admission, fever recurred. The patient was again evaluated at the other hospital. Results of liver tests and kidney-function tests were again normal, as was the complete blood count. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again stopped, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was initiated. Daily fevers persisted for 4 days, and the patient was advised to present to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported fatigue that had started 1 month earlier and had gradually increased in severity, as well as light-headedness when standing from a seated position. She also reported intermittent vomiting, loose stools, and pain in the right upper quadrant that increased after eating but no diarrhea or dysuria. She had a dry cough without shortness of breath.\nOther medical history included carpal tunnel syndrome that had been treated with carpal tunnel release surgery. The patient had no known drug allergies. She worked as a nurse and lived with her husband and two adult children in a coastal region of New England. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit drugs. Her father had hyperthyroidism; her mother had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease.\nThe temporal temperature was 40.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 85/53 mm Hg, the pulse 108 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was diaphoretic and appeared ill. The mucous membranes were moist, and no lesions were present in the oropharynx. The heart sounds were regular, with no murmurs, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. There was mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No rash was present.\nThe white-cell count was 5190 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); 20% of the cells were bands (reference range, 0 to 10), and 10% were metamyelocytes (reference value, 0). The platelet count was 87,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The blood level of creatinine was 2.73 mg per deciliter (241 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), AST 190 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32), ALT 62 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and alkaline phosphatase 173 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). Tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for adenovirus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were negative. A blood specimen was obtained for culture. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Jiyoon Kang: Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant (Figure 1A and 1B) revealed cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis or biliary ductal dilatation. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1C through 1F), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed findings suggestive of hepatic steatosis, pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions, subsegmental linear atelectasis, and bilateral lung nodules that were similar in appearance to those seen on staging CT performed 1 month earlier.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Abdomen, Pelvis, and Chest.\nDr. Meizlish: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the blood pressure improved; empirical treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and azithromycin was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nOn hospital day 2, fever and nausea resolved. There was no vomiting or loose stools. However, pain in the right upper quadrant had worsened. On hospital day 3, blood cultures were without growth, and treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and azithromycin was discontinued. The patient remained afebrile. On hospital day 5, the blood level of AST was 407 U per liter, ALT 138 U per liter, and alkaline phosphatase 510 U per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nA diagnostic test was performed.", "ground_truth_output": "BRAF\u2013MEK inhibitor\u2013related toxic effects."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Kathy M. Tran (Medicine): A 21-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of fatigue, weight gain, and abdominal pain.\nThe patient had been well until 4 months before the current evaluation, when an episode of dull, aching pain in the right lower quadrant occurred. The pain lasted for a few hours before resolving spontaneously. During the next 4 months, episodes of abdominal pain continued to occur and increased in duration, frequency, and severity. The patient sought evaluation in the gynecology clinic of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient described the pain as variable, rating it between 3 and 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The episodes of pain occurred daily and lasted for up to 20 hours. The pain decreased with sitting or lying down and did not increase with movement; it was not associated with her menstrual period. The patient also reported fatigue, irritability, and weight gain of 4.5 kg in the previous 4 months despite increased exercise and decreased food intake.\nThere was a history of hypothyroidism, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and migraines. The patient had never been pregnant and had no known history of sexually transmitted infections or abnormal results on screening tests for cervical cancer. She had previously been sexually active with male partners, but she reported no current sexual activity. She had taken oral contraceptives for 2 years but had stopped taking them 6 months before this evaluation, when a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) was placed. Other medications included levothyroxine, citalopram, and multivitamins; there were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived with roommates in an urban area of New England. She was a former athlete and worked as a research scientist. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her mother, coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia in her father, breast cancer and diabetes in her paternal grandmother, and lung cancer in her paternal grandfather.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 119/73 mm Hg and the heart rate 62 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The thyroid was firm on palpation, with a small nodule noted on the right side. The abdomen was nondistended, soft, and nontender. A small hernia with a thrill was noted at the right inguinal ring. A speculum examination of the vagina and cervix was normal; IUD strings were visible at the cervical os. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes and glucose and results of tests for kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis were negative. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Madeleine Sertic: Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass (measuring 4.8 cm by 5.0 cm by 3.9 cm) along the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe (Figure 1A). The uterus, ovaries, and adnexa were normal. There was no free fluid in the pelvis, and the IUD was in an appropriate position.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a right adrenal mass (measuring 4.5 cm by 4.7 cm by 4.0 cm) that was T2 isointense (Figure 1B) and T1 hypointense. The mass had diffusion restriction (Figure 1C), as well as early enhancement with washout, which refers to the temporal reduction in the enhancement of a lesion. The features were indeterminate and were not definitively diagnostic of adrenal adenoma or another adrenal lesion, such as pheochromocytoma or adrenocortical carcinoma.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis again revealed a right adrenal mass, which had a density of 33 Hounsfield units (HU) before the administration of contrast material (Figure 1D), 74 HU during the portal-venous phase (Figure 1E), and 45 HU during the 15-minute delayed phase (Figure 1F). The absolute washout was calculated as 71%. The absolute washout is calculated by dividing the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the delayed-phase density by the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the unenhanced density and then converting the result to a percentage: [(HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU delayed phase) / (HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU unenhanced)] \u00d7 100. Adrenal adenomas tend to wash out faster than other adrenal lesions, and an absolute washout of more than 60% is highly suggestive of an adrenal adenoma. However, lesions larger than 4 cm are likely to be malignant, regardless of the washout characteristics.1 There was also a thin-walled cyst (measuring 3.3 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the left lung.\nDr. Tran: The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Additional laboratory tests were performed to further evaluate the adrenal mass. Blood levels of renin and aldosterone were normal, as were urinary levels of catecholamines and metanephrines. An overnight, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed. The baseline blood corticotropin level was 3 pg per milliliter (0.7 pmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 76 pg per milliliter [1.3 to 16.7 pmol per liter]). At 11 p.m., dexamethasone (1 mg) was administered; at 8 a.m., the blood cortisol level was 9.1 \u03bcg per deciliter (251 nmol per liter; reference value, <1.8 \u03bcg per deciliter [50 nmol per liter]), and the concurrent blood dexamethasone level was 631 ng per deciliter (reference range, 140 to 295). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 31.0 \u03bcg (reference range, 3.5 to 45.0); the blood levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were normal.\nManagement decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Adrenocortical carcinoma."}, {"user_input": "Dr. James Q. Zhou (Medicine): A 56-year-old woman with metabolic dysfunction\u2013associated steatohepatitis and cirrhosis was admitted to this hospital because of end-stage liver disease.\nThe patient had been chronically ill and was healing from recent left hip surgery when new fatigue and abdominal pain developed 15 days before this admission. The patient did not take her routine, prescribed medications because of confusion. Thirteen days before this admission, when confusion prevented the patient from going to a scheduled appointment for therapeutic paracentesis, her husband took her to the emergency department of another hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported abdominal pain and otherwise answered questions unreliably with one-word responses. She appeared jaundiced and was confused but oriented. Marked abdominal distention with bulging flanks and diffuse tenderness was observed. The left hip was bruised with a healing surgical wound with staples in place. Urinalysis was normal, and a urine toxicology screening was positive for opioids, oxycodone, and fentanyl, which had been prescribed.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a shrunken nodular cirrhotic liver contour and large-volume ascites; the gallbladder was surgically absent. Compression deformities of the lumbar spine, healed pubic rami fractures, and a left hip prosthesis were also noted. CT of the head revealed mild scattered hypodensities in the white matter, a finding consistent with chronic small-vessel disease.\nDr. Zhou: Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone was administered. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nDuring the subsequent 12 days, lactulose and rifaximin were administered, and hepatic encephalopathy abated. Anemia worsened, and packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which reportedly revealed esophageal varices with evidence of previous band ligation and no active bleeding, as well as portal hypertensive gastropathy and erythematous duodenitis. Results of testing of the peritoneal fluid were not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ceftriaxone was stopped. Treatment with furosemide and spironolactone was administered, and three therapeutic paracenteses were performed. The renal function worsened, the administration of diuretic agents was stopped, albumin was given intravenously, and treatment with midodrine and octreotide was started. On hospital day 13, the patient was transferred to this hospital for additional management of end-stage liver disease and acute renal injury, as well as evaluation for liver transplantation.\nOn transfer to this hospital, the patient described nausea and increasing abdominal distention and discomfort. A review of systems was notable for headache, heartburn, and pain in the left shoulder and hip.\nThe patient had a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, anxiety, and depression. Migraines had occurred frequently in the past but had been rare after menopause. She had previously undergone a cesarean section, cholecystectomy, arthroplasty of the left shoulder, and recently, an open reduction and internal fixation involving the left femur. Medications included lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, ondansetron, pantoprazole, simethicone, insulin, gabapentin, duloxetine, and levothyroxine. Oxycodone and fentanyl patches started after the recent surgery were weaned and stopped, and the patient took acetaminophen as needed for pain. Treatment with azithromycin, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, and hydromorphone had caused nausea and diarrhea; metoclopramide, promethazine, and prochlorperazine had caused anxiety. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her husband and did not work because of medical disability. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit drugs.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 92/55 mm Hg, and the pulse 78 beats per minute. The patient appeared chronically ill and jaundiced and was alert and oriented. The abdomen was tensely distended, with a fluid wave and diffuse tenderness. She had no asterixis, and trace swelling was present in both legs. No rash was present. The neurologic examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with midodrine and octreotide was stopped, and treatment with terlipressin was started.\nOn hospital day 2, the patient noted that headache, which had been present since admission to the other hospital, had increased in severity. The pain, which she described as \u201cthrobbing and pounding,\u201d was in the right frontal region and reminded her of previous migraines.\nOn hospital day 3, headache persisted, and the pain radiated to the back of her neck, which was not typical of her previous migraines. Butalbital\u2013acetaminophen\u2013caffeine was given, and a lidocaine patch was placed at the back of the neck; however, the pain did not abate after these treatments. On hospital day 4, nausea and abdominal distention increased, and therapeutic paracentesis was performed.\nDr. Kozak: CT of the head showed no changes from the previous imaging (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\n\nInitial CT of the Head.\nDr. Zhou: The administration of sumatriptan and intravenous magnesium and hydromorphone relieved the headache. However, on hospital day 5, headache worsened in severity throughout the day until the patient was tearful and rated the pain at 9 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She had new photophobia, and blurred vision developed in the right eye. Intravenous hydromorphone was administered, and she subsequently rated the pain at 6 out of 10.\nA diagnosis was made.", "ground_truth_output": "Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Carolina Chiou (Ophthalmology): A 78-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a rash on the forehead and frontal scalp and edema of the left eyelids.\nThe patient had been well until 3 days before presentation, when pressurelike pain developed in the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp and the bilateral maxillary sinuses and upper jaws. He described the pain as similar to previous episodes of sinusitis. He was evaluated in the primary care clinic of another hospital, and treatment with oral clindamycin was started for a presumed diagnosis of sinusitis.\nTwo days before presentation, the patient noted erythema and small reddish-brown skin lesions on the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp. His barber had pointed out a similar spot on the top of his scalp 2 weeks earlier. The skin lesions were not painful or itchy, and he did not seek medical evaluation.\nOn the day of presentation, the patient awoke from sleep and noted redness and swelling of the left eyelids. The skin lesions on the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp had increased in number, and some were covered with hemorrhagic crust. There was pain with movement of the left eye and blurry vision. Over the course of several hours, the swelling of the left eyelids worsened and the patient was unable to fully open the left eye. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported no ocular or nasal discharge, no changes in taste or hearing, and no jaw claudication. He had not recently changed his shampoo or been in a pool or hot tub. He had a history of recurrent sinus infection, allergic rhinitis, depression, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypogonadism, and restless legs syndrome. He had received a diagnosis of rectal cancer 15 years earlier, which had led to partial colectomy, as well as a diagnosis of testicular cancer 50 years earlier, which had led to orchiectomy and radiation therapy. His ocular history included bilateral mild ptosis; he had undergone bilateral cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation. Medications included finasteride, tamsulosin, carbidopa\u2013levodopa, nasal azelastine and fluticasone, and topical testosterone. Levofloxacin, cefaclor, and sulfamethoxazole\u2013trimethoprim had caused a rash. The patient was a retired engineer and lived with his wife in a coastal community of New England. He had previously smoked a pipe but had quit 30 years earlier. He drank a quarter glass of wine daily. His family history included skin cancer in his maternal grandmother and macular degeneration in his sister.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 122/58 mm Hg, and the heart rate 74 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 31.9. Visual acuity without glasses was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye. Results of Ishihara color testing were normal. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were full. There was complete ptosis of the left upper eyelid, along with erythema and edema of left upper and lower lids. There was mild ptosis of the right upper lid. There was no proptosis. The intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed diffuse conjunctival injection and inferior chemosis in the left eye. The corneas were clear, and no cells were visualized in the anterior chambers. Results of dilated fundoscopic examination were normal. There was prominent erythema affecting the forehead, left side of the anterior scalp, and left eyelids. Multiple coalescing erosions covered with hemorrhagic and serous crust were seen at sites of erythema, mainly affecting the left side of the forehead and extending to the midline, the frontal scalp, and the left upper eyelid. Erosions and erythema affected the right side of the forehead, as well, but to a much lesser extent. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nLaboratory evaluation revealed a blood sodium level of 125 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145).

Kelly: Computed tomography (CT) of the head and face (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed marked swelling affecting the soft tissue over the left orbit and frontal sinus and extending superiorly along the superficial soft tissue of the frontal scalp, predominantly on the left side. The globe, orbit, and retrobulbar soft tissue were normal. The right maxillary sinus showed nearly complete opacification with wall thickening and sclerosis, findings consistent with chronic inflammation and sinusitis. There was a defect in the medial wall of the right maxillary sinus that was consistent with previous sinus surgery. The other paranasal sinuses, including the left maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinuses, and sphenoid sinuses, were well aerated.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Head and Face.\nDr. Chiou: Empirical treatment with valacyclovir, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, and topical bacitracin\u2013polymyxin B was started. The next day, the edema and erythema of the left eyelids worsened, and there was new edema and erythema of the right eyelids. The patient was unable to open his eyes. He began to have visual hallucinations, and his wife noted that he was confused. The skin lesions on the left side of the forehead were unchanged, and new round punched-out erosions with overlying hemorrhagic crust were present on the right side of the forehead (Figure 2). Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and acyclovir was started.\nFIGURE 2\n\nClinical Photographs.\nA diagnostic test was performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Varicella\u2013zoster virus infection."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Viral S. Shah: A 26-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of respiratory failure and altered mental status.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current admission, when she underwent elective abdominoplasty and liposuction at an ambulatory surgery center. During the procedure, anesthetic agents included intravenous propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, and ketamine, as well as local lidocaine injections. During recovery after the procedure, medications included intravenous cefazolin, enoxaparin, and ondansetron; oral oxycodone, tramadol, and gabapentin; and transdermal scopolamine. The patient was lethargic after the procedure but was able to be discharged home after a period of observation.\nLater that day, the patient was instructed by telephone to take a lower dose of postoperative oxycodone. The next day, on evaluation at the surgical center, she was found to be somnolent but arousable and able to answer questions with effort; the scopolamine patch was removed. Several hours after the patient returned home, her family noticed that she had increased respiratory effort and minimal responsiveness. She was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of a local hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/77 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 83% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was lethargic, moaned intermittently, and responded with one-word answers; symmetric movement in the arms and legs was observed. Intravenous naloxone was administered, with minor improvement in her condition. Levels of electrolytes and results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Mendoza: A chest radiograph showed diffuse confluent opacities in both lungs (Figure 1A). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary-embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed diffuse mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving all lobes of the lungs, with relative sparing of the subpleural lung (Figure 1B). CT of the abdomen revealed postoperative changes. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild effacement of the cerebral sulci and cisterns on both sides, a finding suggestive of mild diffuse cerebral edema (Figure 1C and 1D). There was also a small hypodensity in the left globus pallidus, a finding suggestive of infarction.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies.\nDr. Shah: Noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the other hospital. Intravenous vancomycin, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir were administered empirically, and a triple-lumen central venous catheter was inserted.\nThe next morning, the findings on a repeat chest radiograph appeared to be unchanged, but the patient had progressive lethargy, so intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Pink frothy secretions were noted. Intravenous methylprednisolone, propofol, and norepinephrine were administered. A nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. The troponin I level increased to 4.31 ng per milliliter (reference range, <0.029). The thyrotropin, carboxyhemoglobin, and lipase levels were normal, and tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigens were negative.\nLater that afternoon, the patient was transferred to the ICU at this hospital. A review of systems was unavailable because intubation was performed on arrival. Medical history that was obtained from family members included iron-deficiency anemia, anxiety disorder, insomnia, and two normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Regular medications included lorazepam as needed for sleep; postoperative medications included tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone as needed for pain. There were no known adverse reactions to medication. The patient had attended college and worked in an office. She lived with her husband and children. She drank alcohol intermittently and did not use tobacco or other substances. There was no family history of cardiopulmonary or neurologic disorders.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg while the patient was receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 8 \u03bcg per minute. The height was 168 cm and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.8. The oxygen saturation was 99% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in volume-control mode (tidal volume, 320 ml; positive end-expiratory pressure, 12 cm of water; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0). The pupils were 2 mm and symmetrically reactive. The lung sounds were coarse. The abdominal incision was well approximated and without drainage; abdominal drains were in place on both sides. A neurologic examination with interruption of sedation showed spontaneous eye-opening but an inability to visually track and to follow commands. Brain-stem reflexes were intact. The legs withdrew equally and briskly in response to pain. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nA chest radiograph showed diffuse opacities in both lungs. Levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, creatine kinase, lipase, and ammonia were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Urine toxicologic screening was negative except for the presence of opiates. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram including posterior leads showed sinus rhythm, rightward axis deviation, diminutive Q waves, and minor nonspecific ST\u2013T-wave abnormalities. An abdominal radiograph showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern, subcutaneous emphysema, and surgical drains over the pelvis. On bedside cardiac ultrasonography, the left ventricle could not be visualized clearly, but right ventricular dilatation did not appear to be present. Intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered.\nDr. Mendoza: CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed hypodensities in the left basal ganglia and right cerebellum that were suggestive of infarcts; the previously described cerebral edema had reduced slightly. A CT angiogram of the head and neck was normal. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a reduction in ground-glass opacities but an increase in consolidations, particularly in the lower lobes. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a small anterior abdominal hematoma and diffuse subcutaneous emphysema.\nDr. Shah: A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. On hospital day 2, the findings on neurologic examination worsened, with only sluggish eye-opening and no motor responses to noxious stimuli. Intravenous mannitol at a dose of 1 g per kilogram of body weight was administered.\nDr. Mendoza: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a hypodensity in the left globus pallidus that had not changed from the previous study, as well as a hypodensity in the right cerebellum that was not definitive and was probably an artifact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed infarcts within the globi pallidi and smaller punctate infarcts in the cerebral white matter. There were also innumerable diffuse microhemorrhagic foci affecting the cerebral white matter, including the corpus callosum (Figure 2).\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Shah: Bronchoscopy revealed bloody mucus in the distal trachea (Figure 3). Serial bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed in the right upper lobe revealed increasingly erythematous effluent.\nFIGURE 3\n\nImages Obtained on Bronchoscopy.\nLupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were not detected. Levels of C3 and C4 were normal. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Tests for legionella, streptococcus, and galactomannan urinary antigens and antitreponemal antibodies were negative, as was a repeat nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2.\nDr. Yasmin Aghajan: On hospital day 3, the patient underwent continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. The study was abnormal because of generalized rhythmic delta activity at a frequency of 1 Hz, which occasionally evolved to generalized periodic discharges superimposed on a disorganized background with irregular delta and theta slowing. There were no epileptiform abnormalities. Although generalized rhythmic delta activity and generalized periodic discharges are on the ictal\u2013interictal continuum, there were no features suggestive of seizures. The electroencephalographic findings were consistent with encephalopathy and the effects of propofol.\nA diagnosis was made.", "ground_truth_output": "Fat embolism syndrome."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Ya Haddy Sallah (Medicine): A 29-year-old man with sickle cell disease was admitted to this hospital because of pain in the right hip.\nThe patient had received a diagnosis of sickle cell disease in childhood.

Frontal and lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine (Figure 1B) showed superior and inferior end-plate depressions at multiple vertebral levels and diffuse bony sclerosis, findings consistent with bony changes from sickle cell disease. An anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis (Figure 1C) showed evidence of total hip arthroplasty; the findings had not changed from those observed on recently obtained radiographs.\nFIGURE 1\n\nRadiographs of the Chest, Spine, and Pelvis Obtained 7 Days before the Current Admission.\nDr. Sallah: A diagnosis of a painful vaso-occlusive event was made, and treatment included intravenous fluids, ketorolac, and hydromorphone. Musculoskeletal strain was considered to be a contributing factor for the pain, given the recent strenuous activity. The pain slowly abated, and on hospital day 5, the patient was discharged home.\nOne day after discharge, and 2 days before the current presentation, pain in the right hip developed while the patient was at rest. Despite treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen, the hip pain worsened, and the patient was unable to walk. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported pain in the right hip that felt different in quality from the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. He also reported pleuritic chest pain that felt similar in quality to the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. The tympanic temperature measured at home was 37.8\u00b0C.\nDuring the 6 months before the current presentation, vaso-occlusive events had increased in frequency and severity. There had been three hospital admissions with a duration of 4 to 8 days, including one admission for acute chest syndrome. The pain associated with vaso-occlusive events typically involved the chest, arms, or thighs. There was a history of automated red-cell exchange, which had been performed before total hip arthroplasty; there was also a history of four blood transfusions. Other history included tinnitus, symmetric high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, and cholelithiasis. Medications included voxelotor and folic acid, as well as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and hydromorphone as needed for pain. The patient had no known allergies. He lived in a suburb of Boston and worked as an engineer. He had traveled to West Africa 1 year before the current presentation and to South Asia 3 weeks before the current presentation. He drank alcohol occasionally, had never smoked tobacco, and did not use illicit drugs. Both of his parents and his brother had sickle cell trait.\nThe temporal temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 121/56 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. He had mild tenderness on palpation of the right hip but no obvious deformity; there was a well-healed incision without overlying erythema. He was able to fully extend and flex the right hip, but such movement caused mild discomfort. There was moderate discomfort with the log-roll test (rolling the thigh internally and externally with the patient in the supine position). The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 15,680 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the hemoglobin level 7.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the platelet count 581,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The blood C-reactive protein level was 100.6 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 113 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 14). Nucleic acid amplification testing for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative.

McFadden (Medicine): A 22-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital in the summer before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic because of headache, fever, and respiratory failure.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 8 days before the current presentation, when nausea and myalgias developed. Over the next 2 days, chills, vomiting, neck pain, and headache with sonophobia developed. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital, where an evaluation reportedly showed dry mucous membranes but no signs of meningitis. The white-cell count was 12,300 per microliter (reference range, 4800 to 10,800), and the platelet count was 95,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Intravenous normal saline and morphine were administered, and the patient was discharged with supportive care for a presumed viral syndrome.\nDuring the next week, the patient had worsening headache and new photophobia, as well as malaise, anorexia, nonproductive cough, and dyspnea with minimal exertion. Two days before the current presentation, the patient\u2019s mother noticed episodes of confusion with nonsensical speech and excessive sleepiness, and she took the patient back to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported ongoing severe headaches and dyspnea. The temporal temperature was 38.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient had photophobia, but the neurologic examination was reportedly otherwise normal. She had mild throat erythema and diffuse abdominal tenderness with intermittent guarding. A urine test for beta human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained.\nTable 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed subarachnoid hemorrhage and diffuse ischemic changes in the parietal and temporal lobes. Lumbar puncture was deferred because of thrombocytopenia. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed diffuse interstitial lung markings, multiple opacities and nodules in the peripheral lung, two hypodensities in the peripheral spleen, and subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and doxycycline was administered. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital.\nThe next morning, screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus were negative, as was a blood-smear examination for parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Platelets were transfused, and intravenous normal saline was administered. The respiratory rate increased to 45 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 93% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 8 liters per minute; ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure was attempted, and intravenous furosemide was administered. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole were discontinued, and empirical treatment with intravenous meropenem and clindamycin was administered. The patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital.\nOn arrival at this hospital, the patient had confusion and tachypnea and thus provided a limited history, but family members provided additional information. The patient had a history of depression, for which she received citalopram. She had no known drug allergies. She worked in health care. She drank wine socially, used electronic cigarettes, and occasionally smoked marijuana but did not smoke tobacco. Her most recent travel had been to the Caribbean more than 1 year before the current presentation. She had no exposure to wooded or rural areas. Her family had dogs, but she had no bites or scratches; she had no other animal or insect exposures. There were no recent sexual contacts. Her mother had cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and her maternal grandmother had Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 103/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 49 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 8 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22. The patient appeared to be in respiratory distress, with accessory muscles used for breathing. She was oriented only after prompting. She had meningismus and concomitant rigidity of the shoulders with passive range of motion, but she had no focal cranial-nerve, strength, or sensory deficits. Auscultation of the lungs and heart revealed diffuse rales and rhonchi, as well as a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur that was loudest at the apex and left axilla and radiated to the sternum. The spleen tip was palpable. A small patch of petechiae was present on the upper chest. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of phosphorus, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; antinuclear antibodies were undetectable. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional blood cultures were obtained. Chest radiography showed diffuse lung opacities and pleural effusions on both sides. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia with normal intervals and nonspecific minor ST- and T-wave changes. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, doxycycline, and acyclovir was administered.\nFour hours after admission, increased work of breathing, tachypnea, and confusion progressed, and the trachea was intubated for initiation of mechanical ventilation. Intravenous propofol, hydromorphone, and phenylephrine were administered. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, revealing mildly bloody and frothy effluent from all the lobes of the lungs. On examination of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, the nucleated-cell count was 375 per microliter, with 77% neutrophils. Gram\u2019s staining showed no organisms. Tests for common respiratory virus \u2014 including influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses \u2014 were negative. A culture was also obtained.\nDr. Eric W. Zhang: CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral scattered curvilinear hyperdensities in the cortical sulci, findings suggestive of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (Figure 1A). There were also focal hypodense regions in the left superior parietal lobule and right temporal lobe with loss of normal gray\u2013white matter differentiation, findings suggestive of acute cortical infarcts (Figure 1B). CT pulmonary angiography showed evidence of mild interstitial edema, bilateral pleural effusions, and multifocal peribronchovascular nodular opacities and consolidations involving all the lobes of the lungs, some of which were peripherally distributed, without cavitation (Figure 1C). CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed several splenic hypodensities, which were most likely splenic infarcts, with accompanying mild ascites and mild periportal edema (Figure 1D).\nFigure 1\n\nCT and MRI Images.\nDr. McFadden: Platelets were transfused, and lumbar puncture was performed, with an opening pressure of 38 cm of water.

The focal hypodense regions in the left superior parietal lobule and right temporal lobe that had been noted previously on CT were associated with restricted diffusion on an apparent-diffusion-coefficient map (Figure 1F) and on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure 1G) from MRI of the head, which is compatible with bilateral acute cortical infarcts.", "ground_truth_output": "Infective endocarditis due to Haemophilus parainfluenzae."}, {"user_input": "Dr. P. Connor Johnson (Medicine): A 39-year-old woman presented to this hospital with fever, flank pain, and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 4 weeks before admission, when she noted tender bilateral inguinal swelling. Two days later, she began to have sharp, intermittent flank pain on the right side; she rated the pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. During the next 3 days, she had nausea and a poor appetite. She noted foul-smelling urine but had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or hematuria.\nThree weeks before admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, and she appeared well. There was costovertebral and abdominal tenderness on the right side, without rebound or guarding. The external genitalia were normal. Copious thin, white vaginal discharge was present; no cervical motion tenderness was noted, and the ovaries were normal on palpation. Multiple bilateral tender inguinal lymph nodes, measuring up to 2 cm in diameter, were noted on palpation. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. On microscopic examination of the vaginal discharge, clue cells were observed, but there were no fungal elements or trichomonads. Nucleic acid amplification tests of a cervical swab for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were negative. A blood test for IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies to C. trachomatis serovars L1 and D through K was negative. Urinalysis revealed leukocyte esterase and nitrates; urine was obtained for culture. Vaginal metronidazole gel was prescribed.\nTwo days later, the urine culture grew more than 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU) of Escherichia coli per milliliter and 10,000 to 100,000 CFU of Klebsiella pneumoniae per milliliter. A 14-day course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was prescribed.\nThe inguinal swelling reportedly abated, but the flank pain and nausea persisted. Two days after the patient completed the prescribed course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, fever and night sweats developed. After 3 days of fever with a temperature of up to 38.5\u00b0C, she began vomiting and subsequently presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing flank pain, malaise, nausea, and poor appetite with weight loss of 2.3 kg during the past month. There was no sore throat, cough, or diarrhea. She had a history of hypothyroidism, asthma, bipolar disorder, dysmenorrhea, and migraines. She had had multiple urinary tract infections; pyelonephritis had been diagnosed 4 years before this presentation. A copper intrauterine device had been inserted 6 months before this presentation. Medications included albuterol, budesonide\u2013formoterol, divalproex, levothyroxine, loratadine, and sumatriptan as needed for migraines. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had immigrated to the United States from Brazil 1 year earlier; she had been living in New England during the past year and had been working in a laboratory. She had recently spent 3 months in Brazil visiting her husband and had returned to New England shortly before she noted inguinal swelling. While in Brazil, she had remained in a large city and had not visited any remote locations. In New England, she lived alone with one kitten and one full-grown cat. There was no family history of cancer. An aunt had died from tuberculosis, but the patient had had only minimal contact with her aunt.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

He was taken to the primary care clinic at another hospital and was told that he had a viral infection.\nNine days before this admission, new mild sore throat developed, and the patient returned to the primary care clinic. A throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was reportedly negative. The patient was told that he had possible sinusitis, and treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was started. During the next 3 days, the sore throat abated, but fatigue and fever persisted.\nSix days before this admission, new pain in the right shoulder and left knee developed, and the patient again returned to the primary care clinic. The white-cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reportedly elevated; a blood test for Lyme disease was performed.\nOn the day of admission, the joint pain progressed to involve the shoulders and knees on both sides, and the temperature increased to 39.4\u00b0C. The patient was given ibuprofen and brought to the emergency department at this hospital. On evaluation, the patient described aching pain in the shoulders and knees, which was worst in his right shoulder and left knee. He rated the pain at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had not noticed redness, swelling, or stiffness of the joints. A review of systems was notable for chills, intermittent night sweats, headache, myalgias, and lightheadedness when he stood up from a sitting position. He had no weight loss, rash, vision changes, or respiratory symptoms. He had mild abdominal cramping, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea. During the past week, there had been a few episodes of nonbloody emesis and watery diarrhea. There had been no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.\nThe patient had autism spectrum disorder, with an early delay in speech development that had resolved after speech therapy. He had met milestones for gross and fine motor skills and growth. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. Other history included asthma, seasonal rhinosinusitis, and allergies to peanuts and tree nuts; there were no known drug allergies. He had undergone a tonsillectomy in early childhood. Medications included amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, inhaled fluticasone, and ibuprofen and inhaled albuterol as needed.\nAt the time of admission, the patient was on his summer break before entering high school. Earlier in the summer, he had gone on vacation to a coastal area of New England. He had also attended camp in a rural area of New England, where he camped and hiked in wooded areas and swam in fresh water. He had seen a tick on his clothing but did not recall any bites. Two weeks before this admission, the patient had returned to his home in a suburban area of New England, where he lived with his mother (who was a veterinarian), father, sister, and pet dog. His sister had recently had an acute gastrointestinal illness that resolved after several days. The patient was not sexually active and did not use alcohol, drugs, or tobacco.

At 34 weeks of gestation, an ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy had reportedly revealed an avascular intraabdominal cystic mass that was located near the bladder and measured 3.7 cm by 2.1 cm by 2.0 cm. A sacral dimple was noted. The patient\u2019s mother was referred to the maternal\u2013fetal medicine clinic of the other hospital; she declined follow-up imaging and amniocentesis.\nAt 37 weeks 6 days of gestation, premature labor occurred, and the patient\u2019s mother was taken to a second hospital. A fetal heart tracing was noted to be nonreactive with minimal variability. The fetal biophysical profile score was 4 out of 8, indicating decreased breathing motion and body movement but normal tone and amniotic fluid volume. An emergency cesarean section was performed.\nOn delivery, the newborn had limp tone and poor respiratory effort. The birth weight was 2963 g (19th percentile), the length 48 cm (20th percentile), and the head circumference 35 cm (77th percentile). The Apgar scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes were 7 and 9, respectively. The patient was transferred to the newborn nursery.\nIn the nursery, the patient was noted to be jittery. Oxygen therapy was administered through a low-flow nasal cannula. The blood glucose level was reportedly less than 10 mg per deciliter (0.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]) and the bilirubin level 16.0 mg per deciliter (274 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 2.0 to 15.0 mg per deciliter [34 to 257 \u03bcmol per liter]). A chest radiograph showed a normal cardiac shadow and findings indicative of retained fetal lung fluid. The newborn was fed, and a bolus of dextrose was administered; however, a repeat blood glucose level was 2 mg per deciliter (0.1 mmol per liter). A continuous infusion of dextrose was started. Phototherapy and empirical treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin were administered.\nDuring the next 3 days, the patient\u2019s blood glucose level remained low, with a maximum level of 61 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter), even though the glucose infusion rate was increased and enteral feeding with formula was initiated. On the fourth day of life, she was transferred to the neonatal ICU of this hospital for further treatment.\nOn admission to the neonatal ICU, additional history was obtained. Before the ultrasonographic survey at 34 weeks of gestation, the pregnancy had been normal. The patient\u2019s mother had taken prenatal vitamins. Prenatal maternal screening had been negative for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, as well as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and group B streptococcal infections; there was evidence of immunity to rubella virus.

During the next 3 days, the symptoms worsened; the patient was unable to eat, drink, or take medications. She reported abdominal pain and cramping on the left side that she described as being similar to previous flares of ulcerative colitis; she also had nonbloody diarrhea. The patient called the obstetrics clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems was notable for fatigue, mild headache, neck pain, and photophobia. The patient reported no hematochezia, pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, dysuria, or joint pain. Ulcerative colitis had been diagnosed 11 years earlier; at the time of the diagnosis, she began treatment with azathioprine but stopped after 1 year because of severe fatigue. The patient had taken mesalamine and sulfasalazine intermittently for disease flares but typically stopped after a few months of treatment. Exacerbations of ulcerative colitis occurred approximately every year and were associated with fevers, rigors, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea.\nNine months before this admission, Clostridioides difficile colitis developed, and the patient was successfully treated with oral vancomycin. Three weeks before the current admission, she was admitted to this hospital for a flare of ulcerative colitis; intravenous methylprednisolone, hydromorphone, and ondansetron were administered, and mesalamine was restarted. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed mild erythema and friable mucosa with a decreased vascular pattern in the sigmoid colon.\nDr. Craig R. Audin: A transvaginal ultrasound image obtained during that admission showed a single viable intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks of gestation and trace subchorionic hemorrhage.\nDr. Tran: The patient was discharged after 7 days once most of the symptoms had abated, although nausea persisted. The patient had had two previous successful pregnancies that had resulted in cesarean deliveries at full term. The patient reported that she had received all the usual childhood immunizations. Routine prenatal serologic screening during the current pregnancy showed immunity to varicella but not to rubella. Tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Other history included anemia, chronic back pain, migraines, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety.\nAt the time of the current admission, medications included prednisone, mesalamine, omeprazole, ondansetron, hydromorphone, tramadol, cyclobenzaprine, sumatriptan, gabapentin, lorazepam, sertraline, pyridoxine, cholecalciferol, and prenatal vitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with her male partner, with whom she was monogamous, as well as her two children. She worked as an administrator. She did not eat sushi or rare or raw meat, and she did not consume unpasteurized milk or cheese. She had no known sick contacts or exposure to animals.

The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and care.\nThe next day, the abdominal pain persisted and was most severe in the right upper and right lower quadrants. The headache had increased in severity; it was pulsating in quality and was worst in the frontal region, with radiation to the occipital region and posterior neck. There was mild photophobia but no neck stiffness or limitation in the range of motion in the neck. Empirical treatment with intravenous ampicillin\u2013sulbactam and prophylaxis with oral vancomycin were started.\nOn the third hospital day, the systolic blood pressure declined to 70 mm Hg; after intravenous fluids were administered, the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Ultrasound images of the uterus obtained at the bedside confirmed a fetal heartbeat. A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless, with a glucose level of 63 mg per deciliter (3.5 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a protein level of 17 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were 0 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5). Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF revealed no neutrophils and very few mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified.\nDr. Audin: Three days later, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1C through 1F), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a normal gravid uterus. On T2-weighted imaging, there were rounded areas of myometrial thickening with low signal intensity that were consistent with focal myometrial contractions, as well as a thin band of low signal intensity surrounding the fetus that was consistent with chorioamniotic separation; both of these findings were considered to be normal in the first trimester. The appendix was normal, without wall thickening, dilatation, or adjacent inflammatory changes. Although evaluation of the bowel was limited in the absence of oral and intravenous contrast material, the rectum also appeared normal, without obvious signs of active or chronic inflammation.\nA diagnosis was made.", "ground_truth_output": "Listeria monocytogenes bacteremia resulting in loss of fetus."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Abigail L. Donovan: A 13-year-old boy with a history of attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of worsening depression, thoughts of self-injurious behavior, and suicidality.\nThe patient had a history of impulsivity and frequent episodes of self-injury, such as head-butting and cutting, which sometimes occurred while he was in treatment settings. Twelve months before the current presentation, he began to have suicidal ideation, with occasional suicidal planning and a suicide attempt. During the next year, the patient had 10 evaluations in the emergency department and six inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations.\nOne day before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from an inpatient psychiatric hospital, where he had been admitted and treated for 3 weeks because of urges to hurt himself. On the day of the current presentation, the patient visited his middle school and participated in therapy at home. Throughout the day, he noticed worsening depression and had recurrent thoughts of self-injury and suicide. He asked his parents to call emergency medical services because he felt unsafe in his home. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn arrival, the patient was in an agitated and combative state, reporting that he had changed his mind and no longer wanted to be in the hospital. Attempts at verbal deescalation were not effective. Treatment with intramuscular olanzapine was administered, and physical restraints were placed on his arms and legs. During the next 6 hours, the agitation decreased, and the physical restraints were removed. Additional history was obtained but was limited because the patient shrugged his shoulders in response to most questions. He described the school visit as difficult and uncomfortable. He did not indicate why he felt unsafe in his home; he reported that he had picked at scabs on his arms and legs in order to hurt himself and had ongoing suicidal ideation. The patient also reported difficulty sleeping and concentrating, as well as loss of interest and motivation, although he still enjoyed playing sports. He had no homicidal ideation, paranoid thoughts, or delusions.\nMedications included extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He lived in an urban area of New Hampshire with his mother, father, and sister.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 133/78 mm Hg, the heart rate 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared disheveled. There were scattered cuts and wounds in varying stages of healing on both arms. The patient was in a disengaged and agitated state. He had a depressed mood, a guarded affect, and difficulty concentrating. His speech was slow and soft, with reduced prosody. His thought process was logical and linear; the thought content was notable for suicidal ideation. He had no loosening of associations, delusions, or hallucinations. Insight and judgment were poor.\nThe patient was deemed to be at high risk for harm and was transferred to the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department. Transfer to an inpatient psychiatric hospital was requested, but no beds were available at any facility in the region. During the next 6 weeks, while the patient was awaiting admission to an inpatient psychiatric hospital, treatment with extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone was continued, and treatment with sertraline, diphenhydramine, and melatonin was initiated. He had frequent episodes of agitation, which led to the administration of oral clonidine or oral or intramuscular olanzapine as needed. He also had several episodes of self-injury; surveillance was heightened, with well-being checks performed every 15 minutes.\nOn day 41 in the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department, agitation developed, and a dose of oral olanzapine was administered in addition to scheduled medications. One hour later, agitation continued, and a dose of intramuscular olanzapine was administered. After the administration of intramuscular olanzapine, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 119/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air.\nThe next morning, the blood pressure was 146/87 mm Hg and the heart rate 52 beats per minute. There were no new symptoms; the examination was unchanged. Twelve hours later, the blood pressure was 69/39 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. The patient reported malaise and lightheadedness with standing, as well as nausea and abdominal pain. He appeared pale, tired, and lethargic. Oral rehydration was encouraged. One hour later, the blood pressure was 94/50 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. Three hours after the onset of hypotension, the blood pressure was 79/45 mm Hg and the heart rate 85 beats per minute.\nBlood and urine toxicologic screening was negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A blood specimen was obtained for culture. Intravenous fluids, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone were administered. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities.

Patel: A 62-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of recurrent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 months before the current admission, when pleuritic pain and tightness in her chest developed suddenly while she was eating. The chest pain persisted and began to radiate to the neck and back. The symptoms did not abate with aspirin or acetaminophen. Within an hour after symptom onset, she noticed that the pain worsened with exertion and when she was in the supine position; she was also unable to take a full breath and had dizziness with exertion. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 104 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/91 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Except for the finding of tachycardia, the examination was reportedly normal.

A chest radiograph reportedly showed a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Intravenous heparin was administered. Four hours later, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed according to a pulmonary embolism protocol, reportedly ruled out pulmonary embolism; it also revealed a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with an attenuation level of 34 to 50 Hounsfield units, a mildly dilated ascending aorta (at a diameter of 37 mm; normal diameter, <36 mm on the basis of the patient\u2019s sex and body-surface area), and a pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe that measured 4 mm in diameter. Intravenous heparin was stopped, and protamine sulfate was administered. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of a second hospital 3 hours later.\nOn arrival at the second hospital, the temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/75 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. Pulsus paradoxus measured 16 mm Hg. The jugular venous pressure was 12 cm of water. Auscultation revealed tachycardia and a pericardial friction rub. The remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the level of troponin were normal. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia and right-axis deviation, with minor nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities.\nDr. Daniela R. Crousillat: A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a small-to-moderate circumferential pericardial effusion primarily abutting the right atrium and right ventricle with right atrial inversion and intermittent diastolic inversion of the right ventricle (Figure 1A). There was increased respiratory variation in the mitral inflow velocities and a dilated inferior vena cava with reduced respirophasic collapse; both these features were suggestive of the presence of physiologic characteristics of early tamponade (Figure 1B and Video 1). Colchicine and ibuprofen were administered, and the patient was admitted to the second hospital.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies Obtained before This Admission.\nDr. Patel: The next morning, pericardiocentesis was performed under fluoroscopic guidance with the use of a subxiphoid approach, and 200 ml of bloody fluid was drained; the intrapericardial pressure decreased from 12 mm Hg to 4 mm Hg. Analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed 4,700,000 erythrocytes per microliter and 12,010 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 78% were neutrophils, 13% monocytes, 8% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. Gram\u2019s staining revealed neutrophils and no organisms. The pericardial fluid albumin level was 3.0 g per deciliter, the total protein level 4.7 g per deciliter, the lactate dehydrogenase level 614 U per liter, the glucose level 71 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter), and the amylase level 31 U per liter.\nDr. Vinit Baliyan: On the second hospital day, a CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest showed a reduction in hemopericardium, and a pericardial drain was visible; there was no aortic dissection. There was an atrial septal occluder device in place that appeared to be in an appropriate position. The device appeared to be relatively large and abutted the aortic root anteriorly (Figure 1C). However, there was no evidence of erosion of the device into the aortic wall (known as device erosion) or pseudoaneurysm formation (Figure 1D).\nDr. Patel: On the third hospital day, no pericardial effusion was detected on TTE. Cytologic analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed reactive mesothelial cells, neutrophils, histiocytes, and eosinophils, with no malignant cells. The patient was discharged home with prescriptions for colchicine and ibuprofen.\nTen days after discharge from the second hospital, the patient had a follow-up visit with her cardiologist and reported that the chest pain and dyspnea had resolved. The heart rate was 94 beats per minute, the blood pressure 159/88 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the examination was normal. The antinuclear antibody titer was 1:160, with a homogeneous pattern, and a test for rheumatoid factor was negative. CT of the chest, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small-volume pericardial effusion, mild bronchial wall thickening, and a 4-mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe. Colchicine treatment was stopped.\nSix weeks before the current admission, the patient called her primary care physician to report recurrent back pain and dyspnea that she noted were similar to her previous presentation; treatment with colchicine was resumed. During the next 12 days, sinus pressure, myalgias, nasal congestion, and cough productive of green sputum developed, and she was seen by her primary care physician. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, the blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 94% while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. A screening test for respiratory viruses was negative. A chest radiograph reportedly showed clear lungs. Doxycycline was prescribed.\nFour days before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by her cardiologist at this hospital and reported ongoing cough and dyspnea. The heart rate was 87 beats per minute, and the blood pressure was 138/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nDr. Crousillat: A TTE showed recurrence of a moderate pericardial effusion, measuring up to 14 mm in end diastole, that was adjacent to the right ventricular free wall. There was evidence of right ventricular diastolic inversion that was suggestive of the physiologic characteristics of tamponade (Figure 2A and 2B). The patient was admitted to the cardiology floor of this hospital.\nFIGURE 2\n\nEchocardiograms Obtained on This Admission.\nDr. Patel: On evaluation, the patient reported that she had had episodes of dyspnea and cough with sputum production and a decrease in exercise tolerance in the weeks before this admission. She had no known sick contacts.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for postoperative pulmonary embolism, hypertension, dyslipidemia, recurrent episodes of syncope with cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses on tilt testing, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (for which she used a continuous positive airway pressure device), obesity, tubular adenomas (colonic polyps), hepatic steatosis, hiatal hernia, osteopenia, and cataracts. She also had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; on previous pulmonary-function testing, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 0.92 liters (39% of the predicted value), and the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity was 47%.\nFive and a half years before the current admission, the patient had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and abdominoplasty that had resulted in postoperative hemorrhage; she had lost 44 kg of weight after the sleeve gastrectomy. Fourteen years before this admission, the patient had undergone percutaneous transcatheter closure of a fenestrated atrial septal defect (ASD) with an interatrial septal aneurysm and a right-to-left shunt that was possibly related to recurrent transient ischemic attacks; the procedure had been performed with a 30-mm Amplatzer septal occluder device. She had had mammography and cervical cancer screening within the 16 months before this admission.\nMedications included colchicine, apixaban, losartan, theophylline, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, a multivitamin, and inhaled tiotropium and mometasone\u2013formoterol, as well as furosemide and albuterol as needed. Topiramate had caused paresthesia. The patient lived in Massachusetts with her husband and was a business owner. She had a 40-pack-year history of cigarette smoking and had quit smoking 10 years earlier; she did not drink alcohol or use other substances. Her family history was notable for coronary artery disease in her mother and father, stroke in her maternal grandmother and paternal grandfather, and seizure in a nephew.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the heart rate 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Pulsus paradoxus measured 10 mm Hg. The height was 163 cm and the weight 67 kg; the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.2. On examination, the jugular venous pressure was 10 cm of water. Auscultation revealed tachycardia, with no murmur or rub. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An ECG showed irregular tachycardia of uncertain underlying rhythm, low voltage in the limb leads, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and a rightward axis.\nDiagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Amplatzer septal occluder device erosion."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Amiko M. Uchida (Medicine): A 57-year-old man was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of new ascites.\nTwenty years before the current presentation, the patient began to have swelling of the legs, which initially occurred only after airplane trips. During the fifth decade of life, the leg swelling was present on a daily basis. Thirteen years before the current presentation, the patient began to have frequent bowel movements (up to four per day) with loose malodorous stools and increased flatus. He was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. On examination, the abdomen was soft and nontender, with no evidence of organomegaly. There was pitting edema in both legs. The blood level of total protein was 5.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 6.0 to 8.3), and the blood albumin level was 3.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.3 to 5.0). Results of other liver-function tests, including liver enzyme levels, were normal. The protein level in a 24-hour urine sample was normal. The blood alpha1-antitrypsin level was 173 mg per deciliter (reference value, <54). Blood levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM were low. Serologic tests for anti\u2013tissue transglutaminase antibodies and anti-giardia antibodies were negative.\nDr. Mark A. Anderson: Computed tomographic (CT) enterography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed diffuse mural thickening and hyperenhancement of the small bowel, with no evidence of stricturing or obstruction (Figure 1A and 1B). In addition, there was trace ascites (Figure 1B).\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies.\nDr. Uchida: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy revealed no visible abnormalities. A random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed a focal area with more than 70 eosinophils per high-power field; a biopsy specimen of the gastric antrum showed scattered eosinophils in the lamina propria. A working diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy was made, although neither a 2-week course of oral prednisone nor a 6-week course of oral budesonide led to a decrease in the number of bowel movements or leg edema. No further treatment was pursued.\nEleven years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. There had been no weight loss or recurrent infections, but leg edema persisted. Repeat EGD revealed no visible abnormalities, and a random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed fewer eosinophils than the previous specimen, with no epithelial damage. CT enterography revealed diffuse wall thickening of the entire small bowel and trace ascites. Treatment for protein-losing enteropathy \u2014 which included limiting salt intake, increasing dietary protein, and wearing compression stockings \u2014 was recommended. During the next 10 years, the leg edema was stable and was occasionally treated with diuretic agents, which did not lead to substantial improvement.\nSix months before the current presentation, the patient began to have dyspnea on exertion. Three months before this presentation, abdominal distention developed. The patient initially attributed the dyspnea and abdominal distention to weight gain due to reduced physical activity during quarantine for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Six weeks before this presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician in a video conference. On the basis of this evaluation, laboratory and imaging studies were obtained. The blood level of total protein was 4.5 g per deciliter (updated reference range, 6.4 to 8.3), and the blood albumin level was 2.1 g per deciliter. The complete blood count, blood levels of electrolytes and glucose, and results of liver-function and kidney-function tests were normal.\nDr. Anderson: CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules, enlarged subcarinal and upper mesenteric lymph nodes, and moderate-volume ascites in the upper abdomen.\nDr. Uchida: Three weeks later, paracentesis was performed, and 3.1 liters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. Cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.\nTABLE 1\n\nAscitic Fluid Analysis.\nVariable, 3 Wk before Current Presentation, 2 Wk after Current Presentation\n\nRed-cell count (per \u00b5l), <10,000, >3,000\nNucleated-cell count (per \u00b5l), 269, 226\n\nDifferential count (%):\nNeutrophils, 11, 9\nMononuclear cells, 89, 24\nLymphocytes, 0, 58\n\nAmylase (U/liter), 10, \u2014\nCholesterol (mg/dl), 43, \u2014\nTriglycerides (mg/dl), 797, 146\nTotal protein (g/dl), 1.3, 1.4\nAlbumin (g/dl), 0.5, 0.3\nGlucose (mg/dl), 379, 437\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/liter), 60, \u2014\n\nOn the current presentation, the patient reported that he was having bowel movements with normally formed stools and no abdominal pain. His wife had noticed that he appeared to be moving slowly when performing activities of daily living and that he had lost muscle mass in his arms. There was no history of abdominal surgery or trauma to the abdomen. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, osteoarthritis, and hypogammaglobulinemia. There was no history of recurrent infections, asthma, or atopic dermatitis. Medications included aspirin, insulin glargine, and metformin. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his wife in a suburb of Boston and worked in an office. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother had colon cancer.\nThe physical examination was limited, because the evaluation was done in a video conference in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Anderson: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed multiple new hypoenhancing lesions throughout the right and left hepatic lobes, diffuse small-bowel wall thickening, moderate-volume ascites, upper abdominal varices, and enlarged upper abdominal and pelvic nodes (Figure 1C, 1D, and 1E). The only liver lesions that were large enough for reliable percutaneous sampling were at the far cranial aspect of the hepatic dome, where respiratory motion and crossing the diaphragm would have made an attempt at CT-guided or ultrasonographically guided biopsy very challenging, if not prohibitive. CT of the chest revealed tree-in-bud and clustered nodules, predominantly in the dependent lower lobes, and right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy (Figure 1F).\nDr. Uchida: Tests for hepatitis C virus antibodies and for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, surface antigen, and core antibodies were negative. Repeat paracentesis was performed, and 3.2 liters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. An acid-fast stain of a concentrated specimen of ascitic fluid was negative. Cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. A fluoroscopically guided transjugular liver biopsy was also performed. The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was 2 mm Hg (normal value, <5); the right atrial pressure was 7 mm Hg, the wedged hepatic venous pressure 11 mm Hg, and the free hepatic venous pressure 9 mm Hg.\nDr. Megan J.

When the patient was 2 months of age, he had poor growth and frequent bowel movements with loose stools. When he began to eat solid foods, diarrhea continued, and a hydrolyzed-protein diet was started. His parents were instructed to remove dairy, soy, and gluten from his diet, but diarrhea did not abate. Allergy skin-prick testing with cow\u2019s milk and soy antigens was negative.\nWhen the patient was 10 months of age, failure to thrive and diarrhea persisted, and generalized edema and nephrotic syndrome developed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and diffuse inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy reportedly showed mild degenerative changes of the surface epithelium and mild focal microvillous atrophy; there were no immune deposits, and the basement membrane was normal.\nRenal biopsy was also performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen revealed glomeruli with diffuse thickening of the basement membrane; there was no proliferation of cells or mesangial matrix. Transmission electron microscopy showed total effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes and an irregularly thickened glomerular basement membrane with numerous subepithelial and intramembranous electron-dense deposits. The patient received a working diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome due to membranous glomerulonephritis, and treatment with prednisone was started.\nDiarrhea abated, proteinuria and generalized edema resolved, and growth resumed. However, during the next 2 years, intermittent relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome occurred when the dose of prednisone was decreased. When the patient was 3 years of age, treatment with chlorambucil was started for recurrent membranous glomerulonephritis, and there were no relapses for 1 year.\nWhen the patient was 4 years of age, there was a recurrence of diarrhea associated with fever and hemolytic anemia. Stool culture, stool testing for Clostridioides difficile toxin, and examination of the stool for ova and parasites were all negative. EGD was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and active enteritis. The blood IgE level was 501 IU per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 100). The blood level of endomysial antibodies was not elevated, but anti\u2013epithelial cell antibodies were detected. The patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy, and treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was begun.\nAfter several months, treatment with glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was stopped, and tacrolimus was begun. Tacrolimus was stopped after several years, when the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved. From 5 to 13 years of age, he had no enteropathy, anemia, or nephropathy.\nBeginning at 13 years of age, the patient was hospitalized for recurrences of diarrhea and nephropathy every 2 to 4 years during the 20 years before this evaluation. Six years before this evaluation, EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the duodenal and colonic mucosa appeared diffusely edematous. Biopsy specimens were obtained.\nDr. Stuti G. Shroff: Examination of a duodenal biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed marked villous blunting, an increase in lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria (known as lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria), and a patchy increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. Examination of a colonic biopsy specimen revealed mild focal active colitis that spared the rectum.\nFIGURE 1\n\nSmall-Intestinal Biopsy Specimens.\nDr. Hatipoglu: Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was begun, and diarrhea abated. For the next 2 years, relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone in combination with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil.\nFour years before this evaluation, antibodies against the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor were not detected. Renal biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen again revealed evidence of membranous glomerulonephritis. Treatment was changed to prednisone, budesonide, and abatacept, and symptoms abated. After 2 years, the patient stopped taking abatacept. After another 2 years, diarrhea recurred, and the patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the gastroenterology clinic, additional history was obtained. There was a history of hypertension, gallstones, and rosacea. Eczema had developed when the patient was 10 months of age and had occurred intermittently into adulthood; it had abated with the administration of immunosuppressive agents. Anaphylactic shock had occurred when the patient was 2 years of age after he had been exposed to uncooked egg. At that time, allergy testing was performed, and the patient\u2019s parents were instructed to remove eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, and shellfish from his diet, in addition to removing dairy, soy, and gluten.\nCurrent medications included prednisone, budesonide, and losartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a Mid-Atlantic state and worked as a salesperson. He did not smoke tobacco and drank beer rarely. His family history included ovarian cancer in his mother and skin cancer in his father; his brother was healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/94 mm Hg, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.1. The patient had short stature and diffuse erythema of the face and neck. There was mild tenderness in the left lower abdomen. The results of a lactulose breath test were normal, as was the fecal calprotectin level. Testing for antibodies to tissue transglutaminase was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the findings were consistent with duodenitis, gastritis, and atrophy of the colon.

He was unable to give additional details of his history, but he provided the name of the hospital where he routinely received care. On a phone consultation, physicians at that hospital reported that the patient had a history of traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, seizure disorder, chronic back pain due to spinal stenosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety. Prescribed medications included lisinopril and transdermal lidocaine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had consumed alcohol in the past but not for 40 years.

The blood levels of lipase, magnesium, and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. There was mild normocytic anemia, but the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Samples of blood and urine were obtained for culture.

Applewhite: Radiographs of the chest and pelvis showed no acute abnormalities. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1A) revealed nonspecific mild white-matter changes, a nonspecific small focal calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter, atherosclerosis without high-grade cerebrovascular stenosis, and multilevel spondylotic changes without severe spinal canal stenosis. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarction. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1B and 1C) revealed no evidence of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, lung consolidation, or pericardial effusion. There was a left adrenal nodule that measured 19 mm in diameter, a finding consistent with an adenoma.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies.\nDr. Karandinos: Normal saline with 5% dextrose was administered intravenously. During the next 8 hours, the patient was agitated and combative. He repeatedly removed peripheral intravenous catheters and disconnected monitors. He was no longer oriented to place or time. Two doses of olanzapine were administered intravenously, and the patient slept for several hours during the night.\nSixteen hours after the patient arrived in the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the blood pressure 160/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The patient was observed to be breathing deeply. He was able to state his name, but his speech was otherwise nonsensical and dysarthric. He followed commands only when visual cues were given; for example, he stuck out his tongue after the examiner demonstrated the task. Motor, sensory, and reflex examinations were normal; tests of cerebellar function were not performed. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The results of electroencephalography (EEG) were normal, without epileptiform abnormalities. Normal saline with potassium chloride was administered intravenously, as was lorazepam. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Applewhite: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2) revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute or subacute infarction. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed a mild burden of white-matter signal hyperintensities, which are nonspecific but typical of chronic small-vessel disease. The previously detected calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter correlated with an 8-mm focus of T1 and T2 signal abnormalities with associated susceptibility blooming, a finding suggestive of either a calcified cavernous malformation or sequelae of previous infection or inflammation.\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Karandinos: The patient\u2019s mental status did not improve. Twenty-four hours after he arrived in the emergency department, he was admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of seizure. The temporal temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 151/70 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. Respiratory effort appeared increased. He was somnolent, and he followed simple commands but did not open his eyes in response to sternal rub. The blood levels of creatine kinase, fibrinogen, and ammonia were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nThiamine was administered intravenously.

Wing: A 48-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fatigue and swelling in both legs.\nThe patient had been well until 8 months before the current admission, when fatigue and lethargy developed. He thought the fatigue was associated with alcohol consumption and reduced his intake to 12 beers weekly; before this, he had consumed 24 beers weekly for 15 years. Three months before the current admission, the patient\u2019s weight had decreased by 9.1 kg. However, 3 weeks before this admission, the weight had increased by 9.6 kg and swelling developed in both legs. He thought the weight gain was related to diet changes, including consumption of pizza, pasta, and soup, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nOne week before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He was instructed to elevate his legs, wear compression stockings, and decrease dietary sodium to 2 g daily. On the day of the current admission, the leg swelling had not abated and new abdominal distention occurred. He called the primary care clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, a review of systems was notable for fatigue, lethargy, decreased appetite, abdominal bloating, constipation, penile swelling, decreased libido, intolerance of cold temperatures, and ankle and knee pain in both legs that was worse when the patient was climbing stairs. There was no fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, or hematochezia.\nSixteen months before the current evaluation, the patient had been admitted to this hospital with pneumonia involving the right upper and middle lobes that was due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. During that admission, he received diagnoses of diabetes and normocytic anemia. After discharge from the hospital, laboratory evaluation revealed a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.1% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4). Metformin was prescribed, and follow-up evaluation was recommended; however, the patient had not returned to the primary care clinic before the current illness.\nThe patient had not started taking metformin until 3 weeks before the current evaluation; he took no other medications and had no known drug allergies.

Walton (Medicine): A 67-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of headache and retro-orbital pain.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 10 months before the current admission, when a photosensitive, erythematous, papular rash developed on the forearms a few weeks after she had started treatment with hydrochlorothiazide. Over the next 7 months, an intermittent, painless, nonpruritic, erythematous, annular rash developed on the trunk and the proximal portions of the arms and legs.\nThree months before the current presentation, the rashes worsened, and the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist at another hospital. The thyrotropin level was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of a punch-biopsy specimen of abdominal skin reportedly showed spongiotic dermatitis with superficial perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory-cell infiltrate with eosinophils; neither vasculitis nor dermal mucin was found. The rashes were thought to be related to medication; treatment with amlodipine was started, and hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. She was treated with topical triamcinolone ointment. The photosensitive rash on the forearms resolved, and the annular rash on the trunk abated.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults, First Hospital), 3 Mo before Current Admission (First Hospital), Reference Range (Adults, This Hospital), On Current Admission (This Hospital)\n\nAntinuclear antibody, Negative, Positive at 1:320 with a speckled pattern, Negative at 1:80 and 1:160, Positive at 1:640 with a homogeneous pattern\nAnti-dsDNA antibody (U), 0\u201330.0, 16.3, Negative, Negative\nAnti-RNP antibody (U), 0\u201320, 3, 0\u201319.99, 1.48\nAnti-Smith antibody (U), 0\u201320, 4, 0\u201319.99, 2.74\nAnti-SSA antibody (U), 0\u201320, 71, 0\u201319.99, 80.76\nAnti-SSB antibody (U), 0\u201320, 7, 0\u201319.99, 6.69\n\nTen days after the evaluation at the first hospital, and 8 weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to the emergency department of a second hospital because of progressive temporal headache with retro-orbital pain on the left side that had lasted for 3 days. The physical examination was reportedly normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 19). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. Computed tomography (CT) of the head was performed and reportedly showed mild periventricular white-matter disease with no acute intracranial abnormality. CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed no intracranial aneurysm, stenosis, or occlusion. The patient was discharged home.\nThe next morning, the patient awoke with double vision. The headache had resolved. She presented to a neuro-ophthalmology urgent care clinic associated with this hospital. The patient reported persistent pain in the left eye, which was worse with abduction, as well as photosensitivity and an episode of pain in the left side of the jaw in the preceding week. She had normal visual acuity, color vision, visual fields, and afferent visual function. The optic disks were normal, sharp, and flat. The left eye had esotropia and hypertropia, as well as a limitation in abduction. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 11 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level was 3.0 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). A presumptive diagnosis of acute left sixth cranial nerve palsy associated with cerebral microvascular disease was considered. Corrective treatment with eye patching was recommended, and the double vision resolved over the next 3 weeks.\nEight weeks after she had presented to the emergency department of the second hospital, the patient presented to the emergency department of a third hospital because similar symptoms had developed in her right eye. She reported having headache with retro-orbital pain on the right side over the past 3 days, accompanied by changes in her color vision and occasional floaters. The physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of 159/66 mm Hg and an abduction deficit of the right eye. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 17 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 30), and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was 1.64 mg per liter (reference value, <3.00). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. A screening test for Lyme disease antibodies was negative.\nDr. Jeremy N. Ford: Cross-sectional imaging of the head and orbits had been performed at the first hospital, and the results were reinterpreted at the third hospital. CT of the head (Figure 1A and 1B) reportedly showed stranding of the intraconal fat in the right orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography of the head, neck, and orbits (performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material) reportedly showed abnormal enhancement and edema of the optic nerve and surrounding tissue on the right side. On my directed review of the MRI (Figure 1C through 1F), I found that the mild edema and enhancement predominantly involved the optic-nerve sheath and intraconal fat, which confirmed the findings on CT of the head. The optic nerve itself was largely spared. The temporomandibular joints were partially visible, and there was mild periarticular edema and enhancement of the left joint. On T2-weighted imaging, scattered hyperintense foci were seen in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, a nonspecific finding most likely attributable to chronic small-vessel disease.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Walton: Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was transferred to the neurology unit of this hospital. On evaluation, she reported persistent double vision and pain on right lateral gaze but resolution of the retro-orbital headache. She also reported a recent mild flare of an erythematous, annular rash, as well as recent hair thinning and long-standing Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Review of systems was negative for fever, night sweats, weight loss, joint erythema or swelling, muscle stiffness or pain, scalp or temple tenderness, jaw claudication, recurrent sinusitis, nasal crusting, epistaxis, cough, hoarseness, cough or shortness of breath, hemoptysis, dry mouth or dry eyes, oral ulcers, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, hearing changes, paresthesia, weakness in the arms and legs, or changes in the nails. There were no gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms.\nThe patient had a remote history of Graves\u2019 disease with orbitopathy that had been diagnosed and treated more than two decades before this presentation. The medical history was also notable for hypothyroidism, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cholecystectomy, ovary-sparing hysterectomy, and lumpectomy for estrogen receptor\u2013positive, progesterone receptor\u2013positive breast cancer. A surveillance mammogram obtained in the previous month had reportedly been normal. She had received three vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Medications included atorvastatin, amlodipine, levothyroxine, and tamoxifen. A rash had occurred after the previous use of hydrochlorothiazide. She was married and lived in coastal Massachusetts. She drank wine rarely and did not use tobacco or other substances. Her family history was notable for a maternal aunt with thyroid disease and a child with vitiligo.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the pulse 68 beats per minute, the blood pressure 173/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A few scattered erythematous macules were present on the abdomen, including a well-healed punch-biopsy site. A few telangiectasias were observed on the face. There was no rash on the face or scalp, and no sclerodactyly was observed. The hair was normal in pattern and distribution. There was no conjunctival injection. Extraocular movements were normal except for abduction of the right eye, which was limited and caused pain. There was no proptosis or lid lag. Visual acuity was 20/25 in the left eye and 20/40 with red color desaturation in the right eye. The right optic disk appeared pale as compared with the left optic disk. The remainder of the general and neurologic examination was normal.\nAn electrocardiogram was normal. The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, albumin, and globulin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 6 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level was 0.6 mg per liter. Screening tests for antibodies to hepatitis B virus core antigen, hepatitis C virus, histone, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative, as were tests for Lyme disease antibodies, syphilis antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and varicella\u2013zoster virus IgM; varicella\u2013zoster virus IgG was detected. A test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and serum and urine toxicology screens were also negative.\nA lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear, with an opening pressure of 14 cm of water. Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF showed rare mononuclear cells and no organisms. The CSF glucose level was 86 mg per deciliter (4.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and the CSF protein level was 30 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were no nucleated cells present.\nOn the second day, testing for antibodies to bartonella was negative. The levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme, C3, and C4 were normal, as were the results of serum free light-chain testing, serum protein electrophoresis, and urinalysis. The IgG4 level was 137.3 mg per deciliter (reference range, 3.9 to 86.4); the levels of other IgG subclasses were normal. Testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \u03b22-glycoprotein 1 antibodies was negative, as was CSF testing for cryptococcal antigen and varicella\u2013zoster virus IgM.\nDr. Ford: CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no lymphadenopathy; there was hepatic steatosis and a 2-mm right apical nodule. MRI of the head and whole spine, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed asymmetric enhancement surrounding the intraorbital and intracanalicular segments of the right optic-nerve sheath and intraconal fat. No abnormal spinal cord enhancement was observed. Ultrasonography of the temporal arteries showed no halo sign.\nDr. Walton: A diagnostic test was performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody\u2013associated vasculitis."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Weizhen Tan: A 19-year-old man was evaluated in the nephrology clinic of this hospital because of kidney cysts.\nThe patient had been well until 3 years before the current presentation, when diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and increased urinary frequency developed. The patient\u2019s mother brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported that he woke up 3 or 4 times each night to urinate. He also had weight loss, decreased appetite, and increased thirst. The temporal temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 123/70 mm Hg, and the heart rate 65 beats per minute. The weight was 51.3 kg, the height 165 cm, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 18.8. The patient had dry skin; the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood glucose level was 780 mg per deciliter (43.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]), and the glycated hemoglobin level was 12.9% (reference range, 4.3 to 5.6). The blood creatinine level was 1.45 mg per deciliter (128 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]).

Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Samantha G. Harrington: Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant (Figure 1A) showed a normal-appearing gallbladder and common bile duct. The right kidney was partially visualized and had two cysts, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter; the left kidney was not seen. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (Figure 1B and 1C) showed a normal-appearing liver, biliary system, and spleen. The pancreatic head and neck were smaller than expected, and the body and tail of the pancreas were absent. There were multiple bilateral simple kidney cysts, ranging in size from 2 to 18 mm.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Tan: After these imaging studies were obtained, the patient did not return for scheduled follow-up in the gastroenterology clinic. One year later, and 1 week before the current presentation, the patient returned for follow-up. He had no symptoms, and the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The MRCP findings were unchanged from the previous evaluation. The patient was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospital for evaluation of his kidney cysts.\nIn the nephrology clinic, the patient reported that he felt well. He had had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccinations. Medications included insulin degludec and insulin lispro. There were no known drug allergies. He was a senior in high school and worked part-time at a restaurant. He lived in an apartment in a suburban area of New England with his mother and three siblings. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had prediabetes, obesity, and hypertension; his mother and three siblings were healthy. His paternal grandfather, maternal grandfather, and maternal great-grandfather had diabetes.\nThe blood pressure was 124/66 mm Hg and the heart rate 76 beats per minute. The weight was 65.5 kg, the height 176 cm, and the BMI 21.2. The examination was normal. Analysis of a freshly voided urine specimen revealed 1+ proteinuria, 2+ glucosuria, and trace ketonuria. Microscopic examination showed one mixed granular cast per low-power field and scattered squamous epithelial cells. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Harrington: Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder showed increased renal parenchymal echogenicity and loss of corticomedullary differentiation in both kidneys.

Diacovo (Pediatrics): An 11-year-old girl was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of redness of the eyes.\nThe patient had been well until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when she noticed mild eye redness, which was worse in the right eye than in the left eye. There was intermittent swelling of the eyelids but no photophobia, itching, pain, tearing, or discharge. The patient\u2019s parents administered naphazoline hydrochloride and glycerin eye drops, but the eye redness did not abate. When the eye redness had persisted for 2 weeks, the patient was taken to the pediatrics clinic of another hospital. She was given a 7-day course of an oral antibiotic agent as empirical treatment for possible preseptal cellulitis.\nFive weeks before the current evaluation, the eye redness persisted despite treatment, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital. The blood pressure was not measured during this evaluation. The visual acuity with correction was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination revealed abundant white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were also keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and rare iris nodules in the right eye. Funduscopic examination was notable for optic-disk swelling and peripheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes, as well as perivascular exudates in the right eye. Cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes were prescribed.\nDuring the subsequent 3 weeks, additional tests were performed in the pediatrics clinic of the other hospital. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, syphilis, and Lyme disease were negative.

Slit-lamp examination revealed keratic precipitates and white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were extensive posterior synechiae in the right eye. Funduscopic examination (Figure 2) showed vitreous white cells, optic-disk swelling, perivascular exudates, peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nFIGURE 2\n\nFundus Photographs.\nDuring the next 4 days, additional tests were performed, and sputum specimens were obtained for an acid-fast bacilli smear and culture. Optical coherence tomography revealed optic-disk swelling but no cystoid macular swelling. Fluorescein angiography revealed optic-disk leakage with areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion and some vessel leakage.\nDr. Figueiro Longo: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1C), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed protrusion and enhancement of the optic disks and enhancement of the irises, a finding consistent with the clinical diagnosis of uveitis. There was no evidence of optic neuritis or perineuritis.\nDr. Diacovo: The administration of cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes was continued. Treatment with oral prednisone was started, and a regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was begun as empirical treatment for possible tuberculosis. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. She was instructed to follow up in the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital and was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the rheumatology clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient had had normal growth and development and was currently in middle school. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had emigrated from West Africa to the United States 6 years earlier; since then, she had lived with her mother and father in a suburban town in New England and had not traveled outside the region. Six months before this evaluation, an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for M. tuberculosis had been positive. At that time, the patient had received a prescription for a medication to treat latent tuberculosis infection; however, the patient\u2019s parents could not recall giving the medication to the patient. She was taking the prescribed cyclopentolate and prednisolone eye drops, oral prednisone, and regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. There were no known drug allergies.

Okonkwo (Neurology): An 80-year-old man was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of left foot drop.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 5 years before the current presentation, when he first noticed that he needed to lift up his left leg while walking in order to prevent the toes of his left foot from dragging on the ground. During the next 2 years, his ability to dorsiflex the left ankle decreased progressively. Three years before this presentation, he began to use an ankle\u2013foot orthosis.\nOne year before this presentation, the patient was evaluated in a neurology clinic affiliated with another hospital. He reported left foot drop, as well as occasional falls that he attributed to poor balance. Examination reportedly revealed wasting in the muscles below the left knee, weakness with attempts at dorsiflexion and eversion of the left ankle, loss of pinprick sensation to the midshins in both legs, and decreased vibratory sensation in the toes of both feet. The blood levels of cobalamin, folate, thyrotropin, and glycated hemoglobin and the results of serum protein electrophoresis were reportedly normal. Tests for syphilis and antinuclear antibodies were negative, as were blood tests for antibodies to sulfate-3-glucuronyl paragloboside and myelin-associated glycoprotein and a serum paraneoplastic autoantibody panel. The blood creatine kinase level was 456 IU per liter (reference range, 30 to 194) and the aldolase level 5.8 U per liter (reference value, <8.1). Imaging studies were obtained.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was reportedly normal. MRI of the lumbar spine reportedly revealed diffuse disk bulging with facet hypertrophy at multiple levels, which was contributing to mild spinal stenosis. Needle electromyography (EMG) of the left leg reportedly showed changes consistent with moderate-to-severe, subacute-to-chronic radiculopathy at L5 and S1 on the left side.\nThe patient declined further workup at that time. One year later, his symptoms had not resolved, and he presented to the neurology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn the current evaluation, the patient reported stable left foot drop and mild low-back pain without radiating symptoms. He had no bowel or bladder changes, no double vision or hearing changes, and no difficulty with breathing, chewing, or swallowing. His medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, and adenocarcinoma of the prostate, which had been treated with local radiation therapy 4 years before this presentation. Medications included aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, metoprolol, and simvastatin. The patient was married, resided in New England, and was retired from work in the insurance industry. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit smoking 30 years before this presentation. He drank four alcoholic drinks per day. His sister had breast cancer, and his father had died in his 70s from esophageal cancer.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 140/60 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.1. He had a steppage gait pattern with prominent left foot drop. He could not walk on his left heel, but he was able to walk on his left toes and to walk with a tandem gait.\nThere was mild facial weakness, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side, with an asymmetric smile and weak eye closure and cheek puffing. The optic disks had sharp margins. The pupils were round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were full. There was no weakness or atrophy of the jaw, palate, or tongue. Hearing was grossly intact. Shoulder shrug was asymmetric, with less rise on the right side. A motor examination revealed wasting of the shoulder girdle, which was more prominent on the right side, and wasting of the calves. Tone was mildly decreased throughout, and there were no fasciculations. There was severe scapular winging, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side. There was no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia.\nStrength was assessed according to the Medical Research Council scale, which ranges from 0 (no visible muscle contraction) to 5 (normal strength). On the right and left sides, strength was 4 and 4+, respectively, on shoulder abduction; 5 and 3 on ankle dorsiflexion; 4+ and 4 on big-toe extension; 5 and 4+ on ankle inversion; and 5 and 4\u2212 on ankle eversion. On both sides, strength was 4+ on hip flexion and was normal on neck flexion and extension, elbow flexion and extension, wrist flexion and extension, finger extension and abduction, thumb abduction, hip abduction, knee flexion and extension, and plantar flexion. Deep-tendon reflexes were 1+ at the biceps, 1+ at the triceps, trace at the brachioradialis, 2+ at the knees, and not elicited at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor. There was loss of pinprick and temperature sensations to the midshins in both legs, as well as decreased vibratory sensation to the ankles. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Karen A. Buch: MRI of the lumbar spine (Figure 1) revealed a large, leftward, eccentric disk herniation at L5 and S1 that impinged on the exiting L5 nerve roots, with greater impingement on the left side than on the right side. There was narrowing of the left subarticular zone and left lateral recess that encroached on the descending left S1 nerve root. Facet hypertrophy and ligamentous infolding at multiple levels were contributing to mild central spinal stenosis.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Lumbar Spine.\nDr. Okonkwo: Additional testing was performed, and a diagnosis was made.", "ground_truth_output": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Will Pohlman (Medicine): An 82-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of difficulty walking, falls, and cognitive decline.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health, living independently with her husband and participating in a walking club, until 8 months before the current presentation, when generalized weakness developed. She began to walk more slowly and was no longer active with her walking club; she felt limited by pain in her feet.\nFive months before the current presentation, the patient began to have difficulty with climbing stairs and with rising from a seated position. Four months before the current presentation, she began to have falls at home.\nThree months before the current presentation, the patient fell and her husband was not able to lift her up from the floor. Emergency medical services were called, and she was admitted to another hospital for evaluation. During that hospitalization, a urinary tract infection and hyponatremia were diagnosed. The urinary tract infection was treated with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. The hyponatremia was attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone and was treated with fluid restriction and salt tablets. The use of a walker was recommended, and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. After 3 weeks in the rehabilitation facility, she was discharged home, but she fell again at home and subsequently returned to the other hospital for evaluation. She was readmitted to the other hospital and again discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\nEight weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from the rehabilitation facility, and she and her husband moved to an assisted-living facility. Fatigue developed, along with loss of appetite and a reduced intake of food. The patient began to need one-person assistance to walk. She also noticed that she had been having difficulty with math associated with the family finances, which she had always done with ease. Her family noticed that she had been having trouble carrying on a conversation and that she seemed less attentive than usual.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, the patient had another fall and was admitted to a second hospital, where she was found to have hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head reportedly showed moderate chronic small-vessel ischemic changes and ventriculomegaly. Increased food intake was encouraged, and outpatient evaluation in the neurology clinic affiliated with the second hospital was arranged. Discharge to a rehabilitation facility was recommended, but after discussions between the patient and her family, the patient returned to the assisted-living facility.\nAfter discharge from the hospital, the patient had a progressive loss of independence. She noted worsening generalized weakness and low back pain, and she needed two-person assistance to walk. Her family brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported urinary incontinence, which she attributed to not having enough time to get to the toilet because of her physical limitations with movement; she had no dysuria or urinary urgency. There was no fecal incontinence.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. Surgical history included hemiarthroplasty of the right shoulder and arthroplasty of both knees. She had chronic pain in the shoulders, knees, wrists, and hands, which had been attributed to osteoarthritis; the knee and shoulder pain had decreased after the surgeries but then returned during the year before the current presentation. Medications included atorvastatin, calcium citrate, levothyroxine, lisinopril, and tramadol. She had no known drug allergies. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. In addition to her husband, her support network included four children who lived near the assisted-living facility. She was retired and had previously worked in finance. Her mother had had diabetes, and her father had had thyroid cancer; there was no known family history of dementia or neurodegenerative disorders.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/54 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. She appeared tired but was oriented to person and place. Pitting edema was present in the legs to the level of the mid-shins. A detailed strength examination was limited because of pain, with minimal movement of the shoulders, wrists, fingers, ankles, and knees. The patient could wiggle her toes but had weak plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of both feet. She could easily wiggle her fingers and lift her arms against gravity at the elbows. Light touch of the dorsum of the right hand caused pain, as did light touch of the right knee and the soles of both feet. Recognition of sensation to light touch and to vibration were normal. Cerebellar testing, gait testing, and reflex testing were limited by severe pain with movement and touch. The patient had symmetric erythema, swelling, and tenderness of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. She had limited range of motion in the wrists and elbows, along with symmetric tenderness in the subtalar joints and swelling and pain with squeezing of the metatarsophalangeal joints.\nThe blood levels of alcohol, ammonia, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and urine toxicology screening; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 3+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative) and the presence of nitrates (reference value, negative), and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). Urine was obtained for culture, and intravenous ceftriaxone was administered.

Normal-pressure hydrocephalus was generally thought to be unlikely to explain her presentation. Altered mental status was attributed to delirium in the context of tramadol use and urinary tract infection. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nOn hospital day 2, the urine culture grew Citrobacter farmeri; treatment with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was started. MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was terminated early because of the patient\u2019s pain, and the images that were obtained were degraded by motion artifacts. However, no marked signal abnormality in the spinal cord or high-grade spinal or foraminal stenosis was observed. Additional laboratory studies were obtained. Tests for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus antibodies, and hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative. The blood levels of glycated hemoglobin and cobalamin were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation; blood samples were obtained for measurement of copper and vitamin B6 levels. Treatment with gabapentin was started for neuropathic pain. On hospital day 3, pain had not decreased, and the dose of gabapentin was increased.\nDr. Bart K. Chwalisz: On hospital day 4, electromyography and nerve conduction studies were performed. The amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was normal with stimulation of the right tibial nerve but was reduced with stimulation of the left tibial nerve and both peroneal nerves; in addition, the CMAP amplitude of the left ulnar nerve was mildly reduced, and that of the left median nerve was normal. The sensory-nerve action potential of the left radial nerve was normal, but the sensory-nerve action potential of the left sural nerve could not be obtained. The conduction velocities and distal latencies were normal. There was no abnormal spontaneous activity in any muscle examined. The motor-unit action potentials and motor-unit recruitment with voluntary activation were normal throughout.\nDr. Pohlman: The results of the additional blood tests became available. The copper level was normal, and the vitamin B6 level was less than 2 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50). Treatment with vitamin B6 supplementation was started.\nAdditional diagnostic tests were performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Rheumatoid arthritis with vasculitis causing a confluent mononeuritis multiplex."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Miranda M. Ravicz (Pediatrics): A 20-year-old man with bipolar disorder was transferred to this hospital because of hemoptysis and hypoxemia.\nEleven months before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Six weeks before the current presentation, he was taken to another hospital for evaluation of racing thoughts, generalized hyperactivity, and difficulty sleeping. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. During the admission, the patient was involved in an altercation and was struck on the left side of the chest; pain subsequently developed in that area. Five weeks before the current presentation, chest pain persisted, and nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite developed. The patient was transported from the psychiatric hospital to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Teresa Victoria: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies.\nDr. Ravicz: The patient was told that he had a pulmonary contusion and was transported back to the psychiatric hospital. The dosages of quetiapine and paliperidone were increased. Four weeks before the current presentation, the patient had urticaria and intermittent nausea; a single dose of methylprednisolone was administered. Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged home.\nTen days before the current presentation, chest pain continued, cough developed, and nausea increased in severity. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a second hospital. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest (Figure 1B) revealed a consolidation in the left lower lobe and a left pleural effusion.\nDr. Ravicz: A course of doxycycline was started for the treatment of presumed pneumonia, and the patient was discharged home. During the subsequent 6 days, the cough and chest pain abated. Four days before the current presentation, the course of doxycycline was completed. During the next several days, the cough increased in severity and became productive of yellow sputum with dark-red streaks, and shortness of breath developed; nausea also increased in severity. One day before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated again in the emergency department of the second hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient appeared ill and had difficulty breathing. The temporal temperature was 37.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 99/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 31 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

There were small pleural effusions that were larger on the left side than on the right side.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies Obtained on Current Presentation.\nDr. Ravicz: Treatment with enoxaparin, vancomycin, and cefepime was started, and intravenous fluids were administered. The patient was admitted to the second hospital. On hospital day 2, the oxygen saturation decreased, and supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula. Blood cultures showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional evaluation and treatment.\nOn admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and nausea continued. The patient reported fatigue and weight loss that had started after the injury to the chest. He had also noticed discoloration in his fingers that was associated with changes in temperature. There was no headache, abdominal pain, or joint pain.\nThe patient had a history of asthma, migraines, and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. Bipolar disorder had been diagnosed when he was hospitalized for mania, grandiose thoughts, and paranoid delusions. Medications included quetiapine, paliperidone, and methylphenidate. Sulfa drugs and valproate had caused rash, nausea, and vomiting. The patient had previously been sexually active with female partners. He drank alcohol rarely and vaped marijuana frequently; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother, maternal aunt, paternal aunt, and paternal uncle had depression.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 89/40 mm Hg, the heart rate 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The right lung was clear on auscultation, but the left lung had diminished sounds. There was no abdominal tenderness, joint swelling, or rash. The patient had a flat affect, apathy, grandiose thoughts, poverty of speech and thought, and psychomotor retardation. There was no evidence of paranoia or hallucinations. The hemoglobin level was 8.7 g per deciliter and the albumin level 1.6 g per deciliter.

Cote: A 52-year-old man with a metastatic solitary fibrous tumor was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 1.5 years before the current admission, when dysuria and pain in the lower abdomen and left leg developed after a motor vehicle accident. At another hospital, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reportedly revealed an incidental 14-cm necrotic mass in the pelvis, anterior to the bladder. Biopsy of the mass was reportedly diagnostic of a solitary fibrous tumor.\nThe patient was referred to the multidisciplinary oncology clinic of this hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed for staging, revealed two 9-mm nodules in the left lung. The patient was treated with a 3-month course of dacarbazine chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy targeting the pelvic mass, and then he underwent surgical resection of the pelvic tumor, including partial cystectomy and placement of a ureteral stent. Pathological examination of the resected specimen (Figure 1) confirmed the diagnosis of spindle-cell sarcoma with features consistent with a dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumor. Immunohistochemical staining of the resected specimen revealed signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and CD34 in the tumor cells. Stereotactic radiation therapy for the lung nodules was also administered.\nFIGURE 1\n\nSpecimen of the Resected Mass.\nHowever, metastatic disease progressed in the lungs, chest, bladder, and right leg. Over the subsequent 12-month period, the patient underwent serial treatment with four different chemotherapeutic regimens: pazopanib, doxorubicin with olaratumab, gemcitabine with docetaxel, and vinorelbine. Palliative radiation therapy for a painful leg metastasis was also provided.\nEleven days after the initiation of vinorelbine chemotherapy and 30 days before the current admission, the patient was admitted to this hospital with fever (temperature, 38.3\u00b0C), neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, 770 per microliter; reference range, 1800 to 7700), and pneumonia in the left lower lobe.\nDr. Reece J. Goiffon: CT of the chest and abdomen (Figure 2A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed known metastatic involvement of the lungs, bladder, retroperitoneum, peritoneum, skeletal muscles, and subcutaneous fat. There was no metastatic involvement of the adrenal glands, pancreas, or liver.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Cote: Empirical treatment with cefepime was administered. Over the next several days, the neutropenia and fever resolved and the pneumonia abated. On the seventh hospital day, the patient was discharged home with a follow-up visit scheduled in the oncology clinic.\nEleven days after hospital discharge and 12 days before the current admission, the patient attended a scheduled outpatient visit for an infusion. He reported weakness and appeared confused. A fingerstick glucose level was 47 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter). Supplemental oral and intravenous glucose was administered, and his mental status improved, but fingerstick glucose levels remained below 70 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter). Review of fingerstick glucose measurements obtained during the patient\u2019s recent hospitalization showed multiple levels ranging from 50 to 60 mg per deciliter (2.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter).\nThe patient was admitted to the oncology unit of this hospital for the management of hypoglycemia. Laboratory test results from the second hospital admission are shown in Table 1. While the patient was in the hospital, he began to have diaphoresis that correlated with episodes of hypoglycemia, for which he received orange juice and dextrose. On evaluation by a dietitian, he was found to be meeting anticipated caloric requirements.

Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with trabectedin was initiated, along with pegfilgrastim and a 3-day tapering course of dexamethasone. The day after the dexamethasone course was completed, the patient reported increased fatigue and cough. Two days later, he was admitted to the oncology unit because of weakness and diaphoresis; a fingerstick glucose level was 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter).\nOn the current admission, review of systems was notable for fatigue; pain associated with tumors involving the back, shoulders, and right leg; numbness of the right leg; the use of an indwelling Foley catheter for 2 months owing to urinary retention; dull chest pain and intermittent dyspnea that had persisted for 4 months; and constipation. The patient had no recent anorexia, weight change, fever, chills, orthopnea, hemoptysis, light-headedness, dizziness, palpitations, syncope, nausea, or vomiting.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for transfusion-dependent anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (for which he had received metformin, although not in the previous 6 months), hypertension, a colonic tubular adenoma, a renal cyst, osteoarthritis, chronic low-back pain, and depression. He had undergone an appendectomy in the remote past. Medications included oral gabapentin, cyanocobalamin, tamsulosin, and finasteride; transdermal fentanyl; and oral acetaminophen, clonazepam, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and oxycodone as needed. He had no access to insulin or other hypoglycemic medications. There were no known adverse drug reactions.\nThe patient had formerly worked as a laborer and had been receiving disability benefits since the motor vehicle accident. He had previously consumed six beers per week and smoked one pack of cigarettes per day, but he had stopped drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco 1 year earlier. There was no history of other substance use. His family history of cancer included melanoma in his father, thyroid cancer in his sister, ovarian cancer in his maternal grandmother, leukemia in his maternal aunt, and sarcoma in his paternal uncle. His mother had hypertension and dyslipidemia, and a brother had diabetes. The patient had an adult child, who was healthy.\nThe tympanic temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Multiple tender, palpable masses were present, including masses on the left shoulder, neck, and left upper leg. A venous-access port was in place in the chest wall on the right side. The abdominal incision was well healed. A Foley catheter was in place, and there was pink-tinged urine. A faint rash was present on the lower abdomen at the site of previous radiation therapy. Edema was present in both legs. Laboratory test results from the current hospital admission are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Goiffon: A chest radiograph (Figure 2B) showed abundant metastatic pulmonary nodules. CT of the chest (Figure 2C and 2D), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed that the nodules had increased in size and quantity over a period of 1 month. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.\nDr. Cote: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, a leftward axis, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and intraventricular conduction delay.\nOn the first hospital day, although the patient was receiving a continuous infusion of dextrose, five bolus injections of dextrose and six glasses of orange juice were needed to increase the blood glucose level to more than 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter). On the morning of the second hospital day, the blood glucose level was 42 mg per deciliter (2.3 mmol per liter).

The temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C. The volar aspect of the left wrist was erythematous and swollen, as was the left knee. Tests for Lyme disease antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Radiographs showed subcutaneous edema of the left knee but no fracture, dislocation, or evidence of advanced arthropathy of the left knee or wrist. A 10-day course of prednisone was prescribed for presumed inflammatory arthritis. The joint swelling and pain resolved.\nSix months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the same emergency department because of a painful rash. The temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C. The distal left forearm was erythematous and had scattered small subcutaneous nodules. Laboratory evaluation revealed pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and uric acid were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A plain radiograph of the left wrist showed soft-tissue edema but no abnormalities of the bone. A second course of prednisone was prescribed, and the patient was referred to a dermatologist and a gastroenterologist for consultation.\nTwo weeks later, the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had multiple tan macules on the face and trunk, angiomas, and reddish-purple papules (some >1 cm in diameter) on the left forearm. A biopsy of a papule on the left forearm was performed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed nonspecific suppurative and granulomatous dermatitis. No microorganisms were identified, and culture of the biopsy specimen was negative.\nFour months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had spider angiomas and fullness of the left upper quadrant. On a serum-based test for liver fibrosis (FibroTest), he had a score of 0.96 (with scores of 0.00 to 0.21 indicating no fibrosis and scores of 0.74 to 1.00 indicating severe fibrosis). Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. William R. Bradley: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed a nodular hepatic contour with patchy perfusion but no focal hepatic lesions (Figure 1A). Splenomegaly, portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation, and perigastric, paraesophageal, and splenorenal collateral vessels were also identified (Figure 1B and 1C). There was no dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts; the common bile duct measured 8 mm in diameter (Figure 1D).\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRCP Images.\nDr. Schaefer: Three months before the current evaluation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. Grade 2 esophageal varices were identified and banded. Eight days later, the patient was admitted to a second hospital because of new confusion, lethargy, delayed and slurred speech, and visual hallucinations. The blood ammonia level was 99 \u03bcmol per liter (169 \u03bcg per deciliter; reference range, 11 to 60 \u03bcmol per liter [19 to 102 \u03bcg per deciliter]). Urinalysis was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. Abdominal ultrasound images showed persistent splenomegaly and heterogeneous liver echotexture without ascites. A computed tomographic scan of the head, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, a pattern consistent with incomplete right bundle-branch block, downsloping ST-segment depressions in the precordium, and a prolonged corrected QT interval. Treatment with lactulose was initiated for a working diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. Confusion resolved, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day with arrangements made for additional cardiac testing after discharge.\nOne month before the current evaluation, an echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, mild right ventricular dilatation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation with right atrial dilatation, and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 71 mm Hg. Perfusion images obtained during vasodilator stress testing showed no evidence of inducible left ventricular ischemia. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation.\nIn the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported chronic dyspnea with exertion. He had no orthopnea, chest pain, or palpitations. He had consumed six beers daily for approximately 30 years but had not consumed alcohol during the previous 18 months. Three years before the current presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of dyslipidemia, with a blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 337 mg per deciliter (8.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 129 mg per deciliter [1.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter]) and a total cholesterol level of 380 mg per deciliter (9.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 155 to 199 mg per deciliter [4.0 to 5.1 mmol per liter]). He had a history of opioid use disorder, including intravenous opioids; the disorder had been in remission with the use of buprenorphine\u2013naloxone. Other medical history included depression, insomnia, and multiple knee surgeries. In addition to buprenorphine\u2013naloxone, medications included lactulose, omeprazole, and trazodone. Penicillin had caused a rash. He had worked as a laborer but was disabled and no longer working. He had smoked two cigarettes daily for 30 years. His family history included stroke in his father, diabetes in his mother, and rheumatoid arthritis in his sister.\nOn examination, the heart rate was 73 beats per minute, the blood pressure 99/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 69.9 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.9. He was alert and oriented; asterixis was present. The lung fields were clear, and there was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable hard mass in the epigastrium, a finding that indicated a probable firm caudate lobe of the liver. The knees had healed surgical scars, and there was no edema in the legs. A few spider angiomas were present on the chest. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serologic testing was negative for antinuclear antibodies and was positive for antimitochondrial antibodies, with a titer of 1:5120.\nAdditional diagnostic tests were performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Primary biliary cholangitis with portopulmonary hypertension."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Reuben A. Hendler (Psychiatry): A 37-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of fever, shortness of breath, and suicidal ideation in March 2020, during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).\nTen days before this admission, fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias developed. The symptoms did not abate after the patient took aspirin and acetaminophen. Five days before this admission, she sought evaluation at the urgent care clinic of this hospital because Covid-19 had been diagnosed in two coworkers. A test for Covid-19 was not performed because of limited test availability; tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were not performed because of a statewide shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs. The patient was instructed to quarantine at home.\nDuring the next 5 days, the patient quarantined in a room in her apartment. Her husband periodically brought food to the door of the room. The fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias persisted; new shortness of breath and anosmia developed. She had decreased appetite, and she consumed minimal food and drink.\nOne day before this admission, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, and the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and ketorolac were administered, and she was discharged home with instructions to continue to quarantine.\nOn the day of admission, the patient had dizziness while standing, as well as shortness of breath, and she returned to the urgent care clinic of this hospital. The temperature was 38.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 38 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was anxious and tearful. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and oral acetaminophen were administered. The dizziness resolved, and the fever, shortness of breath, and anxiety decreased. The patient was advised to return home to quarantine; however, she disclosed that if she were sent home, she planned to overdose on medications to die by suicide because of her anxiety and feelings of sadness and loneliness. Owing to concern about the patient\u2019s risk of harming herself, an order authorizing temporary involuntary hospitalization was implemented. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was brought to the emergency department.\nOn evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported anxiety, palpitations, and shortness of breath and noted that her anxiety and feelings of isolation and loneliness had developed during quarantine. She also reported poor sleep, decreased energy, and anhedonia. The patient described that she felt like a burden to her husband and was terrified that she would transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to her children, including her 4-year-old son, who had been born prematurely and had a congenital pulmonary condition.\nIn addition, the patient reported a 1-week history of new, recurring nightmares in which she would see herself playing with her own severed body parts; these nightmares occurred more frequently during periods of high fever. She intermittently had the sensation that someone was in the room with her while she was awake, even though she was aware that she was alone. She disclosed that, on the previous day, she had had new suicidal ideation associated with fear of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to her family and that she had taken five aspirin\u2013paracetamol\u2013caffeine pills at once. There had been no history of suicidal ideation or attempt, self-harm, or homicidal ideation.\nThe patient had a history of depression and panic attacks when she was a teenager and had been treated for less than 1 year with a medication that she could not recall; the symptoms had resolved by 19 years of age, and there had been no mental health follow-up. She also had a history of migraines, which occurred four times per week. She took aspirin, acetaminophen, and aspirin\u2013paracetamol\u2013caffeine as needed; there were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in Central America and had been living in the United States for 19 years. She lived with her husband, four children, and mother-in-law in an urban area of New England in a community that was predominantly Latinx and that had a high rate of Covid-19\u2013related infections and deaths. The patient did not complete high school while she was living in Central America and was currently employed full time in a food-production factory. She reported that she enjoyed her job but that she had been reluctant to work during the Covid-19 pandemic because of concern about becoming ill; however, she described that she felt obligated to work to support her family. The patient did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from cancer.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 148/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared well-groomed and fatigued, and she was tearful with a depressed and dysphoric mood. Her behavior was described as \u201csullen,\u201d and there was limited eye contact and reduced psychomotor activity. Her speech, in Spanish, was fluent but was slow and mumbling, with reduced prosody. She had no derailment of thought, delusions, or obsessions, but she ruminated on her nightmares. She stated that she had no current suicidal ideation but that she might attempt suicide if she had to return to her children and expose them to SARS-CoV-2 again.\nNucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the chest revealed ground-glass opacities in the right middle and lower lobes and in the left lower lobe.

She reported that jerking movements of the right arm and leg had occurred 5 minutes before her arrival at the hospital and had caused jaw dislocation; she also reported that the rash on her chest had become painful. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable. The mental-status and neurologic examinations were reportedly normal. The jaw was dislocated to the left, and there was diffuse abdominal tenderness. Intravenous morphine, diphenhydramine, and ondansetron were administered; an infusion of dextrose was started; and the dislocated jaw was manually reduced. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. The next day, the severity of pain in the abdomen and rash increased. Transfer to this hospital was requested because of a shortage of hemin at the other hospital.\nOn evaluation at this hospital, the patient described intense pain in the abdomen, a painful rash, and persistent nausea, agitation, and confusion. She was worried that she might have seizures, have blistering of the skin, or die because the hemin infusion had been delayed. Additional history was obtained from the patient. She had a history of obesity, anxiety, and chronic pain that had been attributed to acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that acute intermittent porphyria had been diagnosed 13 years before this admission, when abdominal pain, jerking movements of the right arm and leg, and a painful rash developed during menarche. During the 13 years before this admission, one or two flares of acute intermittent porphyria had occurred each year; during the 6 months before this admission, no flares had occurred.\nTwo previous flares of acute intermittent porphyria had been treated with a hemin infusion. During the first hemin infusion, the patient had a reaction that was characterized by intense yelling and writhing in pain, and intubation was performed to complete the infusion. Before the second hemin infusion, she received intravenous methylprednisolone and underwent elective intubation to prevent a reaction. The patient identified heat, stress, and menses as triggers for acute intermittent porphyria flares.\nMedications included intravenous diphenhydramine and dextrose, which were administered daily through a central-venous-access port in the right side of the chest. The patient had previously taken intravenous morphine daily; however, she had not had access to this medication for approximately 3 months because of an inability to transport it from her home in the United Kingdom. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and penicillin had caused anaphylaxis, prochlorperazine had caused flushing, metoclopramide had caused anxiety, and fentanyl had caused altered mental status.\nThe patient was born in New England and had moved to the United Kingdom 15 years earlier. She was a student in a graduate program at a university in the United Kingdom and had returned to New England to visit her family. She did not use alcohol or illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke cigarettes. Her mother had dementia, and her father had died years earlier from an unknown cause. Her maternal grandmother had acute intermittent porphyria. Her immediate family had undergone genetic testing for acute intermittent porphyria; her brother was an asymptomatic carrier of a pathogenic variant, and her six other siblings were not carriers.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 144/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared older than her stated age. She was awake, alert, and oriented. She was frustrated and irritable, with pressured speech. A port in the right side of the chest was palpated. Tenderness in the abdomen was diffuse but was worst in the right upper quadrant. Erythematous plaques and excoriations were present on the arms and chest and under the breasts. The neurologic examination was normal.\nBlood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The hemoglobin level was 10.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0) and the platelet count 120,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). A urine specimen was obtained for measurement of the urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) and porphyrin levels, but the amount of urine was inadequate. Oral acetaminophen and intravenous morphine, diphenhydramine, lorazepam, and ondansetron were administered. Infusions of dextrose and hemin were started, and the patient was admitted to this hospital.\nDuring the subsequent 2 days, the hemin infusion was continued, but the patient\u2019s symptoms did not abate. On the second hospital day, an additional urine specimen was obtained; the urinary PBG level was 0.3 \u03bcmol per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 1.3) and the uroporphyrin level 4 nmol per liter (reference range, 0 to 30). On the third hospital day, the patient reported worsening jerking movements of the right arm and leg, which she believed had caused jaw dislocation. On examination, the jaw was dislocated to the left. She did not cooperate with a manual reduction, and a surgical reduction of the jaw was performed.\nA diagnosis was made.", "ground_truth_output": "Factitious disorder."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Marisa L. Winkler: A 22-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of pain and rapidly spreading erythema of the left hand.\nThe patient had been well until the day of admission, when he awoke with pain and swelling of the left hand that involved the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger. Over a period of several hours, the pain progressed and bullae began to form. He began to have pain with movement of the second and fourth fingers, and the bullae turned dark purple; these changes prompted the patient to present to the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported pain of the left hand that worsened with movement of the second and fourth fingers. There was no lethargy, fatigue, headache, dyspnea, cough, or pain elsewhere. The patient had no notable medical history and had been well before the day of presentation.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There were two violaceous, tender bullae on the dorsal aspect of the left hand \u2014 one on the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and one on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger, each measuring 7 mm by 3 mm (Figure 1). In addition, there was nontender, streaking erythema spreading across the dorsal aspect of the left hand, the volar aspect of the left forearm, and the medial aspect of the left upper arm into the axilla. There was no axillary lymphadenopathy.\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs.\nOn further examination of the left arm, the soft-tissue compartments were soft and compressible, without evidence of crepitus. Finger flexion and extension were intact but limited by pain and swelling in the second and fourth fingers. Results of motor and sensory examinations were normal. The hand was warm. The radial pulse was palpable, and the capillary refill was brisk. The remainder of the overall physical examination was unremarkable.

There was no evidence of osseous erosion, periosteal reaction, fracture, joint effusion, fluid collection, or subcutaneous air. The left forearm had a normal appearance on imaging.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Winkler: While the patient was in the emergency department, additional history was obtained. The patient was not taking any medications and had no known allergies to medications. He had recently graduated from college and was seeking employment. He lived with his parents in a suburban area of New England. There was no history of recent travel or sick contacts. He rarely drank alcohol and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. There was no notable family history.\nThe patient had recently begun practicing taxidermy as a new hobby. Four days before presentation, he received a frozen deer hide from a friend, which he began to prepare for tanning. When he first received the deer hide, he scraped the skin and fur to remove numerous ticks. On the day before presentation, he kneaded the hide with his hands and massaged into it a mixture of deer brain and tap water that had been prepared the day before and left to stand overnight. While the patient was working with the animal hide, he did not wear protective clothing or gloves. His mother had assisted in part of the process but remained well.\nIntravenous fluid, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Consultants from the orthopedic hand service, dermatology, and infectious diseases evaluated the patient. A diagnostic test was performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae infection."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Carolina Geadas (Medicine): A 70-year-old man with a history of kidney transplantation was evaluated at this hospital because of multiple erythematous rashes that had developed during an admission for respiratory failure, pneumococcal bacteremia, and kidney failure.\nApproximately 4.5 years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013associated vasculitis after he presented with progressive glomerulonephritis with kidney failure and new hemoptysis. The anti-myeloperoxidase antibody titer was 221.0 U (reference value, <2.8). The patient underwent plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were administered. Hemodialysis was initiated. Two weeks later, rituximab was administered, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were discontinued. During the next 4 years, his renal function did not improve, and treatment with rituximab and hemodialysis was continued.\nFour months before the current admission, the patient underwent transplantation of a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C virus antibody\u2013positive status. After the kidney transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy included a dose of basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and tapering doses of prednisone. The patient had delayed graft function; the blood creatinine level decreased from approximately 4.00 mg per deciliter (354 mmol per liter) immediately after transplantation to 1.50 mg per deciliter (133 mmol per liter) 6 weeks later. Six days before the current admission, at a routine follow-up visit, the creatinine level was 1.33 mg per deciliter (118 mmol per liter).\nFour days before the current admission, the patient began to have central abdominal discomfort, nausea, anorexia, chills, and diarrhea with loose stools three times per day. During the next several days, he noticed decreased urine output and malaise, and he began to have rhinorrhea, cough, sinus congestion, and dyspnea. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems was notable for palpitations and dizziness and was negative for fever, emesis, and hematuria. The patient\u2019s brother had recently received a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for vasculitis with end-stage kidney disease (culminating in kidney transplantation), coronary artery disease (with placement of a stent in the right coronary artery), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cholelithiasis (with cholecystectomy), colonic polyps and diverticulosis, gout, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, hernia (with hernia repair), and spinal stenosis. Medications taken at home included mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, prednisone, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, valganciclovir, warfarin, aspirin, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, and cholecalciferol, as well as lorazepam as needed. Penicillin had caused anaphylaxis.\nThe patient was a retired business owner and lived with family in Boston. He had a remote history of tobacco smoking that totaled 10 pack-years; he had quit smoking approximately 40 years earlier. He did not drink alcohol or use other substances. His family history was notable for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease in his father and siblings. There was no known family history of kidney or autoimmune disease.\nThe temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/56 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air, 92% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 60 liters per minute. On examination, he appeared acutely ill and weak. He had bitemporal cachexia, dry oral mucosa, and increased work of breathing. Auscultation of the chest revealed tachypnea, diminished breath sounds and crackles in the lungs, and tachycardia. There was tenderness in the periumbilical area and the right lower quadrant, at the site of the kidney transplantation; the incision was well healed.\nBlood levels of lipase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine specimens were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed possible sinus tachycardia with right bundle-branch block. Vancomycin and cefepime were administered intravenously. Three hours after presentation, a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was positive, and remdesivir and dexamethasone were administered intravenously.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Initial Evaluation, Hospital Day 4, Hospital Day 14\n\nBlood\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 13.8, 10.1, 7.7\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 41.5, 29.8, 24.0\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 320, 9520, 3250\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l)\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 50, 8580, 3050\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 60, 80, 30\nMonocytes, 200\u20131200, 110, 580, 80\nEosinophils, 0\u2013900, \u2014, 0, 80\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 168,000, 106,000, 35,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 132, 134, 138\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 3.1, 4.8, 4.9\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 95, 101, 103\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 19, 18, 18\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 67, 31, 20\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 4.08, 1.63, 1.02\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 83, 170, 161\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 3.5, 1.8, 2.3\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 18, 190, 36\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201340, 61, 814, 46\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013115, 63, 134, 90\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 1.2, 2.8, 4.4\nDirect bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20130.4, 0.8, 2.2, 4.0\nLactate (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.2, 1.5, 2.4, 2.0\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 56.8, 21.2, 18.4\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 6.8, 1.9, 1.6\nPartial-thromboplastin time (sec), 22.0\u201336.0, \u2014, 76.8, 44.6\nTacrolimus (ng/ml), >2.0, 29.9, 13.1, 3.2\nHigh-sensitivity troponin T (ng/liter), 0\u20139, 105, \u2014, \u2014\nN-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (pg/ml), <900, 63,959, \u2014, \u2014\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), 0.0\u20138.0, 120.4, \u2014, \u2014\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), 20\u2013300, 4261, \u2014, \u2014\nD-dimer (ng/ml), <500, \u2014, 916, \u2014\n\nArterial blood gas\nFraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, \u2014, 0.30, 0.55\npH, 7.35\u20137.45, \u2014, 7.38, 7.31\nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 35\u201342, \u2014, 31, 40\nPartial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 80\u2013100, \u2014, 80, 65\n\nUrine\nColor, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, \u2014\nClarity, Clear, Turbid, Slightly cloudy, \u2014\npH, 5.0\u20139.0, 5.5, 6.0, \u2014\nSpecific gravity, 1.001\u20131.035, 1.019, 1.020, \u2014\nGlucose, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nKetones, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nLeukocyte esterase, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nNitrite, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nBlood, Negative, 2+, 3+, \u2014\nProtein, Negative, 2+, 2+, \u2014\nErythrocytes (per high-power field), 0\u20132, 10\u201320, 20\u201350, \u2014\nLeukocytes (per high-power field), <10, 0, 10\u201320, \u2014\nBacteria, None, 1+, 2+, \u2014\n\nDr. Joseph D. King: Radiography of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed confluent basilar consolidation in the left lung and scattered patchy opacities in the right lung. Ultrasonography that targeted the renal allograft revealed normal renal parenchyma and a trace amount of adjacent free fluid. Doppler ultrasonography (Figure 1B through 1E) showed patent vasculature with normal flow velocities but showed elevated renal arterial resistive indexes, which are suggestive of allograft dysfunction. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1F and 1G), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed confluent consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs, with more extensive findings in the left lung than in the right lung, as well as patchy multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of both lungs and the middle lobe of the right lung. Concurrent CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1H), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was remarkable for only a trace amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant, along the renal allograft.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Geadas: The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital. Phenylephrine was administered intravenously. He could not be weaned from the high-flow nasal cannula; because he had increased work of breathing and tachypnea, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation initiated. Bronchoscopy revealed dark secretions in the lower lobe and lingula of the left lung. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae in four of four bottles. A blood test for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative, and serum levels of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan and galactomannan were undetectable. Azithromycin, cefepime, linezolid, amiodarone, furosemide, and vitamin K were administered intravenously, and valganciclovir and atovaquone were administered orally. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed low-normal ventricular function, atrial enlargement, and no valvular vegetations. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated. ANCA titers were undetectable.\nOn hospital day 3, excoriation and erythema of the buttock and a purpuric plaque on the sacrum were noted (Figure 2A). Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no changes. Punch biopsy of skin on the right buttock was performed. The antibiotic regimen was transitioned to intravenous ceftriaxone.\nFIGURE 2\n\nClinical Photographs.\nThe following day, histologic examination of the skin-biopsy specimen revealed epidermal necrosis, with scattered apoptotic and necrotic keratinocytes and extravasated erythrocytes. No microorganisms were identified, and microbiologic culture of the biopsy specimen was negative. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 4 are shown in Table 1.\nDuring the next 6 days, treatment with continuous venovenous hemofiltration and intravenous ceftriaxone was continued. The level of mechanical ventilation was reduced from mandatory provided breaths to spontaneous ventilation, and the mode was switched to pressure-support ventilation. Repeat blood cultures were negative. On hospital day 11, the patient\u2019s respiratory status worsened; the fraction of inspired oxygen was increased, and a mandatory respiratory rate was reinstituted.\nTwo days later, a new well-circumscribed purpuric patch was noted on the abdomen (Figure 2B). The patch measured 5 cm in greatest dimension and had a hyperpigmented halo but had no fluctuance or crepitus. The next day, a similar-appearing lesion was noted on the right thigh. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 14 are shown in Table 1.\nDr. King: Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed increased consolidative and ground-glass opacities in both lungs.\nDr. Geadas: Ceftriaxone was discontinued, and vancomycin, cefepime, and liposomal amphotericin B were administered intravenously.

Liu (Neurology): A 58-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of progressively worsening confusion and evolving changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 16 months before the current presentation, when confusion and expressive and auditory aphasia developed. She was evaluated at another hospital. The findings of computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck were reportedly normal. MRI of the head reportedly showed signal hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed elevated levels of glucose and protein with a normal cell count; nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus DNA was negative. Blood and CSF paraneoplastic autoantibody and autoimmune encephalopathy panels were unrevealing. The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Screening tests for syphilis and antinuclear antibodies were negative. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized slowing, with no epileptiform discharges. A diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis was considered, and treatment included intravenous glucocorticoids for 5 days, followed by treatment with daily oral prednisone. Expressive aphasia resolved and confusion abated, but auditory aphasia persisted.\nCT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a mass measuring 5 cm in diameter in the pelvis that was composed of fat, soft tissue, and calcifications. Laparotomy was performed, and pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with a mature cystic teratoma. The patient was discharged home after a 3-week hospitalization, with a plan to taper the dose of oral prednisone after discharge.\nOne week after the patient\u2019s discharge from the other hospital, after the dose of prednisone had been decreased, malaise developed and confusion recurred. The patient was readmitted to the other hospital. MRI of the head reportedly showed a decrease in the left temporal lobe hyperintensities relative to the previous imaging study. The dose of prednisone was increased, confusion again abated, and the patient was discharged home. The dose of glucocorticoids was gradually tapered.\nSix months before the current presentation, confusion recurred, and the patient was readmitted to the other hospital. Imaging studies were performed.\nDr. Otto Rapalino: MRI of the head reportedly showed progression of the signal hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe on T2-weighted FLAIR images.\nDr. Liu: A diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis was again considered. Treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids was reinitiated, which resulted in some reduction in confusion. The patient was discharged home with instructions to continue oral prednisone therapy, with a plan to again gradually taper the dose.\nThree months before the current presentation, confusion recurred. The patient was again admitted to the other hospital, and imaging studies were repeated.\nDr. Rapalino: MRI of the head reportedly showed progression of the hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe and new signal hyperintensities in the right temporal and left occipital lobes.\nDr. Liu: Treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab was initiated. The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility, with a plan for weekly rituximab infusions for 5 weeks and a 6-week tapering course of daily oral prednisone therapy. Confusion resolved and did not recur.\nDr. Rapalino: Three weeks before the current presentation, MRI of the head, which was performed to evaluate the response to immunosuppressive medications, reportedly showed hyperintensity in both temporal lobes, with extension to the anterior aspects of the parietal lobes, on T2-weighted FLAIR images. Enhancement involving the subinsular regions was present, along with restricted diffusion in the insular cortexes. Positron-emission tomography (PET)\u2013CT of the skull base to the midthighs reportedly showed no abnormalities.\nDr. Liu: Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by her neurologist in the clinic, who recommended admission to the hospital for additional treatment owing to the progressively worsening findings on head imaging. One week before the current presentation, she was admitted to the other hospital. Treatment included daily intravenous immunoglobulin for 5 days and mycophenolate mofetil. On the third hospital day, she fell and struck her forehead while walking to the bathroom. On the sixth hospital day, she was transferred to this hospital to potentially undergo a brain biopsy.\nOn arrival at this hospital, the patient reported pain on her forehead where she had struck her head during her fall. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sensorineural hearing loss (which had been diagnosed when she was 45 years of age), and depression. The results of a routine screening colonoscopy that had been performed 4 years before the current presentation had been normal. In additional to mycophenolate mofetil and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, medications included ascorbic acid, cholecalciferol, glipizide, magnesium oxide, metoprolol, omeprazole, sertraline, and thiamine. Treatment with metformin had been stopped at the other hospital because the blood level of lactate had been 12.4 mmol per liter (112 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18 mg per deciliter]) on presentation. There were no known drug allergies. She had worked in health care until the onset of neurologic symptoms 16 months earlier. Before being discharged to the skilled nursing facility, she had lived alone. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had diabetes and had died from heart disease at 59 years of age; she had used hearing aids. Her father had died from heart disease at 78 years of age. Both her brothers had diabetes, along with hearing loss in both ears.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 154/90 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 157.5 cm, the weight 34 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 13.7. Ecchymoses and a healing laceration were present on the right side of the forehead. The patient had receptive aphasia, which severely limited her ability to understand oral speech, but she could comprehend written or typed questions. She was alert and interactive and oriented to person, place, and time. Her speech was fluent, with no paraphasic errors. She was able to follow simple and complex commands without difficulty. Concentration and attention were intact. No abnormalities involving the cranial nerves were noted, with the exception of anisocoria; the left pupil measured 5 mm in diameter, and the right pupil measured 3 mm in diameter. Both pupils were reactive to light. The muscle bulk was decreased, but muscle tone and strength were normal. Tests of sensation, deep-tendon reflexes, and cerebellar function showed normal results.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The blood level of lactate was 2.6 mmol per liter. The complete blood count with differential count was normal, except for the level of hemoglobin (11.3 g per deciliter; reference range, 12.0 to 16.0).\nDiagnostic tests were performed.", "ground_truth_output": "MIDD (maternally inherited diabetes and deafness) and MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes) associated with the m.3243A\u2192G pathogenic variant."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Emma C. Materne (Pediatrics): A 12-month-old boy with Hirschsprung\u2019s disease was admitted to this hospital because of fever.\nFifteen days before the current admission, the patient had a temperature of 39.7\u00b0C. His parents noticed that he was fussy and less active than usual and that he had a decreased appetite along with several episodes of \u201cspitting up\u201d; there was no vomiting or diarrhea. During the next 5 days, fever occurred daily and abated with the administration of acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Ten days before the current admission, a bowel movement with watery, nonbloody, foul-smelling, mustard-yellow stool occurred. The patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the patient was irritable. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There were well-circumscribed, erythematous, edematous plaques on the abdomen, legs, feet, and forearms. The alanine aminotransferase level was 131 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the aspartate aminotransferase level 250 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 80), the ferritin level 3826 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 30 to 300), and the d-dimer level 3218 ng per milliliter (reference range, <500). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 40 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 15); the white-cell count was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A radiograph of the abdomen showed gas-filled loops of bowel. The rectum was irrigated, and intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered. On the third hospital day, the patient was afebrile and able to take formula, and the diarrhea abated.

However, 4 days before the current admission, a day-care worker observed that the patient appeared tired. During the subsequent 3 days at home, fever again developed, with chills and a decreased appetite. The day before the current admission, the patient cried through the night. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nThe parents reported that the patient was fussy and had poor sleep and generalized weakness; there was no diarrhea or new rash. The parents did not think that the patient was in pain. Additional history was obtained from the parents. The patient had met developmental milestones until 1 month earlier, when he had stopped crawling. He had previously been able to pull his body into a standing position, but he no longer attempted this maneuver. If he was placed in a standing position, he collapsed; if he was placed in a sitting position, he was able to stay upright. He had previously passed objects from hand to hand, but he had a new preference of holding objects with the left hand. Two days before this evaluation, the parents had noticed that the patient no longer walked with support; he seemed to dislike having his hands held.\nThe patient had cornea plana and a history of Hirschsprung\u2019s disease, for which he had undergone laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and an anal pull-through procedure at 2 months of age. Four months before the current evaluation, an intermittent diffuse rash on the trunk, arms, and legs had developed. The rash was characterized by purplish and pinkish plaques that appeared and varied in intensity of color throughout the day; it did not seem to be itchy or painful and usually resolved within 24 hours without treatment.\nImmunizations were up to date. Medications included metronidazole, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and cetirizine, as well as carboxymethylcellulose eye drops; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient lived with his mother, father, and pet dog in a small town in New England, and he attended day care 5 days per week. His mother was healthy, and his father had irritable bowel syndrome and Poland syndrome (congenital aplasia of unilateral chest-wall muscles). His paternal grandmother had hypothyroidism, his maternal great-grandfather had had pancreatic cancer, his paternal great-grandfather had had breast cancer, a maternal second cousin had autism, and multiple maternal family members had Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 113/52 mm Hg, the heart rate 166 beats per minute (normal range for age, 80 to 160), and the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute (normal range for age, 30 to 60). The patient was diaphoretic and irritable, and he cried during the examination. He had rhinorrhea. The abdomen was not distended or tender. There was limited extension of the wrists and knees, as well as limited inversion and eversion of the feet. The ankles were mildly stiff, and the feet were mildly swollen. There were erythematous plaques on the abdomen, back, arms, and legs (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nClinical Photographs.\nThe ferritin and d-dimer levels remained elevated, and the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were normal.

Blood cultures and urinalysis were normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Randheer Shailam: A radiograph of the chest and abdomen was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed cholelithiasis and prominent lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed a small amount of joint fluid in the hips and knees (Figure 2); the amount of fluid appeared to be within the normal range. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder, without gallbladder distention. There were a few prominent lymph nodes in the paraaortic, iliac, and inguinal regions (Figure 2). Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal coronary arteries.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Materne: The empirical administration of intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was begun. During the next 3 days, the fever continued and the white-cell count remained elevated.
