[{"user_input": "Dr. Mubeen A. Shakir (Medicine): A 50-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of pain in the left upper quadrant and hypoxemia.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 year before this admission, when fatigue and weight loss developed and she had abnormal results on liver-function tests after undergoing cholecystectomy for presumed acalculous cholecystitis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, which was performed as part of the evaluation to determine the cause of the abnormal liver-function test results, revealed hepatosplenomegaly (Figure 1A).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies Obtained before Admission.\nSeven months before this admission, a submandibular mass and swelling developed; 1 month later, examination of a biopsy specimen of the mass revealed granulomatous sialadenitis. A liver biopsy was performed to investigate the patient\u2019s abdominal distention, poor appetite, and persistently abnormal liver-function test results, which were suggestive of cholestasis. The liver-biopsy specimen showed evidence of granulomatous hepatitis; portal and periportal nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation that was associated with multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, and some plasma cells; and stage 1 to 2 (portal and periportal) fibrosis. Special stains for organisms (acid-fast and Grocott methenamine\u2013silver stains) were negative.\nCT of the chest revealed minimal bibasilar atelectasis and a trace left pleural effusion. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Tests for histoplasma species, blastomyces species, cryptococcus species, coccidioides species, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses were all negative, as was testing for antinuclear antibodies, antimitochondrial antibodies, and anti\u2013smooth muscle antibodies. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made on the basis of the biopsy results of the submandibular gland and liver and the presence of hypercalcemia and an elevated angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme level.\nFour months before this admission, prednisone therapy was initiated at a dose of 40 mg per day; subsequently, there was a marked reduction in the patient\u2019s abdominal distention and marked improvement in her appetite. Liver-function test results also improved. Methotrexate therapy was started at a dose of 15 mg per week, with plans to taper the dose of prednisone.\nThree months before this admission, the patient stopped prednisone therapy because of irritability and insomnia. One month later, routine monitoring of the patient\u2019s liver function revealed worsening liver-function test results in a cholestatic pattern. This finding was attributed to undertreatment of sarcoidosis, but the patient declined to restart prednisone; the dose of methotrexate was increased to 25 mg per week.\nDuring the next month, the patient noted fatigue, slowly progressive dyspnea on exertion, and cough, without fever or chills. She was evaluated by her primary care physician 1 month before this admission, and a chest radiograph showed bilateral, perihilar, diffuse, symmetric ground-glass opacities with scattered patchy opacities at the lung bases (Figure 1B and 1C). Levofloxacin was administered.\nThree weeks before this admission, CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed worsening hepatosplenomegaly. Prednisone therapy was started at a dose of 20 mg per day.\nOn the morning of admission, the patient was awakened from sleep by severe, sharp pain in the left upper quadrant. The pain was not worse with eating, and she reported no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Because of persistent pain throughout the day, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported progressive dyspnea on exertion and being unable to climb stairs in her home. There was no chest pain, edema in the legs, weight gain, or orthopnea. She had a cough that was productive of clear sputum but had no fevers or chills.\nThe patient had a history of preeclampsia, Helicobacter pylori infection, cholecystectomy, and papillary thyroid cancer for which she had undergone hemithyroidectomy 9 years before this admission. In addition to methotrexate and prednisone, her medications included omeprazole and trazodone. Her father had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and one son had ulcerative colitis. Both maternal grandparents had had tuberculosis, but the patient had not had contact with them; her mother had latent tuberculosis. The patient had no known drug allergies. She worked as an administrative assistant and lived with her husband and children in a suburb of Boston. She had never smoked tobacco, did not use illicit drugs, and previously drank one glass of wine per week before her diagnosis of sarcoidosis. She had not traveled outside the United States in the past 5 years.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 112/56 mm Hg, the pulse 128 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21. The patient was awake and alert but appeared fatigued. The first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) were normal, without murmurs; the jugular venous pressure, which was measured from the approximate midpoint of the right atrium, was 6 cm of water. Crackles were present in the middle and lower lung fields bilaterally. Normal bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft and nondistended, with tenderness in the left upper quadrant. The liver edge was palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin; the spleen tip was also palpable. There was no edema in the legs. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 93%.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The level of alanine aminotransferase was 38 IU per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin were normal. The blood level of alkaline phosphatase was 268 IU per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila antigens were not detected in the urine. The blood level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nHematocrit (%), 36\u201346, 35.3\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 12\u201316, 11.1\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 16,890\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 8280\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 7430\nMonocytes, 200\u20131200, 840\nEosinophils, 0\u2013900, 170\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 183,000\nMean corpuscular volume (fl), 80\u2013100, 90.3\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 14.8\nProthrombin-time international normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.2\nD-dimer (ng/ml), <500, 2897\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/liter), 110\u2013210, 338\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), <8, 94.6\n\nDr. Victorine V. Muse: CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hepatosplenomegaly with a hypodense wedge-shaped region in the midpole of the spleen. A portable anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure 2C) showed progressive coalescing consolidations in the middle and lower lobes with diffuse ground-glass opacities. CT of the chest (Figure 2D), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy and confirmed the presence of multifocal confluent areas of airspace consolidation, with a background of diffuse ground-glass opacities. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism or pleural effusions.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImaging Studies Obtained on Admission.\nDr. Shakir: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with prednisone, methotrexate, and omeprazole was stopped, and trazodone was continued. On hospital day 2, the temperature rose to 39.1\u00b0C, the respiratory rate increased to 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. Supplemental oxygen was increased to a rate of 5 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 93%. Cultures of the blood were obtained.\nA diagnostic test was performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Neil D. Fernandes (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\nThe patient had been well until 17 months before this admission, when he began to have episodes of headache and neck pain multiple times per week after an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) accident. Two months later, the patient collided with another adolescent while he was playing soccer, and the episodes of headache and neck pain worsened. He rated the pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain.\nFifteen months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the pediatric clinic of another hospital. On examination, the pulse was 95 beats per minute and the blood pressure 117/78 mm Hg. There was mild tenderness in the area of the trapezius muscle. A radiograph of the cervical spine was normal. During the next 15 months, the patient was followed in the pediatric and neurology clinics of the other hospital. Ibuprofen, nortriptyline, sumatriptan, cyclobenzaprine, and diazepam were prescribed, but the headache did not abate. He underwent physical therapy, chiropractic adjustment, massage therapy, and acupuncture, but the symptoms persisted.\nThree months before this admission, nausea began to occur during the episodes of headache. The pain became more intense when the patient was lying down or was physically active, resulting in tunnel vision and vomiting; after he vomited, the pain became less intense. He was evaluated at the pediatric clinic of the other hospital. On examination, the pulse was 104 beats per minute and the blood pressure 128/80 mm Hg. At the recommendation of his physicians, the patient stopped participating in all sports.\nTwo days before this admission, the pain worsened and awoke the patient from sleep. The nausea was constant, and the vomiting occurred two times per day. The patient was unable to attend school because of the symptoms. His parents took him to the pediatric clinic of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 115 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 120/64 mm Hg. The height was 183.6 cm, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.0. The physical examination was normal. A probable diagnosis of mixed migraines and tension headaches was made. Prednisone, zolmitriptan, and ondansetron were prescribed, and the patient was sent home.\nOn the day of this admission, the patient had new severe pain on the right side of the abdomen that awoke him from sleep. The headache, neck pain, and nausea were constant. The patient was taken to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the blood pressure 239/162 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The white-cell count was 22,380 per microliter (reference range at other hospital, 3800 to 10,500), the lactic acid level 2.7 mmol per liter (24 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]), and the creatinine level 1.3 mg per deciliter (115 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [53 to 115 \u03bcmol per liter]). An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with increased R-wave and S-wave amplitudes in the precordial leads, as well as nonspecific repolarization abnormalities. One hour later, a repeat ECG showed an ectopic atrial rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions at a rate of 66 beats per minute.\nIntravenous hydromorphone, morphine, ondansetron, metoclopramide, and lactated Ringer\u2019s solution were administered. A nitroglycerin infusion was started, and the systolic blood pressure decreased to 143 mm Hg; the infusion was stopped, and the systolic blood pressure increased to 212 mm Hg. Intravenous labetalol was administered, and the systolic blood pressure decreased to 92 mm Hg. An esmolol infusion was started, and the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital, arriving 3 hours after presentation to the other hospital. Shortly after his arrival, the esmolol infusion was stopped.\nOn admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had played paintball a few days earlier but did not recall any direct trauma to the chest or abdomen. A review of systems was notable for heat intolerance and night sweats. He had a history of acne and had received a diagnosis of pneumonia involving the right upper lobe 10 months before this admission. He had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccines. His medications included doxycycline and topical tretinoin, clindamycin, and benzoyl peroxide, in addition to zolmitriptan and ondansetron; he had not started taking the recently prescribed prednisone. There were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents and younger brother. He performed well in high school. Before the recent progression of his symptoms, he had participated in soccer, basketball, and track. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He drank one or two alcoholic beverages per month. His father and paternal grandparents had hypertension, and his maternal aunts had migraines; his mother and brother were healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the pulse 126 beats per minute, the blood pressure 90/44 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He appeared tired, pale, and diaphoretic. He was in distress because of the pain; he spoke in brief sentences and had frequent hiccups. The abdomen was nondistended with marked tenderness in the right upper quadrant and right flank, with rebound and guarding. The skin was warm and clammy, and some inguinal hyperpigmentation was present. No caf\u00e9 au lait spots were noted.\nThe white-cell count was 27,140 per microliter (reference range at this hospital, 4500 to 13,000), the lactic acid level 3.4 mmol per liter (31 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]), the creatinine level 1.64 mg per deciliter (145 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the high-sensitivity troponin T level 188 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On hospital day 2, urinalysis revealed 1+ blood, trace ketones, a pH of 5.0, and a specific gravity of 1.015; microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed squamous cells, crystals, and mucin, as well as 3 to 5 hyaline casts per high-power field, less than 10 white cells per high-power field, and no red cells.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (This Hospital), On Admission (This Hospital)\n\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201313,000, 27,140\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l):\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20138100, 22,820\nLymphocytes, 1200\u20135200, 2330\nMonocytes, 200\u20131400, 1210\nEosinophils, 0\u20131000, 110\nBasophils, 0\u2013400, 550\n\nHematocrit (%), 37.0\u201349.0, 40.4  \nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.0\u201316.0, 13.0  \nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013450,000, 278,000  \nLactic acid (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.0, 3.4  \nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 135  \nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 4.9  \nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 99  \nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 20  \nAnion gap (mmol/liter), 3\u201317, 16  \nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 21  \nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 1.64  \nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 241  \nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201340, 23  \nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 22  \nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 82\u2013331, 93  \nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 0.9  \n\nProtein (g/dl):\nTotal, 6.0\u20138.3, 6.1  \nAlbumin, 3.3\u20135.0, 3.6  \nGlobulin, 1.9\u20134.1, 2.5  \n\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 8.9  \nHigh-sensitivity troponin T (ng/liter), 0\u201314, 188\n\nA diagnosis was made.", "ground_truth_output": "Pheochromocytoma."}, {"user_input": "Dr. George A. Alba: A 57-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of persistent cough and pulmonary opacities.\nSix years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa after fevers, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and testicular pain had developed. He was treated with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance therapy with prednisone and weekly methotrexate. He was treated intermittently with escalating doses of prednisone because of episodic worsening of the arthralgias; the most recent such treatment was given 5 months before the current admission. At that time, owing to an exacerbation of pain associated with the arthralgias and at the direction of his physician, he increased the amount of oxycodone he had been taking. He also reported fever and weight loss. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Jeanna M. Harvey Barnes: Five months before the current admission, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Chest CT (Figure 1A and 1B) revealed mild centrilobular emphysema and small pulmonary nodules that appeared unchanged from those seen on imaging that had been performed 6 years earlier. There was also diffuse thickening of the bronchial wall, layering secretions in the trachea and right main-stem bronchus, a mildly patulous esophagus, and a small hiatal hernia. There were no clinically significant findings on imaging of the abdomen or pelvis.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies of the Chest.\nDr. Alba: A test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal, as was the IgG level.\nThree months before the current admission, the patient had fevers and a cough productive of green sputum. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air. Thrush was present in the oropharynx. Auscultation of the chest revealed crackles and wheezing in the right lung.

A blood test for cryptococcal antigen and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and Candida albicans; a test for Pneumocystis jirovecii was negative. During the next several days, fever resolved and the oxygen saturation and white-cell count normalized. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home to complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin. After he completed the course of levofloxacin, his cough and constitutional symptoms abated partially but did not return to baseline. His primary care physician prescribed inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol and as-needed inhaled albuterol.\nSix weeks after the patient was discharged from this hospital (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission), his wife began to have a nonproductive cough and rhinorrhea; several days later, the patient had similar symptoms, along with increased production of brown sputum. He sought medical attention after awakening with coughing and dyspnea. The temperature was 38.4\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 1D) obtained 1 month before the current admission showed patchy opacities in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes.\nDr. Alba: Electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin; oral prednisone; and inhaled albuterol and ipratropium was administered. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. After two days, the patient was discharged home to complete a 7-day course of levofloxacin.\nOver the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient had malaise, productive cough, fever, and sweats. He stopped smoking cigarettes.\nEight days before the current admission, the patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. There were crackles in both lung bases and in the right middle lung field, with no wheezes. Blood levels of electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2A) showed multifocal reticulonodular and patchy opacities, which were confluent in the right lower lobe. CT of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal clustered, centrilobular nodules and opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern with scattered areas of focal consolidation that were present predominantly in the right middle and lower lobes. There was associated mild mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy that had not been present on the previous chest CT examination.\nFIGURE 2\n\nSubsequent Imaging Studies of the Chest.\nDr. Alba: The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and additional testing was performed. Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies were negative, and blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal. A urine test for legionella antigen was negative.\nOn the third hospital day, a bronchoscopy and a transbronchial biopsy were performed. The bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from the right middle lobe was cloudy; analysis of the fluid revealed 888 nucleated cells per microliter (of which 48% were neutrophils and 2% were lymphocytes, with no eosinophils). Gram\u2019s staining of the BAL fluid revealed neutrophils and sparse growth of gram-positive cocci. Staining for acid-fast organisms was negative; culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. Tests of the BAL fluid for influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, P. jirovecii, histoplasma antigen, and blastomyces antigen were negative, as were cultures for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for M. tuberculosis was also negative. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day, with follow-up scheduled in the pulmonary clinic for 3 weeks later.\nFour days after the patient was discharged, a BAL test for galactomannan returned a positive result (antigen index, \u22653.750; negative test, <0.5), and the patient was readmitted to this hospital. He reported ongoing dyspnea, cough with thick white sputum, and persistent fever with a temperature of up to 39.3\u00b0C. A review of systems was notable for diffuse chronic arthralgias, a bitter taste in the mouth, and intermittent dysphagia. There was no chest pain, edema, orthopnea, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, or rash, and he had no known current sick contacts. The weight was 5 kg lower than that recorded 1 year earlier.\nMedical history was notable for polyarteritis nodosa, deep venous thrombosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pancreatitis in the context of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, osteopenia, and chronic neuropathic pain. Medications included aspirin, prednisone, methotrexate, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, folate supplementation, metformin, atenolol, simvastatin, pregabalin, and as-needed oxycodone, as well as inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol and albuterol as needed. Lisinopril had reportedly caused pancreatic inflammation; there were no other known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was of White European ancestry. He lived in New England with his wife and was retired from an office position. Three decades earlier, he had worked in a machine shop where solvents, fuels, and sulfur compounds were used but had had no known exposure to these agents. There was no history of exposure to mold, pets, or asbestos. He had received influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. He and his wife had traveled within the United States and to the Caribbean. He had smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit in the weeks before the current admission. He had previously smoked marijuana, rarely consumed alcohol, and never used other substances. There was no family history of autoimmune or pulmonary disease; his father had died from colorectal cancer, and his mother had had esophageal cancer and had died after a stroke. His three adult children were healthy.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/69 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. He had a slightly cushingoid appearance and was tachypneic, although he was able to speak in full sentences. Auscultation of the chest revealed rales at the right lung base, rhonchi during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases that were more pronounced in the right lung than in the left lung, and intermittent inspiratory wheezing in the right lung. The rest of the examination was normal.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2D) showed progression of the diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities, with additional patchy opacities in the right lung and left lower lobe, as compared with the image obtained 1 week earlier.\nDr. Alba: Blood levels of electrolytes, amylase, lipase, N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney and liver function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal, and a urine test for legionella antigen was negative.\nThe BAL-fluid culture obtained during the previous admission grew enterococcus species, C. albicans, and C. glabrata; no mycobacteria grew in any of three induced sputum samples obtained during the previous admission. Empirical treatment with intravenous voriconazole was initiated, and ongoing treatment with methotrexate was interrupted.\nCytologic analysis of the BAL fluid and the transbronchial-biopsy specimen obtained during the previous admission revealed evidence of acute inflammation, bronchial columnar cells, and pulmonary macrophages. There were no malignant cells. Evaluation of the bronchial mucosa revealed no abnormalities.\nOn the second hospital day, the temperature was 37.9\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: Repeat CT of the chest (Figure 2E and 2F) was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary embolism protocol. This imaging study revealed extensive centrilobular pulmonary nodules, opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern, and patchy ground-glass opacities. There was bronchial wall thickening with mucus plugging, predominantly affecting the lower lobes. There were additional areas of nodular consolidation that were more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung. These findings indicated a progression of disease as compared with the chest CT performed 1 week before the current admission. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.\nDr. Alba: Additional induced sputum samples were obtained for culture; Gram\u2019s staining revealed abundant neutrophils and abundant mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.\nOn the third hospital day, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute.\nDiagnostic tests were performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Aspiration pneumonia."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Erin E. Mauney (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea.\nThe patient had been well until 5 weeks before this admission, when diarrhea and intermittent, diffuse, crampy abdominal pain developed. During the subsequent week, the diarrhea occurred more frequently, and the abdominal pain worsened in severity, such that it sometimes awoke the patient from sleep. Four weeks before this admission, the diarrhea began to contain dark-red blood. The patient\u2019s mother took her to the primary care clinic of another hospital.\nIn the primary care clinic, the weight was 98.7 kg; the physical examination was otherwise normal. The hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Stool cultures for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were negative, as were antigen tests for giardia, cryptosporidium, and Clostridioides difficile toxin. Empirical treatment with ciprofloxacin was started.\nDuring the next 3 weeks, the patient completed the course of ciprofloxacin as instructed, but the abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea continued. On the day of this admission, diarrhea occurred at least four times. The patient\u2019s parents called the primary care clinic and were instructed to bring her to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported fatigue, malaise, weight loss, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea and vomiting when she ate food. She also had headache and mild, diffuse joint and muscle pain. She had had no fever or sick contacts.\nThe patient had obesity, anxiety, and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Medications included fluoxetine and dextroamphetamine\u2013amphetamine; there were no known drug allergies. Menarche had occurred when she was 11 years of age, and her last menstrual period had been 2 months earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke tobacco. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her mother, father, and sister, as well as her pet dog, cat, and lizard. She attended a technical high school with an emphasis on agriculture, and she had frequent interactions with marine and farm animals through school. Her family history included colorectal cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in her maternal grandfather, diverticulosis in her maternal grandmother and mother, psoriasis in her maternal grandmother and uncle, and celiac disease in her paternal cousin. Her father had hyperlipidemia, and her mother had had one miscarriage, which had occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 94/68 mm Hg.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed.\nDr. Maureen M. Leonard: On EGD, two cratered esophageal ulcers were located 30 cm from the incisors (Figure 1A). The proximal, middle, and distal portions of the esophagus were normal. Diffuse mild inflammation \u2014 characterized by erythema and friability \u2014 was found in the cardia, gastric fundus, and gastric antrum (Figure 1B). The duodenum appeared normal. Biopsy specimens were obtained throughout the procedure for histologic evaluation.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImages Obtained during Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and Colonoscopy.\nWhen the patient was being positioned on the procedure table for the colonoscopy, a large volume of bright-red blood was noted to be draining from the rectum. Perianal and digital rectal examinations did not reveal a source of bleeding. Emergency radiography of the abdomen did not reveal free air, and the colonoscopy was started. On colonoscopy, the rectum and proximal sigmoid colon appeared normal (Figure 1C). However, as the colonoscope was advanced farther into the sigmoid colon, multiple nonobstructing, large, friable, dark-violet lesions were identified and biopsied (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F). Because of narrowing and severe friability, the area was not traversed with the endoscope, and the procedure was aborted.\nDr. Mauney: The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of this hospital. During the subsequent 2 days, an additional two units of packed red cells were transfused. Treatment with pantoprazole was started.\nDr. Sjirk J. Westra: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and chest was performed (Figure 2A through 2D). There was irregular thickening of the large bowel wall and adjacent fat stranding, with sparing of the distal sigmoid colon and rectum. The kidneys had multifocal patchy areas of hypoattenuation.\nFIGURE 2\n\nInitial Imaging Studies.\nDr. Mauney: On hospital day 5, tachycardia and tachypnea developed. The hemoglobin level was 8.8 g per deciliter, and the platelet count was 67,000 per microliter.

On the morning of admission, he noted an abrupt onset of shortness of breath at rest and dyspnea on exertion. There was also substernal chest pain on the left side that worsened with deep breaths and when he lay down. The patient\u2019s son called emergency medical services, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the patient described ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath. The son reported that the patient had fallen at home 2 days before admission, but the patient did not remember falling and the son was not able to provide details about the nature or circumstances of the fall. The patient reported no pain in his abdomen, arms, legs, or groin and no headache.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension.

Sparger: A newborn girl was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of this hospital after a planned delivery by cesarean section because of a neck mass.\nDuring pregnancy, the patient\u2019s mother was 41 years old (gravida 3, para 1) and received prenatal care at another hospital. At 7 weeks of gestation, vaginal bleeding occurred because of a subchorionic hematoma. At 10 weeks of gestation, the mother\u2019s blood thyrotropin level was 0.01 \u03bcU per milliliter (reference range, 0.40 to 5.00); levels of free thyroxine (free T4) and total triiodothyronine (total T3) were not obtained. At 19 weeks of gestation, the thyrotropin level was 0.44 \u03bcU per milliliter and an ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy was normal. During the third trimester, gestational diabetes was diagnosed; glycemic control was maintained with dietary changes.\nFour weeks before delivery, at 34 weeks 6 days of gestation, a routine transvaginal ultrasonographic survey of fetal growth revealed a new mass on the right side of the fetus\u2019s neck that measured 2.6 cm by 3.4 cm by 3.0 cm. The mother was referred to the obstetrics clinic of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nDr. Randheer Shailam: At 35 weeks 6 days of gestation, obstetrical ultrasonography performed at this hospital (Figure 1A) confirmed the presence of a 4.6-cm mass on the right side of the neck. The mass was hyperechoic and well circumscribed and had internal vascularity; the remainder of the survey of fetal anatomy was normal.

The mother met with providers from Maternal\u2013Fetal Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Otolaryngology, and Neonatology to discuss the plan for delivery and neonatal airway management at birth, including the possibility of an ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure. The mother initially had a preference for a vaginal delivery, given her history of a successful vaginal delivery with a previous pregnancy. However, after conversations with Maternal\u2013Fetal Medicine providers, the decision was made to proceed with a scheduled cesarean section at 39 weeks of gestation to minimize the risks of labor dystocia and asynclitism due to fetal neck position and any associated birth trauma, as well as to allow for controlled timing of the delivery with multidisciplinary team members present.\nThe mother had a history of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and known mutations in both copies of the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Eleven years earlier, her first pregnancy had ended at full term with a vaginal delivery. Three years earlier, her second pregnancy had ended at 13 weeks of gestation with elective termination because of the diagnosis of pentalogy of Cantrell (a syndrome of midline abdominal and chest wall defects, including ectopia cordis and omphalocele). During her current pregnancy, she had taken prenatal vitamins, cholecalciferol, and pyridoxine, as well as lorazepam as needed for anxiety. Prenatal screening tests were negative for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B; equivocal for immunity to rubella; and positive for group B streptococcal colonization.\nThe patient (baby) had a healthy father and sister. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her maternal grandmother, sleep apnea in her paternal grandfather, and diabetes in her paternal grandmother. In addition, her maternal aunt had thyrotoxicosis, a paternal uncle had diabetes, and another paternal uncle had blindness, deafness, and cognitive developmental delay.\nAt 39 weeks of gestation, the baby was delivered by cesarean section. The birth weight was 3060 g (35th percentile), the length 48 cm (26th percentile), and the head circumference 34.5 cm (60th percentile). She had a spontaneous cry, decreased tone, and spontaneous respirations. There was a large firm mass on the right side of the neck. The 1-minute Apgar score was 6.\nAt 3 minutes of life, increased work of breathing developed; treatment with continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm of water was administered. At 5 minutes of life, the Apgar score was 7 but the increased work of breathing worsened, with nasal flaring, grunting, and subcostal retractions; the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) was increased to 100%. At 10 minutes of life, the Apgar score was 8. Direct laryngoscopy revealed deviation of the trachea, larynx, subglottis, and right piriform sinus. Tracheal intubation was performed with rigid bronchoscopy; because of clinically significant airway obstruction, tracheostomy was performed.\nAt 8 hours of life, the blood hemoglobin level was 10.0 g per deciliter (reference range for neonates, 13.5 to 19.5), the thyrotropin level 3.82 \u03bcU per milliliter, the alpha-fetoprotein level 107,048.0 ng per milliliter (reference range, <7.9), and the beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level 7.3 IU per milliliter (reference range, <50.0).

The temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C. The volar aspect of the left wrist was erythematous and swollen, as was the left knee. Tests for Lyme disease antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Radiographs showed subcutaneous edema of the left knee but no fracture, dislocation, or evidence of advanced arthropathy of the left knee or wrist. A 10-day course of prednisone was prescribed for presumed inflammatory arthritis. The joint swelling and pain resolved.\nSix months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the same emergency department because of a painful rash. The temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C. The distal left forearm was erythematous and had scattered small subcutaneous nodules. Laboratory evaluation revealed pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and uric acid were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A plain radiograph of the left wrist showed soft-tissue edema but no abnormalities of the bone. A second course of prednisone was prescribed, and the patient was referred to a dermatologist and a gastroenterologist for consultation.\nTwo weeks later, the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had multiple tan macules on the face and trunk, angiomas, and reddish-purple papules (some >1 cm in diameter) on the left forearm. A biopsy of a papule on the left forearm was performed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed nonspecific suppurative and granulomatous dermatitis. No microorganisms were identified, and culture of the biopsy specimen was negative.\nFour months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had spider angiomas and fullness of the left upper quadrant. On a serum-based test for liver fibrosis (FibroTest), he had a score of 0.96 (with scores of 0.00 to 0.21 indicating no fibrosis and scores of 0.74 to 1.00 indicating severe fibrosis). Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. William R. Bradley: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed a nodular hepatic contour with patchy perfusion but no focal hepatic lesions (Figure 1A). Splenomegaly, portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation, and perigastric, paraesophageal, and splenorenal collateral vessels were also identified (Figure 1B and 1C). There was no dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts; the common bile duct measured 8 mm in diameter (Figure 1D).\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRCP Images.\nDr. Schaefer: Three months before the current evaluation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. Grade 2 esophageal varices were identified and banded. Eight days later, the patient was admitted to a second hospital because of new confusion, lethargy, delayed and slurred speech, and visual hallucinations. The blood ammonia level was 99 \u03bcmol per liter (169 \u03bcg per deciliter; reference range, 11 to 60 \u03bcmol per liter [19 to 102 \u03bcg per deciliter]). Urinalysis was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. Abdominal ultrasound images showed persistent splenomegaly and heterogeneous liver echotexture without ascites. A computed tomographic scan of the head, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, a pattern consistent with incomplete right bundle-branch block, downsloping ST-segment depressions in the precordium, and a prolonged corrected QT interval. Treatment with lactulose was initiated for a working diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. Confusion resolved, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day with arrangements made for additional cardiac testing after discharge.\nOne month before the current evaluation, an echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, mild right ventricular dilatation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation with right atrial dilatation, and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 71 mm Hg. Perfusion images obtained during vasodilator stress testing showed no evidence of inducible left ventricular ischemia. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation.\nIn the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported chronic dyspnea with exertion. He had no orthopnea, chest pain, or palpitations. He had consumed six beers daily for approximately 30 years but had not consumed alcohol during the previous 18 months. Three years before the current presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of dyslipidemia, with a blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 337 mg per deciliter (8.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 129 mg per deciliter [1.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter]) and a total cholesterol level of 380 mg per deciliter (9.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 155 to 199 mg per deciliter [4.0 to 5.1 mmol per liter]). He had a history of opioid use disorder, including intravenous opioids; the disorder had been in remission with the use of buprenorphine\u2013naloxone. Other medical history included depression, insomnia, and multiple knee surgeries. In addition to buprenorphine\u2013naloxone, medications included lactulose, omeprazole, and trazodone. Penicillin had caused a rash. He had worked as a laborer but was disabled and no longer working. He had smoked two cigarettes daily for 30 years. His family history included stroke in his father, diabetes in his mother, and rheumatoid arthritis in his sister.\nOn examination, the heart rate was 73 beats per minute, the blood pressure 99/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 69.9 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.9. He was alert and oriented; asterixis was present. The lung fields were clear, and there was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable hard mass in the epigastrium, a finding that indicated a probable firm caudate lobe of the liver. The knees had healed surgical scars, and there was no edema in the legs. A few spider angiomas were present on the chest. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serologic testing was negative for antinuclear antibodies and was positive for antimitochondrial antibodies, with a titer of 1:5120.\nAdditional diagnostic tests were performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Primary biliary cholangitis with portopulmonary hypertension."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Alba Coraini (Neurology): A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of back pain and leg stiffness.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 years before the current presentation, when stiffness in the back and upper legs developed abruptly while she attempted to rise from a seated position. She also began to have associated low back pain that worsened with bending the knees or climbing stairs. During the next several months, back and leg stiffness waxed and waned; at times, the patient could walk normally and engage in running for exercise, and at other times, she was unable to walk because her knees felt as though they had \u201clocked up.\u201d Two months after the onset of symptoms, the patient fell and broke her right arm. She perceived the fall as being unusual in that after she tripped, she was unable to prevent herself from falling because of tension in her legs. After the fall, the patient underwent physical therapy for several months, but she did not resume running for exercise because of a fear of falling.\nTwo and a half years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in a rheumatology clinic of another hospital. Passive flexion of the left knee was guarded, but the knee bent when a distraction technique was used; the remainder of the examination was normal. Hip and knee radiographs were reportedly unremarkable. The knee stiffness was not thought to be due to an underlying rheumatologic disorder.\nOne and a half years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated for knee pain in the sports medicine clinic affiliated with this hospital. The pain was localized to the anterior portions of the knees at the level of the patellae; it worsened with climbing stairs and resolved with rest. Examination and radiographs of the knees showed no abnormalities. Patellofemoral pain syndrome was diagnosed, and physical therapy was recommended. The knee pain resolved after physical therapy, but the patient continued to have leg stiffness and did not return to running owing to a fear of falling.\nThree months before the current presentation, the patient noticed ongoing lower back pain and increased stiffness in the legs that was worse in the right leg. She felt unsteady on her feet and worried about tripping while walking or falling while climbing stairs. While walking in her house, she hit her leg on a coffee table; both legs stiffened, and she fell, striking her face on the floor. There was no loss of consciousness. She was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, she had mild tenderness on palpation of the lumbar spine. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed normal paraspinal soft tissues and exaggeration of the normal lumbar lordosis, with preserved vertebral height. A loss of normal signal intensity was noted in the L4\u2013L5 intervertebral disk space on T2-weighted images, a finding that was consistent with mild degeneration. Evaluation for signal abnormality in the visible portion of the spinal cord and in the cauda equina nerve roots could not be assessed owing to severe motion artifact. There was no evidence of high-grade spinal canal or foraminal stenosis.\nDr. Coraini: Treatment with cyclobenzaprine, which was to be taken as needed at night for back pain, was initiated, and physical therapy was recommended. However, after 3 months of physical therapy, the back pain had not abated, and the leg stiffness had worsened. The patient sought evaluation in the neurology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the neurology clinic, the patient reported ongoing leg stiffness and rigidity that caused gait abnormalities. She noticed jerking movements at night as she was falling asleep. Three months before the current evaluation, she had taken lorazepam for claustrophobia before entering the MRI machine for spinal imaging, and her gait was reportedly normal for several hours after imaging.\nThe patient had a history of vitiligo, eczema, and alopecia areata. Graves\u2019 disease, for which she had been treated with methimazole, was in remission. Immune thrombocytopenia, which had been diagnosed 7 years before the current presentation, had been treated with a course of intravenous immune globulin. In addition to cyclobenzaprine, medications included cetirizine, desogestrel\u2013ethinyl estradiol, and a multivitamin. She had no known allergies. She lived in New England with her husband and had recently started a new job as an office manager. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. One sister had autoimmune thyroiditis, and another had alopecia areata.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/91 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.7. The patient appeared anxious but was in no acute distress. Strength was assessed as normal in the arms and legs. She had mildly increased tone in the legs; no fasciculations were present. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ in the arms and 3+ in the legs, with nonsustained clonus in the ankles. An exaggerated startle response was present. Sensation was normal. On ambulation, there was reduced flexion of the knees and a wide-based gait.\nBlood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of creatine kinase was 33 U per liter (reference range, 26 to 192), the C-reactive protein level 1 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 10), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 2 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Schaefer: MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1), was limited by motion artifact. No specific cord abnormality was identified. Mild degenerative changes were noted in the thoracolumbar spine, without moderate or severe narrowing of the spinal canal or neural foramina. No abnormal enhancement was seen. Possible atrophy of the posterior paraspinal musculature was detected in the lower lumbar spine. Exaggeration of the normal lumbar lordosis was noted.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Spine.\nDr. Coraini: A diagnostic test was performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 autoantibody\u2013associated stiff-person syndrome."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Shaan Khurshid: A 56-year-old man presented to this hospital in early autumn with a 1-month history of myalgias and fever.\nApproximately 4 weeks before the current presentation, the patient began to have generalized myalgias and arthralgias, which were worst in the shoulders, proximal arms, and upper back. He had fever with temperatures of up to 38.2\u00b0C, along with chills and diaphoresis. He took naproxen, and the next day, he presented to an urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 175/95 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Symptoms abated after 3 days, but then fever with temperatures of up to 38.3\u00b0C and fatigue occurred. The patient stopped consuming alcohol.\nThree weeks later, the patient had episodes of mild dyspnea with \u201ccoughing fits\u201d and presented to a second urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital.

He reported no weight loss, sweats, palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest discomfort, joint swelling or redness, rash, headache, focal neurologic symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, hypertension with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, palpitations, unprovoked pulmonary embolism, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperuricemia, latent tuberculosis, malaria, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, Helicobacter pylori infection, colonic schistosomiasis, prostatism, and thrombocytopenia. His last dental procedure had taken place more than 2 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, metoprolol, and losartan, as well as sildenafil as needed. He had received two vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), with the second vaccine administered 7 months before the current evaluation. There were no known adverse reactions to medication.\nThe patient grew up in equatorial Central Africa. He had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier and had not returned to Africa for more than 5 years. He was employed at a local university and occasionally had contact with college students. He lived with his family in a suburb of Boston. During the summer months, he had visited islands in Massachusetts and coastal wooded areas to hike, camp, and swim. The patient reported that he had encountered many ticks but had not received a tick bite. He had been scratched by cats; there were no other animal exposures. In the past, he had consumed two or three beers daily, but he had stopped all alcohol intake during the previous month. He had never used tobacco or illicit substances. His family history was notable for atherosclerotic coronary disease.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 46 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.4. He appeared comfortable. Auscultation of the chest revealed a bradycardic heart rate. There was tenderness on palpation of the left infrascapular area. A prostate examination revealed a nontender hemorrhoid. There was no rash or lymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal.\nBlood levels of calcium, total protein, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Electrocardiograms were notable for sinus rhythm with first-degree and second-degree (2:1) atrioventricular block with intermittent right bundle-branch block (Figure 1A), alternating with sinus rhythm with third-degree (complete) atrioventricular block and junctional escape rhythm with intraventricular conduction delay (Figure 1B). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was negative for pulmonary embolism.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Cardiac Imaging Studies.\nIntravenous ceftriaxone, naproxen, acetaminophen, and oxycodone were administered. The patient was evaluated by an electrophysiologist and admitted to the cardiology unit of this hospital. The next day, the heart rate remained at approximately 40 beats per minute, and the maximum temperature was 37.8\u00b0C. Oxycodone and topical lidocaine were administered.\nDr. Alex L. Huang: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal biventricular systolic function, with no regional left ventricular wall-motion abnormalities. There was mild diastolic mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (Figure 1C), a finding consistent with atrioventricular block.1 There was no evidence of valvular vegetations.\nDr. Khurshid: The blood level of high-sensitivity troponin was 63 ng per liter. Urinalysis was negative, as were blood tests for Lyme disease antibodies, anti-rickettsia IgM, ehrlichia and anaplasma DNA, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, and babesia.\nOn the third hospital day, tests for SARS-CoV-2, Bartonella henselae and B. quintana antibodies, and anti-treponemal antibodies were negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive.\nDr. Borek Foldyna: The patient underwent cardiac CT with electrocardiographic gating, including contrast-enhanced CT angiography and delayed imaging. Epicardial fat and a thickened interatrial septum abutting the noncoronary sinus of the aortic valve showed increased radiodensity on delayed imaging (Figure 2A and 2B); these findings are suggestive of inflammatory changes and may indicate evolving abscess. The tricuspid aortic valve had mildly thickened leaflets, but there was no evidence of focal valvular vegetations, thrombi, or calcifications.\nFIGURE 2\n\nAdvanced Cardiac Imaging Studies.\nDr. Khurshid: Oral doxycycline was administered. On the fourth hospital day, the ventricular rate measured between 30 and 40 beats per minute, and the maximum temperature was 37.9\u00b0C.", "ground_truth_output": "Regional myocarditis due to infection with Listeria monocytogenes."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Adam Tanious (Surgery): A 37-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of abdominal pain and aortic dilatation.\nThe patient had been well until 3 weeks before the current admission, when she began to have pain in the right side of the abdomen that radiated to the back. She also had nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. Approximately 2 weeks before the current admission, she sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. Physical examination was notable for pain with palpation of all four quadrants. The pulses were normal, and the blood pressure did not differ substantially between the two arms or between the two legs. The white-cell count was 9800 per microliter (reference range at the other hospital, 4800 to 10,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 41 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the C-reactive protein level 44.0 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 10.0).

Sutphin: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed soft-tissue density adjacent to the infrarenal abdominal aorta and mild-to-moderate associated periaortic fat stranding (Figure 1A and 1B). These findings prompted CT angiography, performed 1 hour later, which more clearly delineated infrarenal abdominal aortic wall thickening at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery, with an aortic diameter of 2.3 cm (Figure 1C).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Tanious: The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital on the same day, with a referral to the rheumatology clinic of that hospital and instructions to start treatment with prednisone. One day after discharge, one of the four culture bottles grew gram-positive bacilli, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital for investigation. After an evaluation, the positive culture was presumed to be contaminated. Additional blood specimens were obtained for culture, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day.\nThe fever and chills resolved, and the abdominal pain abated initially but then gradually worsened. Eight days after discharge and 3 days before the current admission, the patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 50 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 146/78 mm Hg. Physical examination was notable for diffuse abdominal tenderness, which was worse with deep palpation in all four quadrants. The white-cell count was 32,800 per microliter, the platelet count 565,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level 110.0 mg per liter. The urinalysis was normal; urine toxicologic screening was positive for amphetamines, cannabinoids, and opiates. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Sutphin: CT angiography revealed progression of aortic wall thickening and periaortic fat stranding and interval narrowing of the proximal segment of the inferior mesenteric artery, with an increase in the aortic diameter to 3.1 cm.\nDr. Tanious: The patient was admitted to the other hospital for a second time. Intravenous fluids, methylprednisolone, and heparin were administered, as was empirical treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam. During the next 3 days, the patient remained afebrile. Consultations with the rheumatology, infectious diseases, and vascular surgery departments were requested.\nDr. Sutphin: On the second hospital day, magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen revealed an increase in aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta (aortic diameter, 3.6 cm) with enhancement of the aortic wall. On the fourth hospital day, CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a further increase in aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta (aortic diameter, 3.9 cm) with increasing luminal irregularity and periaortic fat stranding.\nDr. Tanious: The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional treatment. On evaluation, she reported abdominal pain that was worst in the right upper quadrant and radiated to the right lower quadrant, back, and chest. She rated the pain as 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She also reported nausea but had not had fevers or chills since before the initial presentation. A review of systems was notable for the absence of fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, myalgias, joint pain, and rash; blue fingertips occurred with exposure to cold.\nDr. Sutphin: CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed evidence of continued aneurysmal enlargement and increased luminal irregularity (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F).\nDr. Tanious: The patient had a history of polycystic ovary syndrome, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder, asthma, and Chiari I malformation, which had led to suboccipital craniectomy 3 years earlier. She had undergone cesarean section 5 years earlier. Medications included prednisone, clonidine, promethazine, dicyclomine, and inhaled albuterol; latex had caused a rash. The patient was White, lived in an urban area of New England, and had recently been homeless. She had injected heroin for the past 5 years; her last injection had been 3 weeks earlier. She had a history of marijuana use and reported no methamphetamine use. Sexual history was not obtained. She drank four alcoholic beverages and smoked one pack of cigarettes daily. Her sister had rheumatoid arthritis, her grandmother had tuberculosis, and several family members had hypermobility of the joints.\nOn examination, the patient was uncomfortable because of the abdominal pain. The abdomen was soft, with diffuse tenderness that was worst in the right upper quadrant and both lower quadrants. She did not have any ulcers, rash, lymphadenopathy, or warmth, redness, or swelling of the joints; the elbows and metacarpophalangeal joints were hyperextensible. The white-cell count was 27,710 per microliter (reference range at this hospital, 4500 to 11,000), the platelet count 576,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 57 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the C-reactive protein level 60.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 8.0). Testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was negative. Serologic testing for hepatitis C virus was positive. The blood-culture isolate detected at the other hospital was identified as bacillus species, and all other blood cultures performed at the other hospital showed no growth. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nManagement decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and infection of a vascular graft."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Viral S. Shah: A 26-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of respiratory failure and altered mental status.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current admission, when she underwent elective abdominoplasty and liposuction at an ambulatory surgery center. During the procedure, anesthetic agents included intravenous propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, and ketamine, as well as local lidocaine injections. During recovery after the procedure, medications included intravenous cefazolin, enoxaparin, and ondansetron; oral oxycodone, tramadol, and gabapentin; and transdermal scopolamine. The patient was lethargic after the procedure but was able to be discharged home after a period of observation.\nLater that day, the patient was instructed by telephone to take a lower dose of postoperative oxycodone. The next day, on evaluation at the surgical center, she was found to be somnolent but arousable and able to answer questions with effort; the scopolamine patch was removed. Several hours after the patient returned home, her family noticed that she had increased respiratory effort and minimal responsiveness. She was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of a local hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/77 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 83% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was lethargic, moaned intermittently, and responded with one-word answers; symmetric movement in the arms and legs was observed. Intravenous naloxone was administered, with minor improvement in her condition. Levels of electrolytes and results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Mendoza: A chest radiograph showed diffuse confluent opacities in both lungs (Figure 1A). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary-embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed diffuse mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving all lobes of the lungs, with relative sparing of the subpleural lung (Figure 1B). CT of the abdomen revealed postoperative changes. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild effacement of the cerebral sulci and cisterns on both sides, a finding suggestive of mild diffuse cerebral edema (Figure 1C and 1D). There was also a small hypodensity in the left globus pallidus, a finding suggestive of infarction.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies.\nDr. Shah: Noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the other hospital. Intravenous vancomycin, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir were administered empirically, and a triple-lumen central venous catheter was inserted.\nThe next morning, the findings on a repeat chest radiograph appeared to be unchanged, but the patient had progressive lethargy, so intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Pink frothy secretions were noted. Intravenous methylprednisolone, propofol, and norepinephrine were administered. A nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. The troponin I level increased to 4.31 ng per milliliter (reference range, <0.029). The thyrotropin, carboxyhemoglobin, and lipase levels were normal, and tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigens were negative.\nLater that afternoon, the patient was transferred to the ICU at this hospital. A review of systems was unavailable because intubation was performed on arrival. Medical history that was obtained from family members included iron-deficiency anemia, anxiety disorder, insomnia, and two normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Regular medications included lorazepam as needed for sleep; postoperative medications included tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone as needed for pain. There were no known adverse reactions to medication. The patient had attended college and worked in an office. She lived with her husband and children. She drank alcohol intermittently and did not use tobacco or other substances. There was no family history of cardiopulmonary or neurologic disorders.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg while the patient was receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 8 \u03bcg per minute. The height was 168 cm and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.8. The oxygen saturation was 99% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in volume-control mode (tidal volume, 320 ml; positive end-expiratory pressure, 12 cm of water; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0). The pupils were 2 mm and symmetrically reactive. The lung sounds were coarse. The abdominal incision was well approximated and without drainage; abdominal drains were in place on both sides. A neurologic examination with interruption of sedation showed spontaneous eye-opening but an inability to visually track and to follow commands. Brain-stem reflexes were intact. The legs withdrew equally and briskly in response to pain. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nA chest radiograph showed diffuse opacities in both lungs. Levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, creatine kinase, lipase, and ammonia were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Urine toxicologic screening was negative except for the presence of opiates. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram including posterior leads showed sinus rhythm, rightward axis deviation, diminutive Q waves, and minor nonspecific ST\u2013T-wave abnormalities. An abdominal radiograph showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern, subcutaneous emphysema, and surgical drains over the pelvis. On bedside cardiac ultrasonography, the left ventricle could not be visualized clearly, but right ventricular dilatation did not appear to be present. Intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered.\nDr. Mendoza: CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed hypodensities in the left basal ganglia and right cerebellum that were suggestive of infarcts; the previously described cerebral edema had reduced slightly. A CT angiogram of the head and neck was normal. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a reduction in ground-glass opacities but an increase in consolidations, particularly in the lower lobes. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a small anterior abdominal hematoma and diffuse subcutaneous emphysema.\nDr. Shah: A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. On hospital day 2, the findings on neurologic examination worsened, with only sluggish eye-opening and no motor responses to noxious stimuli. Intravenous mannitol at a dose of 1 g per kilogram of body weight was administered.\nDr. Mendoza: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a hypodensity in the left globus pallidus that had not changed from the previous study, as well as a hypodensity in the right cerebellum that was not definitive and was probably an artifact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed infarcts within the globi pallidi and smaller punctate infarcts in the cerebral white matter. There were also innumerable diffuse microhemorrhagic foci affecting the cerebral white matter, including the corpus callosum (Figure 2).\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Shah: Bronchoscopy revealed bloody mucus in the distal trachea (Figure 3). Serial bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed in the right upper lobe revealed increasingly erythematous effluent.\nFIGURE 3\n\nImages Obtained on Bronchoscopy.\nLupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were not detected. Levels of C3 and C4 were normal. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Tests for legionella, streptococcus, and galactomannan urinary antigens and antitreponemal antibodies were negative, as was a repeat nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2.\nDr. Yasmin Aghajan: On hospital day 3, the patient underwent continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. The study was abnormal because of generalized rhythmic delta activity at a frequency of 1 Hz, which occasionally evolved to generalized periodic discharges superimposed on a disorganized background with irregular delta and theta slowing. There were no epileptiform abnormalities. Although generalized rhythmic delta activity and generalized periodic discharges are on the ictal\u2013interictal continuum, there were no features suggestive of seizures. The electroencephalographic findings were consistent with encephalopathy and the effects of propofol.\nA diagnosis was made.", "ground_truth_output": "Fat embolism syndrome."}, {"user_input": "Dr. David J. Bozym (Medicine): A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypokalemia and paranoid thoughts.\nSix months before the current admission, discomfort on the right side of the chest developed, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital.\nDr. Mark C. Murphy: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung that measured 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm, as well as bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImages Obtained 6 Months before Current Admission.\nDr. Bozym: An endobronchial ultrasound\u2013guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node was performed. Cytologic examination of the specimen revealed small-cell carcinoma.\nFive months before the current admission, the patient sought a second opinion in the oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient was counseled about the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer and the need for additional imaging before consideration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Additional imaging was scheduled, along with a follow-up appointment. The patient did not undergo additional imaging and did not attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic of either this hospital or the other hospital.\nSix weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed swelling of both legs. Ten days before this admission, the swelling had not abated, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient described himself as generally healthy and did not report any chronic health conditions. He reported no fever, chills, shortness of breath, or pain. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s brother. The patient had been pursuing alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer that included a strict diet and intravenous infusions, and he had not shared the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer with his family until several days earlier. The patient\u2019s brother believed that the patient was in denial about the diagnosis.\nWhen the patient was 12 years of age, he had received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which had been treated with radiation therapy and splenectomy. Fifteen years before this presentation, ischemic colitis had been treated with small-bowel resection. One year before this presentation, deep-vein thrombosis had been treated with a 4-month course of anticoagulation. There was no history of psychiatric disease. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies; he did not disclose details about the infusions that he had received as alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents. He was divorced and frequently visited his children. He worked part-time as a skilled tradesman. Family members reported that he was a lifelong nonsmoker.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 167/95 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and appeared well, but he looked thinner than he had looked during his evaluation at the oncology clinic 5 months earlier. The abdomen had a healed surgical scar, and the legs had symmetric 1+ edema. The blood potassium level was 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.1); the white-cell count was 14,630 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000).

CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed numerous new ill-defined rim-enhancing hepatic lesions, which measured up to 8.0 cm in diameter; an adrenal mass, which measured 4.1 cm by 3.4 cm; and thrombosis of the branches of the right portal vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal.\nFIGURE 2\n\nImages Obtained on Current Admission.\nDr. Bozym: Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the next 3 days, additional supplemental potassium was administered. During follow-up interviews, the patient acknowledged the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer, but he did not explain why he had not shared the diagnosis with his family or provide details about the alternative treatment that he had pursued. On the fourth hospital day, the blood potassium level increased, and the patient asked to go home. He stated that he was willing to attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic, but he was evasive when chemotherapy and immunotherapy were discussed. The patient was discharged.\nOne week after discharge, and 1 day before the current admission, the patient\u2019s father accompanied the patient to receive massage therapy and an intravenous infusion as alternative treatment. During the infusion, the patient abruptly became volatile, agitated, and angry. On the drive home, he refused to close the window and stared into the distance. He stated that doctors had cast spells on him during his recent hospitalization and that he had killed his oldest child, which was not true.\nThe next day, the patient borrowed his brother\u2019s car without permission and drove across the state. After he returned home, family members brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient stated that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d for being in the hospital. He initially reported no symptoms, but on specific questioning, he acknowledged fatigue, weight loss, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and ongoing leg swelling. He reported that he did not feel confused, afraid, or worried and that he had no suicidal or homicidal thoughts or auditory or visual hallucinations. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family members. The patient had not slept for several days. His aggressive and erratic behavior and delusions were not typical, although he could become easily angered and had a long-standing belief that his doctors had administered radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma to make money.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 194/106 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The patient alternated between being alert and lethargic, and he could state the names of his children but not their ages. He was cooperative but intermittently paused and stared; he was not distracted by external stimuli, but he seemed to be responding to internal stimuli. He spoke only a couple of words at a time and answered most questions by nodding or shaking his head. There was generalized weakness, which was most pronounced in the proximal muscle groups. The leg edema was unchanged, and the skin appeared abnormally tan; there was no scleral icterus, sublingual jaundice, or asterixis.\nThe blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter, the carbon dioxide level 37 mmol per liter (reference range, 22 to 32), and the ammonia level 51 \u03bcmol per liter (87 \u03bcg per deciliter; reference range, 12 to 48 \u03bcmol per liter [20 to 82 \u03bcg per deciliter]). The white-cell count was 13,530 per microliter. Urinalysis was normal, and urine and blood toxicologic testing was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, was normal. Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter.\nA diagnostic test was performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Cushing\u2019s syndrome due to ectopic secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone from small-cell lung cancer."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Will Pohlman (Medicine): An 82-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of difficulty walking, falls, and cognitive decline.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health, living independently with her husband and participating in a walking club, until 8 months before the current presentation, when generalized weakness developed. She began to walk more slowly and was no longer active with her walking club; she felt limited by pain in her feet.\nFive months before the current presentation, the patient began to have difficulty with climbing stairs and with rising from a seated position. Four months before the current presentation, she began to have falls at home.\nThree months before the current presentation, the patient fell and her husband was not able to lift her up from the floor. Emergency medical services were called, and she was admitted to another hospital for evaluation. During that hospitalization, a urinary tract infection and hyponatremia were diagnosed. The urinary tract infection was treated with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. The hyponatremia was attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone and was treated with fluid restriction and salt tablets. The use of a walker was recommended, and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. After 3 weeks in the rehabilitation facility, she was discharged home, but she fell again at home and subsequently returned to the other hospital for evaluation. She was readmitted to the other hospital and again discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\nEight weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from the rehabilitation facility, and she and her husband moved to an assisted-living facility. Fatigue developed, along with loss of appetite and a reduced intake of food. The patient began to need one-person assistance to walk. She also noticed that she had been having difficulty with math associated with the family finances, which she had always done with ease. Her family noticed that she had been having trouble carrying on a conversation and that she seemed less attentive than usual.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, the patient had another fall and was admitted to a second hospital, where she was found to have hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head reportedly showed moderate chronic small-vessel ischemic changes and ventriculomegaly. Increased food intake was encouraged, and outpatient evaluation in the neurology clinic affiliated with the second hospital was arranged. Discharge to a rehabilitation facility was recommended, but after discussions between the patient and her family, the patient returned to the assisted-living facility.\nAfter discharge from the hospital, the patient had a progressive loss of independence. She noted worsening generalized weakness and low back pain, and she needed two-person assistance to walk. Her family brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported urinary incontinence, which she attributed to not having enough time to get to the toilet because of her physical limitations with movement; she had no dysuria or urinary urgency. There was no fecal incontinence.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. Surgical history included hemiarthroplasty of the right shoulder and arthroplasty of both knees. She had chronic pain in the shoulders, knees, wrists, and hands, which had been attributed to osteoarthritis; the knee and shoulder pain had decreased after the surgeries but then returned during the year before the current presentation. Medications included atorvastatin, calcium citrate, levothyroxine, lisinopril, and tramadol. She had no known drug allergies. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. In addition to her husband, her support network included four children who lived near the assisted-living facility. She was retired and had previously worked in finance. Her mother had had diabetes, and her father had had thyroid cancer; there was no known family history of dementia or neurodegenerative disorders.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/54 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. She appeared tired but was oriented to person and place. Pitting edema was present in the legs to the level of the mid-shins. A detailed strength examination was limited because of pain, with minimal movement of the shoulders, wrists, fingers, ankles, and knees. The patient could wiggle her toes but had weak plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of both feet. She could easily wiggle her fingers and lift her arms against gravity at the elbows. Light touch of the dorsum of the right hand caused pain, as did light touch of the right knee and the soles of both feet. Recognition of sensation to light touch and to vibration were normal. Cerebellar testing, gait testing, and reflex testing were limited by severe pain with movement and touch. The patient had symmetric erythema, swelling, and tenderness of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. She had limited range of motion in the wrists and elbows, along with symmetric tenderness in the subtalar joints and swelling and pain with squeezing of the metatarsophalangeal joints.\nThe blood levels of alcohol, ammonia, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and urine toxicology screening; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 3+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative) and the presence of nitrates (reference value, negative), and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10).

Huang: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed moderate ventriculomegaly that was out of proportion to the enlargement of the cerebral sulci (Figure 1).\nFIGURE 1\n\nCT of the Head.\nDr. Pohlman: A high-volume lumbar puncture with gait evaluation before and after the procedure was not possible, given the patient\u2019s inability to walk unassisted. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus was generally thought to be unlikely to explain her presentation. Altered mental status was attributed to delirium in the context of tramadol use and urinary tract infection. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nOn hospital day 2, the urine culture grew Citrobacter farmeri; treatment with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was started. MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was terminated early because of the patient\u2019s pain, and the images that were obtained were degraded by motion artifacts. However, no marked signal abnormality in the spinal cord or high-grade spinal or foraminal stenosis was observed. Additional laboratory studies were obtained. Tests for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus antibodies, and hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative. The blood levels of glycated hemoglobin and cobalamin were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation; blood samples were obtained for measurement of copper and vitamin B6 levels. Treatment with gabapentin was started for neuropathic pain. On hospital day 3, pain had not decreased, and the dose of gabapentin was increased.\nDr. Bart K. Chwalisz: On hospital day 4, electromyography and nerve conduction studies were performed. The amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was normal with stimulation of the right tibial nerve but was reduced with stimulation of the left tibial nerve and both peroneal nerves; in addition, the CMAP amplitude of the left ulnar nerve was mildly reduced, and that of the left median nerve was normal. The sensory-nerve action potential of the left radial nerve was normal, but the sensory-nerve action potential of the left sural nerve could not be obtained. The conduction velocities and distal latencies were normal. There was no abnormal spontaneous activity in any muscle examined. The motor-unit action potentials and motor-unit recruitment with voluntary activation were normal throughout.\nDr. Pohlman: The results of the additional blood tests became available. The copper level was normal, and the vitamin B6 level was less than 2 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50). Treatment with vitamin B6 supplementation was started.\nAdditional diagnostic tests were performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Rheumatoid arthritis with vasculitis causing a confluent mononeuritis multiplex."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Carolina Geadas (Medicine): A 70-year-old man with a history of kidney transplantation was evaluated at this hospital because of multiple erythematous rashes that had developed during an admission for respiratory failure, pneumococcal bacteremia, and kidney failure.\nApproximately 4.5 years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013associated vasculitis after he presented with progressive glomerulonephritis with kidney failure and new hemoptysis. The anti-myeloperoxidase antibody titer was 221.0 U (reference value, <2.8). The patient underwent plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were administered. Hemodialysis was initiated. Two weeks later, rituximab was administered, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were discontinued. During the next 4 years, his renal function did not improve, and treatment with rituximab and hemodialysis was continued.\nFour months before the current admission, the patient underwent transplantation of a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C virus antibody\u2013positive status. After the kidney transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy included a dose of basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and tapering doses of prednisone. The patient had delayed graft function; the blood creatinine level decreased from approximately 4.00 mg per deciliter (354 mmol per liter) immediately after transplantation to 1.50 mg per deciliter (133 mmol per liter) 6 weeks later. Six days before the current admission, at a routine follow-up visit, the creatinine level was 1.33 mg per deciliter (118 mmol per liter).\nFour days before the current admission, the patient began to have central abdominal discomfort, nausea, anorexia, chills, and diarrhea with loose stools three times per day. During the next several days, he noticed decreased urine output and malaise, and he began to have rhinorrhea, cough, sinus congestion, and dyspnea. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems was notable for palpitations and dizziness and was negative for fever, emesis, and hematuria. The patient\u2019s brother had recently received a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for vasculitis with end-stage kidney disease (culminating in kidney transplantation), coronary artery disease (with placement of a stent in the right coronary artery), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cholelithiasis (with cholecystectomy), colonic polyps and diverticulosis, gout, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, hernia (with hernia repair), and spinal stenosis. Medications taken at home included mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, prednisone, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, valganciclovir, warfarin, aspirin, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, and cholecalciferol, as well as lorazepam as needed. Penicillin had caused anaphylaxis.\nThe patient was a retired business owner and lived with family in Boston. He had a remote history of tobacco smoking that totaled 10 pack-years; he had quit smoking approximately 40 years earlier. He did not drink alcohol or use other substances. His family history was notable for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease in his father and siblings. There was no known family history of kidney or autoimmune disease.\nThe temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/56 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air, 92% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 60 liters per minute. On examination, he appeared acutely ill and weak. He had bitemporal cachexia, dry oral mucosa, and increased work of breathing. Auscultation of the chest revealed tachypnea, diminished breath sounds and crackles in the lungs, and tachycardia. There was tenderness in the periumbilical area and the right lower quadrant, at the site of the kidney transplantation; the incision was well healed.\nBlood levels of lipase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine specimens were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed possible sinus tachycardia with right bundle-branch block. Vancomycin and cefepime were administered intravenously. Three hours after presentation, a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was positive, and remdesivir and dexamethasone were administered intravenously.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), On Initial Evaluation, Hospital Day 4, Hospital Day 14\n\nBlood\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 13.5\u201317.5, 13.8, 10.1, 7.7\nHematocrit (%), 41.0\u201353.0, 41.5, 29.8, 24.0\nWhite\u2011cell count (per \u00b5l), 4500\u201311,000, 320, 9520, 3250\n\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l)\nNeutrophils, 1800\u20137700, 50, 8580, 3050\nLymphocytes, 1000\u20134800, 60, 80, 30\nMonocytes, 200\u20131200, 110, 580, 80\nEosinophils, 0\u2013900, \u2014, 0, 80\n\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 168,000, 106,000, 35,000\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 132, 134, 138\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 3.1, 4.8, 4.9\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 95, 101, 103\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 19, 18, 18\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 67, 31, 20\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 4.08, 1.63, 1.02\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 83, 170, 161\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 3.5, 1.8, 2.3\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 18, 190, 36\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201340, 61, 814, 46\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013115, 63, 134, 90\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 1.2, 2.8, 4.4\nDirect bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20130.4, 0.8, 2.2, 4.0\nLactate (mmol/liter), 0.5\u20132.2, 1.5, 2.4, 2.0\nProthrombin time (sec), 11.5\u201314.5, 56.8, 21.2, 18.4\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.9\u20131.1, 6.8, 1.9, 1.6\nPartial-thromboplastin time (sec), 22.0\u201336.0, \u2014, 76.8, 44.6\nTacrolimus (ng/ml), >2.0, 29.9, 13.1, 3.2\nHigh-sensitivity troponin T (ng/liter), 0\u20139, 105, \u2014, \u2014\nN-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (pg/ml), <900, 63,959, \u2014, \u2014\nC-reactive protein (mg/liter), 0.0\u20138.0, 120.4, \u2014, \u2014\nFerritin (\u00b5g/liter), 20\u2013300, 4261, \u2014, \u2014\nD-dimer (ng/ml), <500, \u2014, 916, \u2014\n\nArterial blood gas\nFraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, \u2014, 0.30, 0.55\npH, 7.35\u20137.45, \u2014, 7.38, 7.31\nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 35\u201342, \u2014, 31, 40\nPartial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 80\u2013100, \u2014, 80, 65\n\nUrine\nColor, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, \u2014\nClarity, Clear, Turbid, Slightly cloudy, \u2014\npH, 5.0\u20139.0, 5.5, 6.0, \u2014\nSpecific gravity, 1.001\u20131.035, 1.019, 1.020, \u2014\nGlucose, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nKetones, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nLeukocyte esterase, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nNitrite, Negative, Negative, Negative, \u2014\nBlood, Negative, 2+, 3+, \u2014\nProtein, Negative, 2+, 2+, \u2014\nErythrocytes (per high-power field), 0\u20132, 10\u201320, 20\u201350, \u2014\nLeukocytes (per high-power field), <10, 0, 10\u201320, \u2014\nBacteria, None, 1+, 2+, \u2014\n\nDr. Joseph D. King: Radiography of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed confluent basilar consolidation in the left lung and scattered patchy opacities in the right lung. Ultrasonography that targeted the renal allograft revealed normal renal parenchyma and a trace amount of adjacent free fluid. Doppler ultrasonography (Figure 1B through 1E) showed patent vasculature with normal flow velocities but showed elevated renal arterial resistive indexes, which are suggestive of allograft dysfunction. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1F and 1G), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed confluent consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs, with more extensive findings in the left lung than in the right lung, as well as patchy multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of both lungs and the middle lobe of the right lung. Concurrent CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1H), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was remarkable for only a trace amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant, along the renal allograft.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Geadas: The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital. Phenylephrine was administered intravenously. He could not be weaned from the high-flow nasal cannula; because he had increased work of breathing and tachypnea, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation initiated. Bronchoscopy revealed dark secretions in the lower lobe and lingula of the left lung. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae in four of four bottles. A blood test for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative, and serum levels of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan and galactomannan were undetectable. Azithromycin, cefepime, linezolid, amiodarone, furosemide, and vitamin K were administered intravenously, and valganciclovir and atovaquone were administered orally. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed low-normal ventricular function, atrial enlargement, and no valvular vegetations. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated. ANCA titers were undetectable.\nOn hospital day 3, excoriation and erythema of the buttock and a purpuric plaque on the sacrum were noted (Figure 2A). Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no changes. Punch biopsy of skin on the right buttock was performed. The antibiotic regimen was transitioned to intravenous ceftriaxone.\nFIGURE 2\n\nClinical Photographs.\nThe following day, histologic examination of the skin-biopsy specimen revealed epidermal necrosis, with scattered apoptotic and necrotic keratinocytes and extravasated erythrocytes. No microorganisms were identified, and microbiologic culture of the biopsy specimen was negative. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 4 are shown in Table 1.\nDuring the next 6 days, treatment with continuous venovenous hemofiltration and intravenous ceftriaxone was continued. The level of mechanical ventilation was reduced from mandatory provided breaths to spontaneous ventilation, and the mode was switched to pressure-support ventilation. Repeat blood cultures were negative. On hospital day 11, the patient\u2019s respiratory status worsened; the fraction of inspired oxygen was increased, and a mandatory respiratory rate was reinstituted.\nTwo days later, a new well-circumscribed purpuric patch was noted on the abdomen (Figure 2B). The patch measured 5 cm in greatest dimension and had a hyperpigmented halo but had no fluctuance or crepitus. The next day, a similar-appearing lesion was noted on the right thigh. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 14 are shown in Table 1.\nDr. King: Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed increased consolidative and ground-glass opacities in both lungs.\nDr. Geadas: Ceftriaxone was discontinued, and vancomycin, cefepime, and liposomal amphotericin B were administered intravenously. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Mucormycosis."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Prashanth Rajarajan (Neurology): A 78-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of progressive confusion and evolving changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 months before the current admission, when she began to have a flat affect, which the patient\u2019s daughter had attributed to grief after the death of the patient\u2019s sister. The patient had a 3-year history of mild problems with memory, but more severe memory issues had developed along with the change in affect. Four months before the current admission, she was admitted to another hospital after an acute episode of word-finding difficulty that had been witnessed by her daughter.\nDr. Saurabh Rohatgi: At that time, MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1A and 1B), revealed a subcentimeter focus of high signal intensity in the right frontal lobe on diffusion-weighted sequences and \u201cpseudonormalization\u201d on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient, with corresponding T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showing hyperintensity consistent with subacute infarction. T2-weighted FLAIR images also showed multiple foci of hyperintensity (measuring up to 1.1 cm in diameter) in both cerebellar hemispheres that were consistent with chronic infarcts. In addition, multiple areas of hyperintensity were seen on T2-weighted FLAIR images in the periventricular, deep, and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres; these findings were suggestive of small-vessel disease. Gradient-echo sequences showed several punctate foci of susceptibility in a lobar distribution, findings that were consistent with chronic microhemorrhages. Magnetic resonance angiography (Figure 1C) showed normal intracranial arteries.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI and Magnetic Resonance Angiography of the Head.\nDr. Rajarajan: Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function, dilatation of the atria and right ventricle, moderate mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and no evidence of intracardiac shunting. Treatment with aspirin was started, and the patient was discharged home on hospital day 3 with a plan for extended outpatient cardiac monitoring.\nTen days after discharge, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. The patient\u2019s daughter, who had been living with her since discharge from the hospital because she did not think that the patient was safe living alone, accompanied her to the appointment. The patient\u2019s daughter reported that the patient had been impulsive and occasionally confused, as well as progressively more forgetful. Attention and focus were impaired, and the patient had to be redirected during the interview. The remainder of the examination was normal. Treatment with mirtazapine was started for possible depression. Electroencephalography (EEG) was scheduled to rule out seizure with a postictal state as a cause of confusion. However, owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the EEG was canceled.\nDuring the next 14 weeks, the patient needed progressively more assistance with activities of daily living, including multiple reminders to eat meals and help with bathing. Her episodes of confusion occurred mostly at night. When these episodes began to increase in frequency, the patient\u2019s daughter brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nThe patient had difficulty recalling past and recent events, and additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s daughter. The patient had had an 11-kg weight loss during the preceding 3 months that the daughter had attributed to an improved diet while they were living together. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, emphysema, sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, and obesity. Stage II infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast had been diagnosed 17 years before the current admission and had been treated with lumpectomy and chemoradiation therapy, followed by 3 years of treatment with tamoxifen and exemestane. The patient continued to undergo surveillance with alternating mammography and MRI of the breasts every 6 months; the last breast MRI, which had been performed 5 months before the current admission, showed normal results. Stage 1 adenocarcinoma of the lung had been diagnosed 14 years before the current admission and had been treated with surgical resection. The patient continued to undergo surveillance with annual computed tomography (CT) of the chest; the last CT of the chest, which had been performed 13 months before the current admission, showed a stable nodule in the right upper lobe that measured 7 mm in diameter.\nMedications included esomeprazole, dulaglutide, hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, losartan, metformin, rosuvastatin, inhaled fluticasone, inhaled formoterol, and as-needed treatment with ipratropium\u2013albuterol delivered by nebulizer. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was retired and had previously worked as a nurse. She was divorced and had lived independently in New England until she was hospitalized 4 months before the current admission. She drank alcohol occasionally and had a 75-pack-year smoking history and quit after lung cancer was diagnosed. Her mother had had coronary artery disease, and her father had had emphysema.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 162/71 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 167.6 cm, the weight 91.3 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.4. The patient was alert and interactive; she was oriented to name only. She was inattentive and tangential in conversation, with perseveration. Her speech was fluent without paraphasic errors. Cranial-nerve function was normal. Test results for strength, sensation, deep-tendon reflexes, and cerebellar function were normal.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, thyrotropin, cobalamin, lactate dehydrogenase, cortisol, and C-reactive protein were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function and coagulation. The complete blood count and differential count were normal except for the level of hemoglobin, which was 10.2 g per liter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 35 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). Screening tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative, as was an interferon-\u03b3 release assay to detect previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Rohatgi: Chest radiography showed bibasilar patchy opacities. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new symmetric, confluent signal hyperintensity in the bilateral hippocampi, amygdala, and medial and anterior temporal lobes on T2-weighted and FLAIR images (Figure 1D and 1E). There was no evidence of acute or subacute infarction or associated abnormal enhancement. Multiple punctate foci of susceptibility were seen in a predominantly lobar distribution in both cerebral hemispheres on susceptibility-weighted imaging (Figure 1F) \u2014 a finding that was suggestive of microhemorrhages. New hemosiderin staining was present within the sulci of the right parietal lobe.\nDr. Rajarajan: A lumbar puncture was performed for evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which was clear and colorless. In the third tube of CSF, there were 3 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5) and 8 red cells per microliter (reference value, 0). The CSF level of protein was 47 mg per deciliter (reference range, 8 to 32) and the glucose level 112 mg per deciliter (6.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 40 to 70 mg per deciliter [2.2 to 3.9 mmol per liter]). The concurrent blood level of glucose was 191 mg per deciliter (10.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 74 to 100 mg per deciliter [4.1 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). There were 16 oligoclonal bands (reference range, 0 to 1); an IgG index was not obtained. No organisms were seen on Gram\u2019s staining, and nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA was negative. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\nAn EEG showed diffuse delta and theta slowing and disorganization of the background. There were abundant bilateral independent, temporal epileptiform discharges as well as brief runs of independent, lateralized periodic discharges in both temporal lobes.\nDiagnostic tests were performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis due to small-cell lung carcinoma and concurrent cerebral amyloid angiopathy."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Richard A. Newcomb: A 49-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\nFourteen months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated at another hospital because of pain in the right upper quadrant that had begun 4 days earlier and was associated with nausea and vomiting. Abdominal imaging revealed evidence of acute cholecystitis. Initial laboratory test results showed peripheral blasts that were suggestive of acute leukemia. The patient was transferred to a second hospital for additional evaluation. At the second hospital, abdominal imaging confirmed acute cholecystitis, and a calculus was found lodged in the neck of the gallbladder. The white-cell count was 4200 per microliter (reference range, 4200 to 9900), of which 40% were blasts. A peripheral-blood smear was notable for circulating blasts with Auer rods. The hemoglobin level was 11.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.0 to 17.4), and the platelet count was 22,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000). A bone marrow biopsy was performed, followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nDr. Andrew M. Crabbe: The bone marrow biopsy performed at the second hospital was inadequate owing to the small size of the specimen; however, intact bone marrow particles showed a cellularity of 95 to 100%. A 300-cell differential count on combined touch-imprint and aspirate smears showed 39% blasts, 3% promyelocytes, 19% neutrophils and precursors, 5% erythroid precursors, 30% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, and less than 1% basophils. The blasts were medium in size, with irregular nuclear contours, moderately clumped chromatin, occasional prominent small nucleoli, and scant granular cytoplasm. Auer rods were identified. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood identified myeloid blasts that were negative for CD34 and HLA-DR and positive for CD117, CD33, CD13, and myeloperoxidase. Cytogenetic analysis of the peripheral blood with the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a normal karyotype (46,XY) and no evidence of a t(15;17) chromosomal translocation. Molecular testing of the peripheral blood by means of dedicated polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing and next-generation sequencing identified mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, and NRAS and did not identify mutations in FLT3, IDH1, or IDH2. The overall findings of this testing were consistent with the World Health Organization classification of AML with mutated NPM1.\nDr. Newcomb: Induction chemotherapy with 7 days of cytarabine and 3 days of daunorubicin was administered. On day 34 after the initiation of chemotherapy, the absolute neutrophil count was 2.2 per microliter (reference range, 1.5 to 7.5), and the platelet count was 536,000 per microliter. A bone marrow biopsy performed on day 37 after initiation of chemotherapy revealed hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. There was no morphologic or phenotypic evidence of persistent or relapsed AML. A 300-cell sample of the bone marrow aspirate contained less than 1% blasts. Consolidation chemotherapy with four cycles of high-dose cytarabine was completed 8 months before the current presentation.\nDr. Crabbe: A bone marrow biopsy performed after the final cycle of chemotherapy revealed normocellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis; there was no morphologic or phenotypic evidence of AML. Next-generation sequencing of the bone marrow biopsy specimen revealed no pathogenic mutations.\nDr. Newcomb: The patient remained well for 7 months. One month before the current presentation, mild leukopenia developed, and more frequent laboratory monitoring was instituted. One week before the current presentation, the white-cell count was 2600 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 10,000), of which 13% were peripheral blasts. The patient was referred to this hospital for evaluation.\nOn presentation to this hospital, the patient reported a 3-week history of progressive fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, exercise intolerance, widespread muscle aches, and night sweats. He noted that similar symptoms had preceded his initial diagnosis.\nMedical history included obesity and hypertension. The patient was not taking medications on a regular basis. He was allergic to chlorhexidine, which caused rash. He lived in rural New England with his wife and four children. He worked as a software engineer. He did not smoke, and he drank alcohol rarely. His mother had coronary artery disease, and a sister had had a stroke. He had three other siblings who were healthy. There was no family history of leukemia or other hematologic disorders.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 35.7\u00b0C. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 43. No lymphadenopathy, rashes, or skin lesions were present. The remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 5830 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), of which 39.6% were blasts.

Silverman: A 68-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of worsening confusion.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. A myocardial infarction had occurred 18 years before the current admission; atrial fibrillation had also been diagnosed at that time. He had taken warfarin for many years but had stopped taking it 10 years before this admission.\nSeven and a half weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to another hospital with aphasia. His score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 3, with scores ranging from 0 to 42 and higher scores indicating greater severity. The score of 3 was due to partial loss of the right visual field and mild-to-moderate aphasia and dysarthria.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities. CT angiography of the head and neck revealed calcified atherosclerosis along the arch of the aorta, the origin of the left vertebral artery, the intracranial portion of the left vertebral artery, the carotid bifurcations, and the cavernous portions of both internal carotid arteries; there was no hemodynamically significant stenosis. Treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and the aphasia resolved on the second hospital day.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a few small foci of acute infarction involving the frontal lobes, the posterior limb of the right internal capsule, and the right middle cerebellar peduncle. There was also a small focus of remote petechial hemorrhage in the subcortical white matter of the left parietal lobe.\nAlthough continuous telemetry revealed no evidence of atrial fibrillation, the patient\u2019s strokes were thought to be cardioembolic, resulting from atrial fibrillation. Treatment with aspirin was continued, clopidogrel was discontinued, and apixaban was started; previously prescribed antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine and lisinopril was resumed. The patient was discharged home on the second hospital day.\nFour days after discharge, and 7 weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to the other hospital with transient mild aphasia. Results of CT of the head (performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material) and MRI of the head (performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material) were reportedly unchanged from the studies obtained 6 days earlier. The patient\u2019s systolic blood pressure was less than 100 mm Hg, and his symptoms were thought to be due to hypoperfusion or recrudescence of symptoms from previous stroke. Treatment with amlodipine and lisinopril was stopped, and the systolic blood pressure increased. The patient was discharged home on the fourth hospital day.\nThree weeks after discharge, and 3.5 weeks before the current admission, the patient\u2019s daughter noticed that the patient had confusion and lethargy, and she took him to the other hospital for evaluation. She reported that he had new urinary incontinence, unsteady gait, and withdrawn affect. MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new foci of acute infarction involving the centrum semiovale and corona radiata bilaterally.\nDr. Javier M. Romero: CT of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed diffuse emphysematous changes, including a spiculated mass (1.7 cm in diameter) with perilesional rectilinear markings in the lower lobe of the left lung. CT of the abdomen (Figure 1B) revealed an exophytic hyperdense mass (1.6 cm in diameter) arising from the anterior cortex of the left kidney.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Imaging Studies.\nDr. Silverman: On the fourth hospital day, the patient was transferred to a rehabilitation facility with plans for an oncology evaluation after discharge. After 10 days at the rehabilitation center, he was discharged home.\nThree days after discharge from the rehabilitation center, and 1 week before the current admission, numbness and tingling in the right hand and forearm developed, and the patient\u2019s daughter again took the patient to the other hospital. On examination, he had pronator drift of the right arm and dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing. MRI of the head revealed new foci of acute infarction involving the left thalamus, the subcortical white matter of the right frontal lobe, and the periventricular white matter on the left side, but there was no hemorrhage. Treatment with apixaban was stopped, and enoxaparin was started. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day.\nFive days after discharge, the patient\u2019s daughter noticed that the patient had new difficulty with swallowing pills and worsening confusion, and she brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient was not able to provide additional history, but his daughter reported that his aphasia and difficulty with balance had worsened since discharge from the other hospital. Other medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Medications included enoxaparin, aspirin, atorvastatin, and metformin. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburb of Boston and was retired. He had smoked cigarettes for 40 years, but he had recently decreased tobacco use from one pack per day to three cigarettes per day. He smoked marijuana occasionally, and he drank alcohol rarely. His father had had coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction in the fourth decade of life.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 158/75 mm Hg, the pulse 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.1. The patient was alert and interactive. He was able to answer orientation questions correctly, although he was slow to respond. His speech was fluent, with no paraphasic errors. He had some difficulty with following simple commands and was unable to follow complex commands. There was decreased activation of the right nasolabial fold with preserved wrinkling of the forehead. Pronator drift of the right arm was present, and there was mild hemiparesis on the right side. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nBlood levels of electrolytes and rheumatoid factor were normal, as were results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The hemoglobin level was 12.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5); the remainder of the complete blood count with differential count was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13). The d-dimer level was 912 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500). Urinalysis showed more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). A test for lupus anticoagulant was negative, as were tests for antibodies against cardiolipin and \u03b22-glycoprotein 1. Antinuclear antibodies were present at a titer of 1:160 in a speckled pattern. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Romero: CT angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1C), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed focal encephalomalacia within the left frontal corona radiata and right cerebral peduncle. Atheromatous changes had resulted in multifocal mild narrowing of the cervical and intracranial arteries. MRI of the head (Figure 1D and 1E), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed numerous new small foci of acute infarction involving the centrum semiovale and corona radiata bilaterally, the left thalamus, the left internal capsule and lentiform nucleus, the left subinsular region, the medial right precentral gyrus, the anterior right frontal lobe, the superior frontal gyri, and the right temporal lobe. There were also several scattered patches of increased signal intensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging and T2-weighted imaging, findings that are indicative of moderate small-vessel disease.\nDr. Silverman: The patient was admitted to the hospital, and intravenous heparin was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography performed on the second hospital day revealed a normal ejection fraction and no valvular vegetations or patent foramen ovale. Blood cultures showed no growth. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Paraneoplastic vasculitis of the central nervous system."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Natalie A. Diacovo (Pediatrics): An 11-year-old girl was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of redness of the eyes.\nThe patient had been well until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when she noticed mild eye redness, which was worse in the right eye than in the left eye. There was intermittent swelling of the eyelids but no photophobia, itching, pain, tearing, or discharge. The patient\u2019s parents administered naphazoline hydrochloride and glycerin eye drops, but the eye redness did not abate. When the eye redness had persisted for 2 weeks, the patient was taken to the pediatrics clinic of another hospital. She was given a 7-day course of an oral antibiotic agent as empirical treatment for possible preseptal cellulitis.\nFive weeks before the current evaluation, the eye redness persisted despite treatment, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital. The blood pressure was not measured during this evaluation. The visual acuity with correction was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination revealed abundant white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were also keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and rare iris nodules in the right eye. Funduscopic examination was notable for optic-disk swelling and peripheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes, as well as perivascular exudates in the right eye. Cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes were prescribed.\nDuring the subsequent 3 weeks, additional tests were performed in the pediatrics clinic of the other hospital. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, syphilis, and Lyme disease were negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was indeterminate. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

On evaluation, she described eye redness that had persisted but decreased in severity. She reported no fever, weight loss, night sweats, rash, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or joint pain. On examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 96/61 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.3.\nThe patient appeared well, with no oral lesions or rash. The visual acuity was unchanged. Slit-lamp examination revealed keratic precipitates and white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were extensive posterior synechiae in the right eye. Funduscopic examination (Figure 2) showed vitreous white cells, optic-disk swelling, perivascular exudates, peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nFIGURE 2\n\nFundus Photographs.\nDuring the next 4 days, additional tests were performed, and sputum specimens were obtained for an acid-fast bacilli smear and culture. Optical coherence tomography revealed optic-disk swelling but no cystoid macular swelling. Fluorescein angiography revealed optic-disk leakage with areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion and some vessel leakage.\nDr. Figueiro Longo: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1C), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed protrusion and enhancement of the optic disks and enhancement of the irises, a finding consistent with the clinical diagnosis of uveitis. There was no evidence of optic neuritis or perineuritis.\nDr. Diacovo: The administration of cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes was continued. Treatment with oral prednisone was started, and a regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was begun as empirical treatment for possible tuberculosis. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. She was instructed to follow up in the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital and was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the rheumatology clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient had had normal growth and development and was currently in middle school. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had emigrated from West Africa to the United States 6 years earlier; since then, she had lived with her mother and father in a suburban town in New England and had not traveled outside the region. Six months before this evaluation, an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for M. tuberculosis had been positive. At that time, the patient had received a prescription for a medication to treat latent tuberculosis infection; however, the patient\u2019s parents could not recall giving the medication to the patient. She was taking the prescribed cyclopentolate and prednisolone eye drops, oral prednisone, and regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient\u2019s parents were healthy.\nA diagnosis and management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Sarcoidosis"}, {"user_input": "Dr. Alexandra T. Lucas (Pediatrics): A 19-year-old man was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital because of shock, multiple organ failure, and rash.\nThe patient had been well until 20 hours before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed after he ate rice, chicken, and lo mein leftovers from a restaurant meal. Multiple episodes of emesis occurred, with vomitus that was either bilious or red-brown. The abdominal pain and vomiting were followed by the development of chills, generalized weakness, progressively worsening diffuse myalgias, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, neck stiffness, and blurry vision. Five hours before this admission, purplish discoloration of the skin developed, and a friend took the patient to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department of the other hospital, 4.5 hours before this admission, the patient reported diffuse myalgias that he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, he appeared pale, anxious, and moderately distressed; he answered questions appropriately and was oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, the pulse 147 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/124 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The oral mucous membranes were dry. On auscultation of the heart, tachycardia was present with a regular rhythm. The radial pulses were normal. The lungs were clear, without crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, without tenderness; the patient vomited yellow-green material during the examination. The skin was warm and dry and had a mottled appearance.\nBlood specimens were obtained and sent to the laboratory for culture, a complete blood count, and tests of renal function, liver function, and coagulation, as well as measurement of levels of electrolytes, glucose, lipase, lactic acid, and troponin. A urine specimen was sent for urinalysis and culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for influenza virus nucleic acid testing. Approximately 40 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, ondansetron, ceftriaxone, and a 2-liter bolus of 0.90% normal saline were administered intravenously.\nDuring the next 30 minutes, tachypnea worsened and labored breathing, hypoxemia, and cyanosis developed. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask, resulting in an oxygen saturation of 83%; then, oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 40 liters per minute. Intravenous doses of dexamethasone and vancomycin were given.\nDuring the following 40 minutes, the systolic blood pressure fell to 70 mm Hg and the dorsalis pedis pulses were noted to be weak. Approximately 110 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, a triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed in the right femoral vein and a continuous intravenous infusion of norepinephrine was initiated. After intravenous doses of midazolam, etomidate, and fentanyl were administered, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation with pressure-regulated volume control was begun, with a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of body weight, a rate of 24 breaths per minute, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm of water, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of 100%. A continuous infusion of propofol was begun.\nHypotension persisted, and a diffuse purpuric rash developed. Approximately 2 hours after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, a dose of piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered, a 1-liter bolus of 0.45% normal saline with 150 meq of sodium bicarbonate was given, and a Foley catheter was inserted. Twenty minutes later, a continuous intravenous infusion of phenylephrine was added, followed 7 minutes later by a vasopressin infusion. The patient was transported by helicopter to the PICU of this hospital.\nOn the patient\u2019s admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained from family members. A friend who had eaten the same meal as the patient the evening before admission had vomited once shortly thereafter but had not become progressively ill. The patient had a history of anxiety and depression, as well as intermittent ear infections during childhood. He had no known drug allergies. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. He smoked two packs of cigarettes weekly, smoked marijuana daily, and drank two alcoholic beverages approximately 2 times per week. He used dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine recreationally but did not use other illicit drugs.\nThe patient lived in northern New England with his mother, brother, and three cats but had been staying with a friend for 5 days before admission, during which time he had visited a beach along the ocean and a music venue. He worked part-time at a restaurant; he had not traveled recently or had any other exposure to animals or ill persons. His father had coronary artery disease, his mother had hypothyroidism, and his brother had had viral meningitis at 6 weeks of age.\nOn examination, the patient was pharmacologically sedated. The temperature was 40.8\u00b0C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/53 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was receiving mechanical ventilation with an Fio2 of 50%. He opened his eyes occasionally. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The femoral pulses were palpable, but the peripheral pulses were not palpable and the digits were cold. There was diffuse anasarca and oozing from venipuncture sites and from the site of central venous catheter insertion. A diffuse reticular purpuric rash was present on the face, chest, abdomen, back, arms, and legs, sparing the palms and soles (Fig. 1). A Foley catheter was in place, without urine output.

Nestor (Medicine): A 41-year-old woman with transient dysarthria and facial droop was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of masses on the mitral valve.\nThree weeks before this presentation, the patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital because of concerns about heavy vaginal bleeding that had developed 1 week earlier and was associated with crampy abdominal pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and lightheadedness. Examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/79 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 100% while she was breathing ambient air; the examination was otherwise reportedly normal, although a gynecologic examination was not performed. Laboratory results were notable for a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0; previous level 1 year earlier, 9.1), a mean corpuscular volume of 71.3 fl (reference range, 80 to 94), and a platelet count of 148,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Normal saline was administered intravenously, and a 5-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed.\nEleven days after the patient completed the therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate (9 days before this presentation), heavy vaginal bleeding and dyspnea recurred. An additional 3-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed. The evening after the patient finished the second course of treatment, within 1 hour after she had been seen and had appeared to be well, her husband noted that she had facial droop on the right side and slurred speech; he called emergency medical services. When she arrived at the emergency department of a second hospital, within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms, her examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 173/83 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 99% while she was breathing ambient air. She was noted to have facial droop on the right side and unintelligible speech.\nDr. Sandra P.

Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1; complement levels (C3 and C4) were normal. Additional cultures of blood were obtained.\nDr. Rincon: Repeat CT of the head revealed no acute abnormality. CT of the chest showed clustered nodules in the lower lobes that were probably related to aspiration, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2D, 2E, and 2F) revealed an enlarged heterogeneous uterus with multiple fibroids.\nDr. Nestor: The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On a review of systems, she reported no recurrence of dysarthria or facial droop and noted no other neurologic symptoms. She reported that she had had heavy menstrual bleeding and exertional dyspnea in the weeks preceding this presentation; pruritic, macular rashes on the trunk, scalp, arms, and legs with associated photosensitivity that had persisted for many weeks; new Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon in the past 10 months; and a long history of dry eyes and seasonal allergies. Medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, vitamin B12 deficiency, iron deficiency resulting in past iron infusions, uterine fibroids, anxiety, and hypertension. Surgical history included multiple laparoscopies and two laparotomies, including salpingo-oophorectomy for endometriosis. Owing to infertility, she had undergone in vitro fertilization; she had a first-trimester spontaneous abortion at 25 years of age. During her second pregnancy at 33 years of age, a screening rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was positive at 1:8; however, a treponemal-specific confirmatory test for syphilis was negative. Pregnancy-induced hypertension developed, followed by placental abruption at 30 weeks, which resulted in a cesarean delivery. Medications included amlodipine, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, and medroxyprogesterone acetate. She had no known medication allergies.\nThe patient lived in eastern Massachusetts with her husband and child. She did not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. Her mother had rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and a history of spontaneous abortion. One grandmother had diabetes and the other grandmother had had a stroke. An aunt had had leukemia and later breast cancer. Her child has psoriasis.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 155/98 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 175 cm, the weight 107 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 34.9. There were several small, circular macules on her back (Figure 3). There was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex. She had no lymphadenopathy, petechiae, nail changes, or evidence of arthritis. The remainder of the examination was normal, as was a neurologic examination.\nFIGURE 3\n\nClinical Photograph of Macules on the Back.\nLaboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Hofacker (Medicine): A 67-year-old man was admitted to this hospital with hypoxemia.\nSix years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated because of melena and anemia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed duodenal ulcers; biopsy of one of the ulcers revealed changes consistent with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a locally invasive mass in the head of the pancreas. A diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the duodenum was made, and treatment included chemotherapy, chemoradiation, and pancreaticoduodenectomy. Two months after the surgery, surveillance CT of the chest showed segmental pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe. Treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin was recommended, but the patient declined.\nDuring the next 5 years, surveillance CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed every 6 months. Six months before the current presentation, CT of the abdomen showed a new mass in the sigmoid colon with associated nodularity and lymphadenopathy. Colonoscopy revealed two fungating, nonobstructing, medium-sized masses, one at the ileocecal valve and the other in the sigmoid colon. Biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of mantle-cell lymphoma was established. The patient was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital, and plans were made for treatment with chemotherapy. Five months before the current presentation, pain in the right leg developed after a long car trip. Ultrasonography of the right leg revealed distal deep-vein thrombosis, and treatment with apixaban was initiated.\nNine weeks before the current presentation, cycle 1 of rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP) chemotherapy was administered, along with filgrastim. In addition, the administration of acyclovir and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was started for prophylaxis; however, rash developed on the trunk after 1 week, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was replaced with atovaquone for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.\nSix weeks before the current presentation, cycle 2 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was administered. Two days later, melena, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion developed. Laboratory testing revealed anemia (hematocrit, 26.8%; normal range, 41.0 to 53.0). The patient received 2 units of packed red cells, and fatigue and dyspnea resolved. Treatment with omeprazole was initiated. Four weeks before the current presentation, the administration of atovaquone was stopped because of the cost of the medication, and dapsone was started for prophylaxis against P. jirovecii pneumonia.\nThree weeks before the current presentation, cycle 3 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was administered. Ultrasonography of the right leg revealed resolution of the distal deep-vein thrombosis, and treatment with apixaban was stopped. Two weeks before the current presentation, fatigue and dyspnea on exertion recurred, but melena did not. Laboratory testing again revealed anemia (hematocrit, 28.7%), and the patient received 1 unit of packed red cells; fatigue resolved, but dyspnea did not.\nOn the day of presentation, the patient was evaluated before the administration of cycle 4 of R-DHAP chemotherapy. He reported ongoing dyspnea on exertion but no cough, fever, chills, chest pain, or orthopnea. He had been having loose stools since the pancreaticoduodenectomy. Other medical history included hypertension and hereditary spherocytosis, which had been treated with splenectomy. Medications included acyclovir, dapsone, lisinopril, and omeprazole. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole had caused a rash; there were no other known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol rarely; he had smoked tobacco for 2 years but had quit 20 years before this presentation. He was divorced, lived alone in a suburb of Boston, and worked as a lawyer.

T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed elevated signal hyperintensity involving the periaqueductal gray matter, dorsal midbrain, dorsal pons, superior and middle cerebellar peduncles, dentate nuclei, and cerebellar white matter (Figure 1B). There was obstructive hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Leptomeningeal enhancement was observed surrounding the brain stem and extending through the inferior aspect of the posterior fossa with entrapment of the fourth ventricle (Figure 1C). There was also leptomeningeal enhancement along multiple upper and lower cranial nerves.\nDr. Clark: Treatment with intravenous acetazolamide and oral dexamethasone was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the neurocritical care unit. On the first hospital day, the patient underwent stereotactically guided endoscopic exploration of the right ventricle. The right foramen of Monro was patent, but there was obstruction in the underlying third ventricle due to adhesions and aberrant anatomical features that precluded endoscopic third ventriculostomy. An external ventricular drain was placed; the opening pressure was 10 cm of water. Analysis of a CSF specimen obtained from the external ventricular drain showed 2 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 90% were neutrophils and 10% were monocytes, and 768 red cells per microliter (reference value, 0); the CSF levels of protein and glucose were normal.\nDexamethasone therapy was discontinued, and treatment with intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone was initiated. Airborne precautions were instituted, and an induced sputum sample was obtained for mycobacterial culture. No acid-fast bacilli were observed on examination of smears of three sputum samples obtained sequentially, and polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of one of the samples for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. CSF cultures were negative, and cytologic examination of the CSF did not show malignant cells.\nDr. Rohatgi: On the third hospital day, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. On the fourth hospital day, MRI of the spine revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, most notably in the lumbar spine, with masslike confluent enhancement filling the subarachnoid space at L5\u2013S2 (Figure 1F).\nDr. Clark: On the fifth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed; the CSF analysis revealed 1120 nucleated cells, of which 77% were neutrophils, and 23 red cells. The CSF protein level was 740 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the glucose level 19 mg per deciliter (1.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). The opening pressure was 10 cm of water relative to the external auditory meatus, which was the same as the pressure that was simultaneously recorded from the clamped external ventricular drain.

DuBois: A 29-year-old woman was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for the management of a soft-tissue mass in the head of the pancreas.\nThe patient had been well until 7 weeks before this presentation, when progressive pruritus throughout the body developed, along with nausea, bloating, and watery mustard-colored diarrhea. She had eaten sushi for dinner the previous night. She was evaluated in an urgent care clinic in the southeastern United States; she had recently moved there from New England. An injection of methylprednisolone was administered, and hydroxyzine and diphenoxylate\u2013atropine were prescribed. During the next 3 weeks, the symptoms did not abate and jaundice developed, along with new discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, decreased appetite, and amber-colored urine.\nFour weeks before this presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a local hospital. The alanine aminotransferase level was 327 U per liter (reference range, 1 to 33), the aspartate aminotransferase level 104 U per liter (reference range, 1 to 32), and the total bilirubin level 5.8 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.1 to 1.2).

The patient was admitted to the local hospital. On the second hospital day, results of liver-function tests improved, and she was discharged home with plans for an outpatient evaluation with a gastroenterologist.\nHowever, the next day, the patient flew back to New England and presented to the emergency department of a second hospital for further evaluation. On evaluation, she described persistent diffuse pruritus, nausea, right upper abdominal pain, and mustard-colored diarrhea. She also reported fatigue, unintentional weight loss of 3.2 kg during the past month, and poor sleep.\nThe patient had a history of anxiety and depression. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. Aside from her recent move to the southeastern United States and trip back to New England, there was no recent travel. She worked seasonally as an official at sporting events. She smoked cigarettes occasionally, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs. Her family history included colon cancer in her maternal grandmother, maternal grandfather, and paternal grandmother; breast cancer in her maternal aunt and paternal aunt; and thyroid cancer in her father. In addition, her maternal grandmother had diabetes, and both grandmothers had coronary artery disease.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 155/82 mm Hg, the pulse 94 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was thin and appeared jaundiced, with scleral icterus. She had diffuse excoriations from scratching. The bowel sounds were normal. There was mild tenderness in the right upper abdomen on palpation, but masses and hepatosplenomegaly were not detected. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe alanine aminotransferase level was 85 U per liter, the aspartate aminotransferase level 267 U per liter, and the total bilirubin level 6.7 mg per deciliter. The CA 19-9 level was 79 U per milliliter. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The abdominal CT images obtained at the first hospital were reviewed, and additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Avinash Kambadakone: CT of the abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed diffuse dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts, as well as dilatation of the pancreatic ducts. The dilated ducts terminated abruptly in the pancreatic head. There was a hypodense pancreatic mass at the site of duct obstruction. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (Figure 1C and 1D) also revealed dilatation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, which narrowed abruptly at the level of the pancreatic head, with a heterogeneously enhancing mass at the site of obstruction.\nFIGURE 1\n\nInitial Pancreatic Imaging Studies.\nDr. DuBois: The patient was admitted to the second hospital. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a stricture in the bile duct at the level of the mass, and a stent was placed. The bilirubin level initially decreased, but pruritus and diarrhea persisted. By the seventh hospital day, the bilirubin level had increased to 12.6 mg per deciliter and the CA 19-9 level had increased to 959 U per milliliter. Additional diagnostic testing was performed.\nDr. Kambadakone: Endoscopic ultrasonography (Figure 1E) revealed a hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic head. Fine-needle aspiration was performed.\nDr. DuBois: The aspirate showed variably atypical epithelium, but the quantity and quality of the findings were insufficient for definitive diagnosis. Given the uncertain diagnosis and the possibility of cancer, a surgical consultation was obtained. Surgical removal of the mass was recommended to establish the definitive diagnosis, but the patient declined surgery. Prednisone was administered, and the pruritus and diarrhea abated. On the 20th hospital day, the patient was discharged with plans for an outpatient follow-up evaluation with a gastroenterologist.\nThree days after discharge from the second hospital, the patient was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. At that time, her symptoms had resolved, the results of liver-function tests were normal, and the CA 19-9 level had decreased to 80 U per milliliter. IgG levels (total and subclasses) were normal, and tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were negative. The possibility of cancer was explained to the patient, and surgical removal of the mass was again recommended, but the patient declined surgery owing to multiple issues related to her work and personal life. A management plan that was acceptable to the patient was adopted during the next 6 months. The patient was closely monitored, and biliary stents were changed when they became occluded.

She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital and was discharged home after testing for kidney stones and appendicitis was reportedly negative.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, dyspnea with exertion and nonproductive cough developed. Six days after the onset of dyspnea and cough, the patient departed on a vacation cruise with her family. During the 8-day trip, dyspnea and cough worsened and prevented her from participating in activities such as swimming and hiking. By the end of the cruise, she had severe dyspnea with walking, and she required the use of a wheelchair during her trip home. After returning to Massachusetts, she presented to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation.\nThe patient reported ongoing cough and progressively worsening dyspnea but no chest pain or hemoptysis.

Point-of-care ultrasonography reportedly revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, marked aortic regurgitation, and a possible aortic-root abscess. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula. Treatment with intravenous furosemide, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin was started. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit of this hospital.\nOn arrival at the cardiac intensive care unit, the patient received bilevel positive airway pressure. A family member accompanying the patient provided additional history. The patient had had intermittent back pain beginning 6 months before the current presentation. Two months before the current presentation, she had had asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Five weeks before the current presentation, she had had a dental cleaning. During the cruise, the patient had two episodes of diarrhea without fever or chills; the family member did not know whether other persons on the cruise had been ill. The patient had told her family that she had noticed visible pulsations in her chest during the 2 weeks before the current presentation, and the family member reported that the patient\u2019s breathing had appeared labored while she was sleeping.\nOther medical history included anxiety and anemia. The patient took supplemental iron and had no known drug allergies. She did not use alcohol, tobacco, or other substances. She lived with her family in Massachusetts and worked in child care. There was no family history of cardiac or autoimmune disease.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure 145/58 mm Hg in the right arm and 136/65 mm Hg in the left arm, the respiratory rate 48 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving bilevel positive airway pressure (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.70). The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. While the patient was sitting in an upright position, she had increased work of breathing and intermittent cough. The heart rhythm was tachycardic, with a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the base and a grade 3/4 decrescendo diastolic murmur at the base that radiated to the apex, without an S3 gallop. Carotid and subclavian bruits were present. The jugular venous pressure was 8 cm of water. There were rales and decreased breath sounds in both lungs. Brachial, ulnar, radial, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses were symmetric. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, thyrotropin, lipase, human chorionic gonadotropin, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of liver function and kidney function. A urine toxicology screening test was negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 77 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the blood level of C-reactive protein was 147.8 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 1B through 1F and Videos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 34%. The aortic valve was tricuspid, without evidence of vegetation or aortic-root abscess, but there was incomplete closure of the aortic valve, which resulted in severe aortic regurgitation. The ascending thoracic aorta was dilated, measuring 44 mm in diameter, with thickened walls. The dilated left ventricle caused tethering of the mitral valve, which resulted in mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation and mild left atrial enlargement. There was a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of cardiac tamponade.\nFIGURE 1\n\nCardiac Studies.\nDr. Vinit Baliyan: CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 2) showed an irregular aortic contour with narrowing of the lumen in the vessels of the aortic arch and in the right renal artery. This imaging was performed with ECG gating, which allowed for the assessment of the aortic root. There was no evidence of a perivalvular abscess. However, circumferential wall thickening was present in the aorta at the root and in the ascending segment. In addition, there was circumferential wall thickening in partially visualized proximal vessels of the aortic arch and in the abdominal aorta. The mural thickening of the aorta showed enhancement that was suggestive of active inflammation; this enhancement was most visible in the abdominal aorta. Other findings included cardiomegaly with a markedly dilated left ventricle, alveolar pulmonary edema, a small pericardial effusion, and bilateral small pleural effusions.\nFIGURE 2\n\nCT Angiography of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.\nDr. Nestor: A diagnosis and management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Takayasu\u2019s arteritis."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Hamdja Moustafa: A 25-year-old pregnant woman presented to the emergency department of the Poli District Hospital in the North Region of Cameroon because of vaginal bleeding after a snakebite.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 hour before this presentation, when she was bitten by a snake while walking with her family. On presentation to the emergency department, she reported fatigue, dizziness, abdominal pain, and pain and numbness in her left lower leg.

Laboratory evaluation reportedly revealed elevated blood levels of anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies and rheumatoid factor, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed, but the patient chose not to begin specific therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Instead, she began taking selenium, cod-liver oil, and turmeric as home remedies for joint pain. Morning stiffness and joint pain resolved after 4 weeks.\nFour years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was started after the occurrence of another episode of morning stiffness and pain in the small joints of the hands. Three years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was stopped after melasma developed. Treatment with methotrexate was initiated, but morning hand stiffness and pain recurred; methotrexate was replaced with leflunomide, and the symptoms in the hands subsequently decreased.\nSix months before the current presentation, the patient began to have myalgia in the arms and thighs, as well as generalized fatigue. She had difficulty raising her arms above her head, and she could no longer independently brush her hair or apply makeup. Myalgia worsened with exercise and was worst at the end of the day.

The results of magnetic resonance venography of the head were normal.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated for a working diagnosis of optic neuritis. During the hospitalization, her ability to see colors improved slightly, but her vision did not improve; she could see only hand motions. On the fifth hospital day, she was discharged home with instructions to schedule follow-up appointments with a neurologist and an optometrist.\nOne month after discharge from the other hospital and 2 weeks before the current presentation, the patient was again evaluated by her optometrist. The vision in the right eye had worsened; she was no longer able to see shadows or movements. The patient was referred for evaluation by a neuro-ophthalmologist.\nOn the current presentation to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic of a hospital affiliated with this hospital, the patient reported no improvement in vision and ongoing soreness in the right eye. There was a history of Lyme disease, which had been diagnosed during the second trimester of pregnancy and had been treated with amoxicillin. Medications included prenatal vitamins and ferrous sulfate. The patient lived with her husband in New England and worked in health care. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. A brother had a history of childhood epilepsy, and her mother had macular degeneration.\nOn examination, the visual acuity was 20/15 in the left eye, and there was no light perception in the right eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, although the response in the right pupil was sluggish; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the right eye. On the Ishihara color test, all plates were identified with the left eye. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye. The Ishihara color test and the visual field test could not be performed on the right eye because of poor vision. The results of a slit-lamp examination were normal, with no cells identified in the anterior chamber or vitreous. On a funduscopic examination (Figure 1A and 1B), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had temporal pallor; there was a small area of hypopigmentation close to the macula in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed increased thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer and circumferential thinning of the ganglion cell complex of the right eye; no abnormalities were noted in the left eye.\nFIGURE 1\n\nFunduscopic Images.\nThe blood creatinine level was 0.56 mg per deciliter (50 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and the blood alkaline phosphatase level 147 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). The results of other kidney-function and liver-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, the complete blood count, and the results of coagulation tests. The blood C-reactive protein level was 15 mg per liter (reference value, <8) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 34 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). A blood test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern. Tests for antibodies against aquaporin-4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) were negative. A diagnosis of atypical optic neuritis was considered. Because the patient was near delivery, further treatment was delayed until after the birth of her child, which occurred 3 days later.\nSix days after delivery of the baby, the patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional studies were obtained. Lumbar puncture was performed. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, there were no nucleated cells, and the levels of protein, glucose, albumin, and IgG were normal. There was no oligoclonal banding after concentration of the CSF. Testing of the CSF was negative for syphilis antibodies and for antibodies against aquaporin-4.\nDr. Benjamin M. Kozak: MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed prominent fusiform enlargement of a segment of the intraorbital right optic nerve with associated enhancement, as well as associated hyperintensity on the T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence. There was no evidence of associated orbital edema or other orbital abnormalities. There was a punctate hyperintense focus within the left parietal subcortical white matter on the T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, without associated enhancement or restricted diffusion.\nFIGURE 2\n\nMRI of the Head.\nDr. Chwalisz: Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone and daily plasmapheresis was administered. On the fourth hospital day, the soreness in the right eye had resolved, and there was light perception in the right eye. On the fifth hospital day, treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was changed to oral prednisone. On the ninth hospital day, rituximab was administered, and the patient was discharged home with a prescription for a 7-week tapering course of prednisone.\nDuring the next 3 weeks, treatment with rituximab was administered weekly. Two weeks after the last rituximab infusion, the patient was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at the hospital affiliated with this hospital. She reported no eye pain and only occasional headache, but she noted that the vision in the right eye had worsened. Examination revealed no light perception in the right eye, with an afferent pupillary defect. The results of a visual field test and the Ishihara color test were unchanged from the previous evaluation in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic. On a funduscopic examination (Figure 1C), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had more pronounced temporal pallor; optociliary shunt vessels were also newly present. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Kozak: Follow-up MRI of the head (Figure 2) revealed no radiologically significant change in the segmental enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve, with persistent enhancement as well as hyperintensity on the T2-weighted STIR sequence. No new orbital abnormalities were present. In addition, the punctate lesion in the left parietal subcortical white matter was unchanged.\nDr. Chwalisz: A diagnostic procedure was performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Meningioma, meningothelial type, World Health Organization grade 1."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Nathan C. Praschan (Psychiatry): A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.\nFour months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.\nThree months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.\nOne month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed \u201cshaking and clenching\u201d movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.\nAt least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician\u2019s hand was placed on the patient\u2019s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient\u2019s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician\u2019s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.\nOn the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient\u2019s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 111/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.\nApproximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as \u201cpretty good\u201d and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.\nThe patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.\nBlood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\nA diagnostic test was performed.", "ground_truth_output": "Functional seizures."}, {"user_input": "Dr. Sunu S. Thomas: A 26-year-old pregnant woman was transferred to this hospital for evaluation and treatment of cardiogenic shock after a cardiac arrest resulting from ventricular tachycardia.\nThe patient had had two previous uncomplicated pregnancies and was currently pregnant at 32 weeks of gestation with monochorionic, diamniotic twins. Her pregnancy had been monitored for polyhydramnios by her obstetrician with the use of serial fetal ultrasonography.\nThree weeks before presentation to this hospital, one of the patient\u2019s preschool-age children had an ear infection and the other had a sore throat. The patient had erythema in the eyes with greenish drainage, for which topical erythromycin and sulfacetamide were prescribed. One week later, a nonproductive cough complicated by a sore throat and ear pain developed. The patient also noted new edema in her legs that was not associated with pain, redness, or warmth. However, during the subsequent week, progressive pain in her right leg occurred, which prompted her to seek care at an emergency department of another hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the pulse 113 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Pitting edema of the legs was noted, with no associated erythema, warmth, or tenderness on palpation of the calves. Ultrasonography of the right leg reportedly showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and a rapid test for streptococcal antigen was negative. While the patient was in the emergency department, painful uterine contractions with back discomfort developed; the cervix was 2 cm dilated. She was admitted to the labor and delivery unit for management of preterm labor. Intramuscular betamethasone and magnesium sulfate were administered for maturation of the fetal lungs and tocolysis, respectively. Continuous intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution was initiated. Subcutaneous heparin was not administered, because delivery was thought to be imminent. After 24 hours of magnesium sulfate therapy, the uterine contractions remained unchanged, and no further cervical dilatation was noted. Because of concern about preterm labor, she remained hospitalized, with continuous monitoring of the fetal heart rate.\nFive days after admission to the labor and delivery unit, the patient had tenderness in the left leg, and the edema in both legs had worsened. She also had episodes of severe coughing but reported no chest pain or shortness of breath. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/51 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed expiratory wheezes. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Doppler ultrasound examination of the legs revealed an occlusive thrombus in the left peroneal vein. The hematology service was consulted, and an intravenous heparin infusion was initiated. Intravenous furosemide and oral azithromycin and guaifenesin were also administered.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (First Hospital), 1 Day before Transfer (First Hospital), Day of Transfer after Cardiac Arrest (First Hospital), Reference Range (This Hospital), On Arrival (This Hospital)\n\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 11.2\u201315.7, 10.9, 11.0, 12.0\u201316.0, 9.6\nHematocrit (%), 34.1\u201344.9, 32.5, 33.1, 36.0\u201346.0, 28.2\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 132,000, 190,000, 150,000\u2013400,000, 158\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 3980\u201310,040, 8920, 12,670, 4500\u201311,000, 19,500\nDifferential count (per \u00b5l),\n\u2003Neutrophils, 1400\u20137700, 6333, 5448, 1800\u20137700, 16,302\n\u2003Lymphocytes, 1100\u20134000, 892, 3928, 1000\u20134800, 1014\n\u2003Eosinophils, 0\u2013700, 89, 127, 0\u2013900, 0\n\u2003Bands, 0\u20134, 714, 1140, 0\u20131100, 838\nSodium (mmol/liter), 136\u2013145, 135, 142, 135\u2013145, 143\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.5\u20135.1, 3.6, 3.8, 3.4\u20135.0, 4.0\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013107, 102, 108, 98\u2013108, 109\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 21\u201332, 20, 19, 23\u201332, 21\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 7\u201318, 9, 8, 8\u201325, 9\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.55\u20131.02, 0.57, 1.0, 0.60\u20131.50, 0.67\nGlucose (mg/dl), 74\u2013100, 98, 152, 70\u2013110, 202\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.1, 7.9, 7.5, 8.5\u201310.5, 6.7\nTotal protein (g/dl), 6.4\u20138.2, 4.9, 5.0, 6.0\u20138.3, 3.6\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.4\u20135.0, 1.9, 1.6, 3.3\u20135.0, 1.9\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 5\u201337, 26, 44, 9\u201332, 648\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 7\u201365, 25, 31, 7\u201333, 101\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 45\u2013117, 142, 141, 30\u2013100, 132\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.2\u20131.0, 0.59, 0.28, 0.0\u20131.0, 0.8\nMagnesium (mg/dl), 1.6\u20132.6, \u2014, 2.0, 1.7\u20132.4, 1.8\nProthrombin time (sec), 9.5\u201312.1, \u2014, 10.1, 11.5\u201314.5, 15.0\nInternational normalized ratio, 0.91\u20131.16, \u2014, 0.97, 0.9\u20131.1, 1.2\nPartial-thromboplastin time (sec), 23.9\u201331.3, \u2014, 73.8, 22.0\u201335.0, >150.0\nCentral venous oxygen saturation (%), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 70\u201380, 76.9\nPhosphorus (mg/dl), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 2.6\u20134.5, 4.1\nIonized calcium (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.14\u20131.30, 0.96\nGlobulin (g/dl), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.9\u20134.1, 1.3\nLactic acid (mmol/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.5\u20132.2, 1.3\nTroponin T (ng/ml), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, <0.03, 28.32\nCreatine kinase (U/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 40\u2013150, 11,012\nCreatine kinase MB isoenzyme (U/liter), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.0\u20136.9, 552.0\nFibrinogen (mg/dl), \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 150\u2013400, 259\nArterial blood gases:\n\u2003Fraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 1.0, \u2014, 1.0\n\u2003pH, 7.35\u20137.45, \u2014, 7.19, 7.35\u20137.45, 7.31\n\u2003Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 35\u201345, \u2014, 42.7, 35\u201342, 42\n\u2003Partial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 75\u2013100, \u2014, 251.9, 80\u2013100, 449\n\n\nThe next morning, after the patient had eaten breakfast, she had sudden severe, \u201ccrushing\u201d chest pain and became unresponsive and pulseless. Telemetry revealed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 178 beats per minute, with a right bundle-branch block pattern with a superior axis. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and after the administration of epinephrine and cardioversion, the return of spontaneous circulation was achieved within 4 minutes. Intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, propofol, and fentanyl were administered. The trachea was intubated, and ventilatory support was initiated. An emergency cesarean section was performed, and two healthy male infants were delivered, with an estimated intraoperative blood loss of 1600 ml. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Andrew S. Fox: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening, findings that were consistent with pulmonary edema; bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion; cardiomegaly with biventricular enlargement; and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery, which measured 3.8 cm in diameter. No pulmonary embolus was identified.\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies of the Chest.\nDr. Thomas: A transthoracic echocardiogram showed biventricular dilatation and severely decreased biventricular systolic function, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion. Furosemide was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to a nearby tertiary care center for further treatment.\nOn arrival at the second hospital, 210 minutes after the cardiac arrest, the pulse was 177 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure was 65 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. Physical examination was notable for diffusely coarse breath sounds, rapid regular heart sounds, and generalized edema. Thirty minutes after arrival at the second hospital, the patient underwent cannulation for femoral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and an intravenous infusion of milrinone was initiated. Ventricular tachycardia recurred; intravenous magnesium and lidocaine were administered, and the arrhythmia was terminated with cardioversion. Plans were made to transfer the patient by helicopter to this hospital, and intravenous vecuronium was given in preparation for transport. During the flight, severe vaginal bleeding developed, and 2 units of packed red cells were transfused; however, the heparin infusion was continued, given the presence of the ECMO circuit.\nOn arrival at this hospital, 10 hours after the cardiac arrest, additional information was obtained from the patient\u2019s sister and grandmother. The patient had a history of childhood asthma, obesity, anxiety, and depression. She had previously delivered two healthy, full-term children; her current pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus and polyhydramnios of one of the fetuses. Her medication history included insulin, inhaled albuterol, sertraline, iron sulfate, and folic acid. She had had no known adverse drug reactions. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was married and had two healthy preschool-age children, in addition to her two newborns. Her mother had died from ovarian cancer; her sister was healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the pulse 123 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure 76 mm Hg without intrinsic arterial pulsatility while the patient was receiving ECMO support. The respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was receiving oxygen through volume assist\u2013control mechanical ventilation, with a delivered tidal volume of 290 ml and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0. The weight was 105 kg, the height 163 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 39.5. The central venous pressure was 4 mm Hg. The pupils were equal and briskly reactive to light; once the patient was weaned off propofol, she was able to follow commands and move her arms and legs. Breath sounds were coarse bilaterally and diminished at the bases. Heart sounds were distant. The abdomen was soft and obese; no active bleeding was noted from the surgical incision, but large-volume vaginal bleeding and clots were observed. The arms and legs were warm and had moderate symmetric pitting edema. The femoral venous and arterial cannulas were secured in place in the right groin. The blood level of thyrotropin was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for influenza viruses, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus were negative.\nDr. Fox: Chest radiography (Figure 1C), performed at the time of transfer to this hospital, revealed interstitial opacities, a small left pleural effusion, and a dense retrocardiac opacity on the left side. The venous ECMO drainage cannula and a central venous catheter were visible in the right atrium.\nDr. Thomas: An electrocardiogram (Figure 2A) showed normal sinus rhythm, right bundle-branch block, borderline-low QRS voltage, and Q waves with T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads.\nFIGURE 2\n\nCardiac Studies.\nDr. Doreen DeFaria Yeh: Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 2B; and Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org), performed while the patient was receiving ECMO support, revealed a dilated left ventricular cavity with normal wall thickness and severe diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis that was most prominent in the anterior, anteroseptal, and lateral territories, with an estimated ejection fraction of 11%. Additional notable findings included moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, moderate right ventricular dysfunction and dilatation, an estimated pulmonary-artery systolic pressure of 53 mm Hg, a small pericardial effusion, and a pleural effusion. The ECMO inflow cannula was visualized in the inferior vena cava, and consistent with systemic ECMO blood flows, the aortic valve was observed not to open during the cardiac cycle, which suggested very poor native left ventricular contraction. There was no evidence of intracardiac shunting.\nDr. Thomas: The dose of milrinone was increased, and the dopamine infusion was discontinued. An oxytocin infusion and rectal misoprostol were administered. Ongoing large-volume vaginal bleeding was observed, and an intrauterine balloon was placed to control the bleeding.\nA diagnosis and management decisions were made.", "ground_truth_output": "Pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction, probably due to spontaneous coronary-artery dissection."}]
