# GitHub Workflow Guide

This document outlines the proper workflow for pushing changes to GitHub from this Replit project.

## Pushing Changes

1. Make your code changes in Replit
2. Use the `push_to_github.sh` script to safely push changes:
   ```bash
   ./push_to_github.sh "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```

## Security Considerations

- **NEVER** commit sensitive information like API keys or tokens
- Use environment variables or Replit Secrets for sensitive information
- The template file `gh_login.sh.template` is provided as a reference
- The actual `gh_login.sh` file is in `.gitignore` and should never be committed

## Troubleshooting Push Issues

If you encounter GitHub push protection issues:
1. Make sure you're not committing sensitive files
2. Check that `.gitignore` is properly configured
3. If needed, use `git filter-branch` to remove sensitive information from history
4. For persistent issues, consider creating a fresh clone without the problematic history
