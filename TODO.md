# ML Prompt Optimization Platform Implementation Plan

## Priority 1: Critical Issues
- [x] Fix syntax error in llm_client.py that prevents application startup
- [x] Fix syntax error with unexpected `else` statement in llm_client.py (line 175)
- [ ] Resolve gunicorn application startup issues
- [ ] Complete integration between Prefect flows and the main application
- [ ] Set up proper Prefect agent configuration and deployment
- [ ] Fix workflow scheduling and execution with proper error handling
- [ ] Ensure proper integration between Flask and FastAPI components
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling and logging across all components
- [ ] Address memory management in batch processing of large datasets

## Priority 2: Core Functionality
- [x] Complete basic 5-step workflow implementation
