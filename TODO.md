# ML Prompt Optimization Platform Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Structure Setup
- [x] Reorganize directories to match recommended structure
- [x] Create missing directories (src/, flows/, etc.)
- [x] Set up configuration file structure

## 2. Core Components Implementation
- [x] Create environment variables template
- [x] Implement Settings class with Pydantic
- [x] Develop PromptState model for managing prompt versions
- [x] Implement client interfaces for Vertex AI and Hugging Face

## 3. Prefect Flow Implementation
- [x] Install Prefect dependencies
- [x] Implement individual tasks for the 5-step workflow
- [x] Create main optimization flow with iteration logic
- [ ] Connect Prefect flows with existing application
- [ ] Set up proper error handling and retries in Prefect flows
- [ ] Implement artifact tracking

## 4. API Development
- [x] Set up FastAPI application structure
- [x] Implement API endpoints for prompts and workflows
- [x] Add request/response models using Pydantic
- [x] Create API router aggregation
- [ ] Implement proper API versioning
- [ ] Add comprehensive request validation
- [ ] Enhance error responses with more context

## 5. Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update existing UI to work with Prefect workflow
- [ ] Add visualization for tracking Prefect workflow execution
- [ ] Improve charts for metrics tracking
- [ ] Create experiment comparison views
- [ ] Add real-time progress indicators

## 6. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create unit tests for Prefect tasks
- [ ] Implement integration tests for the Prefect workflow
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for automated testing

## 7. Documentation
- [ ] Update README with new architecture details
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Add deployment instructions

## 8. Performance & Scaling
- [ ] Implement caching for API responses
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Optimize memory usage in batch processing
- [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring

## 9. Security
- [ ] Implement authentication system
- [ ] Add proper API key management
- [ ] Set up secure environment variable handling
- [ ] Implement input validation throughout the application

## Critical Issues to Fix
- [x] Fix syntax error in llm_client.py that prevents application startup
- [ ] Complete Prefect agent configuration
- [ ] Fix workflow scheduling and execution
- [ ] Ensure proper integration between Flask and FastAPI components
- [ ] Address memory management in batch processing
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Set up proper logging across all components
