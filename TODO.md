# ML Prompt Optimization Platform Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Structure Setup
- [ ] Reorganize directories to match recommended structure
- [ ] Create missing directories (src/, flows/, etc.)
- [ ] Set up configuration file structure

## 2. Core Components Implementation
- [ ] Create environment variables template
- [ ] Implement Settings class with Pydantic
- [ ] Develop PromptState model for managing prompt versions
- [ ] Implement client interfaces for Vertex AI and Hugging Face

## 3. Prefect Flow Implementation
- [ ] Install Prefect dependencies
- [ ] Implement individual tasks for the 5-step workflow
- [ ] Create main optimization flow with iteration logic
- [ ] Add logging and artifact tracking

## 4. API Development
- [ ] Set up FastAPI application structure
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for prompts and workflows
- [ ] Add request/response models using Pydantic
- [ ] Create API router aggregation

## 5. Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update existing UI to work with new API endpoints
- [ ] Add visualization for the 5-step workflow
- [ ] Implement charts for metrics tracking
- [ ] Create experiment comparison views

## 6. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create unit tests for core components
- [ ] Implement integration tests for the workflow
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Create test datasets

## 7. Documentation
- [ ] Update README with new architecture details
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create usage examples

## 8. Advanced ML Extensions (Optional)
- [ ] Implement meta-learning predictor
- [ ] Set up reinforcement learning agent
