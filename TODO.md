# ML Prompt Optimization Platform Implementation Plan

## Immediate Actions (Next 48 Hours)

### Critical Fixes
- [x] Fix syntax error in llm_client.py that prevents application startup
- [x] Fix syntax error with unexpected `else` statement in llm_client.py
- [x] Add missing `Field` import in PromptState model
- [x] Remove invalid `SequentialTaskRunner` import in Prefect flow
- [x] Implement ML settings API endpoints
- [x] Create database initialization script
- [ ] Update FastAPI-Prefect integration with proper error handling
- [ ] Improve memory management for batch processing

### Core Integration
- [ ] Complete Prefect agent configuration in `scripts/start_prefect_agent.py`
- [ ] Fix workflow scheduling and execution
- [ ] Update API endpoint handling for optimization jobs
- [ ] Add database persistence for ML settings

## Short-Term Goals (1-2 Weeks)

### Performance & Scaling
- [ ] Implement caching layer for API responses to reduce LLM API calls
- [ ] Add proper rate limiting for external API requests
- [ ] Implement backoff strategies for external API calls 
- [ ] Configure proper thread and process management for concurrent jobs

### Functional Improvements
- [ ] Implement cross-validation capabilities
- [ ] Create batch processing endpoints with progress tracking
- [ ] Add support for additional LLM providers beyond Vertex AI
- [ ] Implement proper event-based communication for real-time updates

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create unit tests for Prefect tasks
- [ ] Implement integration tests for Prefect workflows
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks

## Medium-Term Goals (3-4 Weeks)

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement secure environment variable handling for LLM credentials
- [ ] Add request rate limiting and abuse prevention
- [ ] Implement proper database access controls and data sanitization
- [ ] Set up audit logging for security events

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement reinforcement learning from user feedback
- [ ] Create prompt template library with categorized examples
- [ ] Add prompt version control with rollback capabilities
- [ ] Implement A/B testing for prompt variations

### Deployment & Operations
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards for system health
- [ ] Implement automated backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Create deployment pipeline with CI/CD integration
- [ ] Add performance profiling and optimization

## Implementation Status

### Components
- ✅ UI: Basic dashboard implementation complete
- ✅ UI: ML Settings pages created
- ✅ Core: 5-step workflow implementation
- ✅ API: Basic endpoint structure
- ✅ API: Authentication system
- ✅ Database: Schema design
- ⚠️ Integration: FastAPI-Prefect integration needs fixes
- ⚠️ Database: Persistence implementation incomplete
- ⚠️ Operations: Logging needs enhancement

### Next Steps
1. Complete backend API for ML settings with database persistence
2. Fix Prefect integration and workflow execution
3. Implement proper error handling and recovery
4. Add comprehensive test suite
5. Enhance security features
