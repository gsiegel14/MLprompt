    "user_input": "Dr. Andrew F. Cohen (Pediatrics): A 10-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of vomiting, weight loss, and hypercalcemia.\nThe patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when projectile vomiting began to occur once every few days, typically after eating solid foods. The vomiting did not seem to bother the patient, and he immediately returned to his normal activity after each episode. During the subsequent 12 days, the vomiting became more frequent, occurring daily, and had begun to occur after drinking liquids as well.\nTwo days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the pediatric primary care clinic of this hospital. On examination, the weight was 7.36 kg (0.4th percentile for his age) (Figure 1). The patient appeared alert, attentive, and comfortable but thin. The abdomen was soft, without distention or tenderness, and there was no evidence of organomegaly or masses on palpation. The skin was diffusely dry with excoriations. Treatment with omeprazole was started.\nFIGURE 1\n\nGrowth Curves.\nOver the course of the next 2 days, the patient lost interest in eating solid food and preferred milk and water. He gagged at the sight of food. The frequency of the vomiting had increased, occurring after the patient ate or drank anything.\nOn the day of this admission, the patient refused to take any food by mouth. His parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival, his parents reported that in the previous 2 weeks, he had had normal activity, wet diapers, and daily soft stools. They also noted that he always seemed thirsty, and when given liquid, he would drink a lot. At times, he would even suck the water out of the washcloths that were used to bathe him.\nThe patient had been born after induction of labor at 38 weeks\u2019 gestation owing to maternal gestational hypertension. He had received routine newborn care and met normal developmental milestones. He maintained normal growth for his age until an evaluation at 9 months of age, when the weight was 7.44 kg (1.6th percentile), and the body length was 68.2 cm (6.5th percentile) (Figure 1). At a routine evaluation when he was 6 months of age, the weight was 7.39 kg (27.1st percentile), and the length was 66.7 cm (43.1st percentile). The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and eczema. Medications included omeprazole; he was not receiving any vitamins or supplements. He had no known drug allergies, and immunizations were up to date.\nThe patient lived with his mother and father in a suburban area of New England. His father had GERD and melanoma, and cardiomyopathy had led to heart transplantation 9 years earlier. His mother was well. The patient\u2019s paternal grandmother had the Lynch syndrome and hyperparathyroidism. His maternal grandmother had diabetes and coronary artery disease, his maternal grandfather had hypertension and eczema, and his maternal uncle had the DiGeorge syndrome.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 102/78 mm Hg, the pulse 140 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute. The patient was alert and appropriately interactive. He appeared thin. The abdomen was soft, and there was no distension or tenderness. The muscle tone was normal.\nThe blood calcium level was 13.2 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiographs of the wrists and knees were normal. The dose of omeprazole was increased. Treatment with famotidine and intravenous fluids was started. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (This Hospital), On Admission, Hospital Day 3\n\nWhite-cell count (per \u00b5l), 6000\u201317,500, 17,030, \u2014\nHemoglobin (g/dl), 10.5\u201313.5, 12.3, \u2014\nHematocrit (%), 33.0\u201339.0, 37.4, \u2014\nPlatelet count (per \u00b5l), 150,000\u2013400,000, 494,000, \u2014\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 142, 142\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 4.2, 4.1\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013106, 104, 104\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 22\u201327, 22, 21\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 5\u201320, 16, 7\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.30\u20131.00, 0.34, 0.35\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 78, 87\nMagnesium (mg/dl), 1.7\u20132.4, \u2014, 2.4\nPhosphorus (mg/dl), 4.5\u20136.7, \u2014, 3.6\nCalcium (mg/dl), 8.5\u201310.5, 13.2, 12.2\nIonized calcium (mmol/liter), 1.14\u20131.30, \u2014, 1.47\n1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (pg/ml), 24\u201386, \u2014, 37\n25-Hydroxyvitamin D (ng/ml), 20\u201380, \u2014, 64\nThyrotropin (\u00b5IU/ml), 0.40\u20135.00, 1.92, \u2014\nParathyroid hormone (pg/ml), 10\u201360, \u2014, 6\nAspartate aminotransferase (U/liter), 9\u201380, 34, \u2014\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter), 10\u201355, 17, \u2014\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter), 122\u2013469, 190, \u2014\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dl), 0.0\u20131.0, 0.2, \u2014\nAlbumin (g/dl), 3.3\u20135.0, 4.6, \u2014\nGlobulin (g/dl), 1.9\u20134.1, 2.3, \u2014\n\nDuring the subsequent two hospital days, the patient was fed formula, and emesis continued to occur.

    "model_response": "Based on the presented case, here's a differential diagnosis focusing on the most likely causes of the 10-month-old's symptoms, prioritizing those supported by the available data:\n\n\n**1. Williams Syndrome (Hypercalcemia-related):**  This is the most likely diagnosis.  The constellation of symptoms \u2013 failure to thrive (despite initially normal growth), hypercalcemia, vomiting (projectile, worsening over time), polydipsia (excessive thirst), and ultimately nephrocalcinosis \u2013 strongly suggests Williams syndrome.  The relatively normal initial growth followed by a significant drop in weight percentile is also suggestive. While the family history doesn't explicitly mention Williams syndrome, the presence of hypercalcemia and the other clinical features make it the leading candidate.  The relatively low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level on hospital day 3, despite the hypercalcemia, further supports this, as Williams syndrome often presents with suppressed PTH due to the underlying mechanism of hypercalcemia.  The normal abdominal ultrasound and upper GI series rule out other common causes of vomiting and failure to thrive.\n\n**2. Idiopathic Hypercalcemia of Infancy (IH):** This is a less likely but still plausible diagnosis given the hypercalcemia and failure to thrive.  However, the additional features of nephrocalcinosis and the specific pattern of vomiting progression make Williams syndrome a more probable explanation.  IH typically presents earlier in infancy and may not always show nephrocalcinosis.  Further investigation would be needed to definitively rule this out.\n\n**3.  Other causes of hypercalcemia:**  While less likely given the clinical picture, other causes of hypercalcemia in infants should be considered, but are less probable given the other symptoms. These include:\n\n* **Primary hyperparathyroidism:**  Less likely given the relatively low PTH level on day 3, although this could be transient.  The family history of hyperparathyroidism in the paternal grandmother is a weak positive factor.\n* **Vitamin D intoxication:**  Less likely given the reported lack of vitamin D supplementation, although the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is slightly elevated.  Further investigation into the patient's actual vitamin D intake would be necessary.\n* **Granulomatous disease:**  Unlikely given the absence of other suggestive symptoms or findings.\n\n\n**Important Note:** The \"diagnostic test\" mentioned is not specified.  This is crucial information.  Genetic testing for Williams syndrome would be the next logical step in confirming or refuting the most likely diagnosis.  Further investigation into the patient's dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D is also warranted.  The relatively high white blood cell count warrants further investigation to rule out infection.\n",
