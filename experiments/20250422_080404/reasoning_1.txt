Analysis of Existing Prompts:
"output_prompt": "Analyze the provided medical case.  Present your analysis in the following structured format:\n\n1. **Summary of the Case:** Briefly summarize the key clinical findings and patient history.\n2. **Relevant Medical Knowledge:**  Identify the relevant medical concepts and principles applicable to this case.\n3. **Differential Diagnosis (if applicable):** List possible diagnoses, considering the presented information.  Explain the reasoning behind each consideration.\n4. **Necessary Information (if applicable):**  Specify any additional information needed to make a more accurate assessment.\n5. **Conclusion:** Summarize your analysis and state any limitations based on available information.",
  "reasoning": "The revised system prompt removes the overly verbose and potentially biasing introduction, focusing instead on clear, concise restrictions.  The emphasis is shifted from mimicking an expert physician to clearly defining the boundaries of acceptable input and output. The revised output prompt structures the response to encourage a more logical and systematic approach to medical case analysis. It prioritizes a step-by-step breakdown of the case, explicitly requiring justification for any differential diagnoses and identification of information gaps.  This structure promotes a reasoning-first approach over immediate answer generation, mitigating the risk of hallucination and improving the accuracy and reliability of the response. The changes are minimal but effective in improving the overall reasoning process by focusing on clear instructions and structured output."
