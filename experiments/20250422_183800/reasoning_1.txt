Analysis of Existing Prompts:
The current system prompt establishes a strong persona for the LLM, emphasizing expertise and meticulousness. However, it relies heavily on a lengthy list of restrictions, presented with examples, rather than incorporating these constraints directly into the core instructions.  This makes the prompt cumbersome and potentially confusing for the LLM. The few-shot examples within the system prompt are redundant as the output prompt already provides its own N-shot learning examples.

The current output prompt attempts to structure the response, but the structure is overly prescriptive and doesn't directly encourage the kind of step-by-step reasoning needed for complex medical diagnoses.  The N-shot examples, while well-structured, are also too long and might overwhelm the LLM, potentially leading to rote memorization rather than genuine reasoning.  The examples in the input demonstrate that the LLM struggles to synthesize information and apply its knowledge to reach a diagnosis; it tends to reiterate information rather than analyze it.  The root cause is the lack of explicit instructions to perform a structured diagnostic process.

The revised system prompt is significantly more concise.  It maintains the emphasis on expertise and precision but avoids the lengthy list of restrictions by stating a general principle: avoid any input that violates ethical or safety guidelines.  This allows for more flexibility while still maintaining the necessary guardrails.

The revised output prompt is more focused on guiding the LLM through a structured diagnostic process.  The five-step structure encourages a systematic approach: summarizing, generating a differential diagnosis, logically eliminating possibilities, arriving at a final diagnosis, and outlining a management plan.  This step-by-step approach directly addresses the reasoning deficiencies observed in the examples. The removal of the lengthy N-shot examples from the output prompt reduces the risk of rote memorization and allows the LLM to focus on applying its knowledge to new cases. The emphasis on justification at each step forces the LLM to articulate its reasoning process, making its thought process transparent and easier to evaluate.  This structured approach encourages a reasoning-first methodology rather than a pattern-matching or memorization approach.
