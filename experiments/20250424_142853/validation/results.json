    "user_input": "Dr. Beatriz Rizkallah Alves (Neurology): A 71-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital for neurosurgical evaluation because of confusion, aphasia, and a mass lesion in the brain.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current presentation, when headache and fatigue developed. The next day, she was typing on a computer at her workplace when she suddenly noticed that her typed words were incoherent. The episode of confusion and language production difficulties resolved after a few minutes. Confusion recurred in the evening while the patient was at dinner with her husband, and she sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Examination was reportedly normal.\nDr. Jeremy N. Ford: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, and CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed a large area of attenuation in the left posterior superior frontal lobe.\nDr. Alves: The patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nDr. Ford: On hospital day 2, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left frontal lobe with vasogenic edema and mass effect. A diagnosis of cancer with metastases to the brain was considered, and additional imaging studies were obtained. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly showed a pulmonary nodule that measured 0.2 cm in diameter and a nodule in the right breast that measured 1.3 cm in diameter. The appearance of the breast nodule was unchanged from that observed on imaging performed 8 years before the current presentation, except for the presence of a new punctate calcification along the anterior margin.\nFIGURE 1\n\nMRI of the Head Obtained on Hospital Day 2.\nOn hospital day 3, expressive aphasia developed. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly showed increased edema and mass effect that corresponded to the abnormality in the left frontal lobe.\nDr. Alves: Treatment with dexamethasone and levetiracetam was started. The patient received one dose of each medication before she was transferred to the neurosurgical unit of this hospital for evaluation and possible brain biopsy.\nThe patient had a history of myasthenia gravis, vitamin B12 deficiency, and hypertension. Surgical history included supracervical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine fibroids (performed 31 years before the current presentation), transsternal thymectomy and wedge resection of the right upper lobe for a cortical thymoma (22 years before the current presentation), and sigmoid colectomy for recurrent diverticulitis (7 years before the current presentation). Ocular-predominant myasthenia gravis was diagnosed 18 years before the current presentation and 4 years after thymectomy. Myasthenia gravis had been treated for 11 years with cyclosporine and pyridostigmine. Seven years before the current presentation, a flare of myasthenia gravis was complicated by respiratory failure, for which the patient received bilevel positive airway pressure and underwent plasmapheresis. After that hospitalization, cyclosporine therapy was replaced by mycophenolate mofetil, which she had been taking daily for the past 7 years.\nOther medications included cholecalciferol, latanoprost ophthalmic drops, hydrochlorothiazide, polysaccharide\u2013iron complex capsules, and monthly intramuscular vitamin B12 injections. Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate had previously caused rash. The patient lived in the northeastern United States, was married, and worked in an office. She had recently traveled to California for a wedding, and she reported no exposures to animals or fresh water. She had not had any recent dental procedures. She had no history of tobacco use or injection drug use. She rarely consumed alcoholic beverages. Her mother had systemic lupus erythematosus, and her father had lung cancer. A sister had rheumatoid arthritis.\nOn examination, the oral temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 150/80 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Severe expressive aphasia was observed, and she followed commands intermittently. Orientation could not be accurately assessed. She had disconjugate gaze at rest. Motor strength was 5/5 in the left arm and left leg and 4/5 in the right arm and right leg. The blood level of glucose was normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of phosphorus was 2.2 mg per deciliter (reference range, 2.6 to 4.5). The complete blood count was normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation.\nElectroencephalography showed intermittent irregular delta slowing focally over the left frontal region but no epileptiform abnormalities. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed ill-defined parenchymal hypoattenuation involving the left superior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and left centrum semiovale with associated sulcal effacement. Treatment with dexamethasone, hydrochlorothiazide, mycophenolate mofetil, and pyridostigmine was stopped, as was treatment with cholecalciferol, latanoprost drops, polysaccharide\u2013iron complex, and vitamin B12. Treatment with levetiracetam was continued, and empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin was started.\nDr. Gavin P. Dunn: A left frontal craniotomy with open brain biopsy was planned to allow for sufficient lesional tissue to be obtained and to enable further debulking to be performed, pending intraoperative findings and the results of pathological assessment. A small craniotomy centered at the coronal suture directly over the target lesion was performed. The lesion appeared gray, and tissue that appeared abnormal was sampled in several locations of the lesion. Direct microscopic visualization of the specimens identified areas that did not appear to be completely distinct from normal tissue, and thus, further debulking was not indicated. No purulence was noted.\nDr. Christopher W. Mount: Intraoperative examination of a frozen section (Figure 2) revealed a cellular infiltrate consisting of atypical cells in a focal perivascular arrangement. No evidence of pathologically significant acute inflammation was present in the tissue. At this time, these features suggested the presence of a malignant infiltrate. Additional specimens were submitted to the pathology department for formalin fixation and interpretation.\nFIGURE 2\n\nFrozen Section of Brain Tissue.\nDr. Alves: A diagnosis of lymphoma was considered, and treatment with dexamethasone administered intravenously every 6 hours was started. On postoperative day 1, new facial droop on the right side developed, along with weakness with cervical flexion and monoplegia of the right arm.\nDr. Ford: Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 3), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed postsurgical changes in the left frontal lobe and susceptibility artifact at the biopsy site that was consistent with blood products. There was enlargement of the expansile lesion in the left frontal lobe that corresponded to an area of hyperintensity on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging.\nFIGURE 3\n\nMRI of the Head Obtained on Postoperative Day 1.\nDr. Alves: A diagnostic test was performed.",

    "original_response": "**Case Discussion**\n\nA 71-year-old woman presented with acute onset confusion, aphasia, and a left frontal lobe mass.  Three days prior, she experienced headache and fatigue, followed by a transient episode of aphasia.  Subsequent episodes of confusion led to emergency department evaluation, initially with normal examination.  Neuroimaging revealed a heterogeneously enhancing left frontal lobe mass with edema and mass effect.  Further imaging showed a small pulmonary nodule and a previously stable breast nodule with new calcification.  The patient's history included myasthenia gravis treated with mycophenolate mofetil, vitamin B12 deficiency, and hypertension.  Surgical history included thymectomy, colectomy, and hysterectomy.  On examination, she exhibited severe expressive aphasia, intermittent command following, disconjugate gaze, and mild right-sided weakness.  Initial treatment included dexamethasone and levetiracetam.  Brain biopsy revealed a cellular infiltrate consistent with malignancy, prompting a diagnosis of lymphoma and intravenous dexamethasone. Post-operatively, she developed right-sided facial droop and arm weakness.  Repeat MRI showed lesion enlargement.\n\n\n**Most Likely Diagnoses**\n\n1. **Brain Metastasis**\n    - **Supporting Evidence:** The patient presented with acute neurological symptoms (confusion, aphasia), a mass lesion on imaging, and evidence of extracranial malignancy (pulmonary nodule and breast nodule).  The rapid progression of neurological symptoms and imaging findings strongly suggest a rapidly growing intracranial lesion.\n    - **Opposing Evidence:**  The exact primary tumor site remains uncertain.  Further investigation is needed to definitively identify the primary malignancy.\n\n\n2. **Primary CNS Lymphoma**\n    - **Supporting Evidence:** Brain biopsy revealed a cellular infiltrate consistent with malignancy, with a perivascular arrangement suggestive of lymphoma.  The patient's presentation with neurological symptoms and a rapidly growing mass supports this diagnosis.\n    - **Opposing Evidence:**  The presence of extracranial nodules raises the possibility of metastasis from another primary site.  Further immunohistochemical staining and genetic analysis of the biopsy specimen are needed to confirm the diagnosis of lymphoma and its subtype.\n\n\n**Expanded Differential**\n\n1. **Brain Abscess**\n    - **Supporting Evidence:**  The patient presented with neurological symptoms and a mass lesion.  Infection could potentially cause such a presentation.\n    - **Opposing Evidence:**  The absence of fever, leukocytosis, and purulence on biopsy makes a brain abscess less likely.\n\n\n2. **Glioblastoma**\n    - **Supporting Evidence:** Glioblastoma is a common primary brain tumor that can present with neurological symptoms and mass effect.\n    - **Opposing Evidence:** The biopsy findings are not consistent with glioblastoma.\n\n\n**Can't Miss Diagnoses**\n\n1. **Increased Intracranial Pressure**\n    - **Supporting Evidence:** The patient presented with neurological symptoms, mass effect on imaging, and edema.  These findings suggest the possibility of increased intracranial pressure.\n    - **Opposing Evidence:**  The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are more consistent with a space-occupying lesion than with isolated increased intracranial pressure.\n\n\n2. **Stroke**\n    - **Supporting Evidence:** The patient experienced transient neurological deficits, which could be consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.\n    - **Opposing Evidence:** The presence of a mass lesion on imaging makes a stroke less likely as the primary cause of her symptoms.\n\n\n**Diagnostic Next Steps**\n\n- **Complete immunohistochemical and genetic analysis of the brain biopsy specimen** to confirm the diagnosis of lymphoma and determine its subtype.\n- **Further imaging studies** (e.g., PET scan) to identify the primary tumor site if the brain lesion is metastatic.\n- **Repeat neurological examination** to monitor for changes in neurological status.\n- **Serial blood tests** to monitor for signs of infection or inflammation.\n- **Consult with an oncologist** to discuss treatment options.\n\n",
