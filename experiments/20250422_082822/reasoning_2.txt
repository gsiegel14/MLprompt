Failed to extract output prompt from response. Using original.
"The revised system prompt removes unnecessary verbosity and detailed restrictions, focusing on core principles of truthfulness and accuracy while maintaining safety guidelines implicitly. The revised output prompt adds a crucial instruction to provide step-by-step reasoning when necessary, thus directly addressing the lack of explicit reasoning guidance in the original prompt. This encourages a more transparent and logically sound response generation process, improving overall reasoning quality and reducing the likelihood of errors or hallucinations."
