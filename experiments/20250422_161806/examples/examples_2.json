    "model_response": "**1. Case Summary:** A 58-year-old woman presented with fatigue, abdominal bloating, and eosinophilia eight months after a leg injury sustained during a hiking trip in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  The injury required surgery.  Significant weight gain (13.6 kg since the injury) and worsening fatigue developed after the injury.  Laboratory results show persistent eosinophilia (though decreasing), elevated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibodies (IgG), and CT scan findings suggestive of granulomatous disease (calcified lesions in the lungs, liver, and spleen).  Tests for strongyloidiasis, syphilis, HIV, and Lyme disease were negative.\n\n**2. Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n* **Granulomatous Disease (e.g., Sarcoidosis, Tuberculosis):** The CT scan findings of calcified lesions in the lungs, liver, and spleen strongly suggest a granulomatous process.  The persistent fatigue and weight gain could also be consistent with this.\n* **Parasitic Infection:**  The patient's travel history to the ...",

    "model_response": "**1. Case Summary:** A 59-year-old man presented with a ten-month history of fever, chills, myalgias, night sweats, facial pain, and progressive neurological dysfunction.  Initial symptoms suggested a possible sinus infection, but symptoms progressed to include headache, jaw soreness, scalp tenderness, joint stiffness, weight loss, and diplopia.  Investigations revealed elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP, rheumatoid factor), and a temporal artery biopsy showed chronic inflammation and fibrinoid necrosis, leading to a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA).  Despite treatment with prednisone and tocilizumab, the patient experienced recurrent severe headaches, cranial nerve palsies, and meningeal involvement.  Further imaging revealed pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement in the head and cervical spine.  A meningeal biopsy revealed features consistent with IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD).  The patient received treatment with rituximab and dexamethasone, but continued to experien...",
