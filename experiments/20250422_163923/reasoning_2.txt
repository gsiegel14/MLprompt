Analysis of Existing Prompts:
The current system prompt is reasonably clear in its instructions but lacks specific guidance on the reasoning process.  It mentions "logical steps" but doesn't define what constitutes a logical step in this context. The output prompt provides a good structure, but the instructions within each section are still somewhat vague, leaving room for the model to jump to conclusions or hallucinate details. The examples demonstrate that the model struggles with connecting the presented symptoms to a differential diagnosis and justification. It tends to provide a narrative summary rather than a structured, reasoned approach. The root cause is the lack of explicit constraints on the reasoning process and the absence of prompts to break down the reasoning into smaller, manageable steps.  The model is not forced to explicitly state its reasoning for each diagnostic consideration.

The revised system prompt emphasizes the need for a clear chain of reasoning and explicit justification for each step. The revised output prompt adds more structure to each section, forcing the model to explicitly state its reasoning for each diagnostic consideration and management decision.  The addition of "Supporting Evidence" and "Refuting Evidence" sections in the Differential Diagnosis forces the model to engage in a more critical evaluation of the information provided, reducing the likelihood of hallucination and improving the accuracy of the diagnosis.  The added detail in the Diagnostic Approach and Management Plan sections ensures a more thorough and justified response.  These changes aim to guide the model towards a more structured and logical reasoning process, leading to improved accuracy and a better understanding of the model's thought process.  The changes are minimal but targeted to address the identified reasoning deficiencies.
