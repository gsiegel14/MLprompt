Failed to extract output prompt from response. Using original.
"The revised prompts improve reasoning by:\n\n1. **Simplifying the system prompt:** Removing unnecessary details and focusing on core instructions enhances clarity and reduces potential for misinterpretation. The restriction list is also streamlined for better readability and understanding.\n2. **Structuring the output prompt:** The numbered steps in the output prompt force a more systematic reasoning process, encouraging a clear presentation of the diagnostic thought process.  The explicit demand for showing work enhances transparency and accountability.\n3. **Removing examples:**  The original examples were overly specific and risked overfitting the model to those particular scenarios. The revised prompts focus on general principles of medical reasoning, avoiding the need for specific examples, reducing overfitting and improving generalization to unseen data. The emphasis on step-by-step reasoning and showing work will encourage more robust and reliable responses.  This approach promotes generalizable reasoning skills rather than rote memorization of specific cases."
