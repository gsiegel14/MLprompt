Marinacci: A 72-year-old woman was evaluated for dysarthria and respiratory failure during an admission to this hospital, which had occurred before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nTwo years before the current evaluation, the patient presented to her primary care physician at this hospital with subacute exertional dyspnea, which had been present for more than a year but had progressively worsened during the past several months. The oxygen saturation was 91 to 94% while she was walking. She had edema in both legs. The white-cell count, platelet count, and blood levels of electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, and hemoglobin were normal, as were test results for kidney function.\nDr. Sandra P. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and bilateral interstitial opacities.\nDr. Marinacci: Hydrochlorothiazide was prescribed. At a follow-up evaluation 2 weeks later, the patient\u2019s weight had decreased by 5 kg, but the exertional dyspnea and bilateral leg edema were unchanged. The N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide level was normal, and the d-dimer level was 3259 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500).\nDr. Rincon: Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no pulmonary emboli. A dilated main pulmonary artery, mosaic attenuation of the lungs, and coronary-artery calcifications were present.\nDr. Marinacci: Four weeks later, the patient presented to her primary care physician with increased exertional dyspnea. Her weight had decreased by 2 kg. The peak expiratory flow was 220 liters per second (expected value according to age, sex, and height, 350). A tapering course of prednisone and inhaled albuterol were prescribed, and her condition improved initially.\nThe patient was lost to follow-up; her next visit took place 10 months before the current evaluation. At that time, the patient reported recurrent exertional dyspnea, which occurred when she moved from room to room. She reported an episode of transient facial asymmetry with saliva dripping from the left side of her mouth that had developed while she was washing herself; later that day, her sister had noticed that she was slurring words during a telephone call. The white-cell count, platelet count, and blood levels of thyrotropin, glycated hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, and hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Furosemide was prescribed.\nTABLE 1\n\nLaboratory Data.\nVariable, Reference Range (Adults), 10 Mo before Admission (Outpatient Clinic), On Presentation (Emergency Department), Hospital Day 2, Hospital Day 3\n\nSodium (mmol/liter), 135\u2013145, 143, 139, 142, 142\nPotassium (mmol/liter), 3.4\u20135.0, 3.8, 4.7, 3.5, 3.4\nChloride (mmol/liter), 98\u2013108, 99, 98, 98, 94\nCarbon dioxide (mmol/liter), 23\u201332, 30, 22, 28, 32\nUrea nitrogen (mg/dl), 8\u201325, 29, 16, 17, 16\nCreatinine (mg/dl), 0.60\u20131.50, 0.89, 0.86, 0.83, 0.78\nGlucose (mg/dl), 70\u2013110, 171, 120, 110, 156\nN-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (pg/ml), <900, 1908, 2000, \u2014, \u2014\nHigh-sensitivity troponin T (ng/liter), 0\u20139, \u2014, 16, 18, \u2014\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/hr), 0\u201320, \u2014, \u2014, 39, \u2014\n\nVenous blood gas:\npH, 7.30\u20137.40, \u2014, 7.33, 7.33, \u2014\nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 38\u201350, \u2014, 63, 71, \u2014\n\nArterial blood gas:\nFraction of inspired oxygen, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 0.45\npH, 7.35\u20137.45, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 7.32\nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg), 35\u201342, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 74\nPartial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg), 80\u2013100, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, 89\n\nTwo months later, the patient presented to her primary care physician with throat pain and dyspnea that had been present for 3 weeks. An examination was notable for diffuse crackles in both lung fields.\nDr. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed pulmonary edema and a small right pleural effusion.\nDr. Marinacci: Intravenous furosemide was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal biventricular wall thickness, size, and function. Mild biatrial enlargement, a patent foramen ovale with mild left-to-right shunting, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg were noted.\nOn the day before the current evaluation, the patient called her primary care physician to report sore throat with difficulty swallowing that had started 2 days earlier. Because she had slurred speech over the phone, she was referred to the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported dysphagia with food, liquids, and medications. Her daughter reported that her voice had sounded \u201cgarbled\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d during the preceding days and also during an episode of transient dysarthria that had developed a few months earlier. Dyspnea and mild leg edema had been present for at least 3 years, along with some orthopnea and an intermittent nonproductive cough. The patient had started using a walker in the past year owing to exertional fatigue, arthritic pain, and weakness in both legs. Two falls had occurred in the previous 8 months. In addition, the patient reported increased generalized weakness and limb weakness, daytime somnolence, and fatigue. She had no diplopia, numbness, dizziness, headache, chest pain, palpitations, bleeding, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for severe obesity, coronary-artery calcifications, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial flutter, and hyperparathyroidism. Medications included furosemide, apixaban, aspirin, amlodipine, lisinopril, metoprolol, lovastatin, metformin, and sertraline. She had had no known adverse drug reactions. The patient was retired and divorced, and she lived alone in an assisted-living community. She had smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 15 years but had quit smoking 20 years earlier, and she did not drink alcohol or use other substances. Her family history was notable for ischemic heart disease. Her father had had myocardial infarctions; a paternal cousin had systemic lupus erythematosus.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 76 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/88 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 124 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 53.1. The patient was appropriately oriented, and her speech was fluent. She appeared to have increased work of breathing. The oropharynx was clear; no stridor was noted. Auscultation revealed an irregular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur at the base of the left sternal border and crackles in both lungs. The patient had pitting edema in both legs with venous stasis dermatitis and had tenderness of the knees with mild crepitus but no erythema or effusion.\nThe white-cell count, platelet count, and blood levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphate, creatine kinase, lactate, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, globulin, lipase, and hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 1+ protein. Testing of an oropharyngeal swab for group A streptococcal antigen was negative, and a throat culture showed no growth.\nDr. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, low lung volumes, and bilateral interstitial opacities (Figure 1A).\nFIGURE 1\n\nImaging Studies.\nDr. Marinacci: Electrocardiography was notable for atrial flutter with a ventricular rate of 75 beats per minute, a rightward axis, and low precordial QRS voltage. On the first night in the emergency department, the patient was unable to lie flat to sleep because of dyspnea. Intravenous furosemide was administered, along with continuous positive airway pressure (with a pressure of 10 cm of water and a rate of 4 liters of oxygen per minute). Cardiology and neurology consultations were requested.\nDr. Rincon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head and CTA of the head and neck showed chronic lacunar infarcts and chronic hypertensive microangiopathy (Figure 1B). No high-grade stenosis or large-vessel occlusion was noted. CT of the neck and mediastinum showed no mass or lymphadenopathy (Figure 1C).\nDr. Marinacci: On the second day, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of slurred speech, voice changes, and dyspnea. The examination was notable for tachypnea and a new onset of forgetfulness. The dysarthria was most pronounced with guttural sounds. She also had facial droop on the right side, subtle ptosis in the right eye, slight weakness in the proximal muscles on both sides, pronator drift on the left side, and the Babinski reflex in the right foot. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Rincon: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck showed findings similar to those seen on CT. No evidence of acute infarction was noted (Figure 1D). Scattered foci of susceptibility signal were present in the cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, and thalami, findings consistent with chronic microhemorrhages. MRA showed widely patent intracranial and cervical arteries (Figure 1E and 1F).\nDr. Marinacci: On the third day, the patient was somnolent and was using accessory muscles for breathing until bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated. An evaluation revealed weak cough and delayed swallow initiation. Owing to the degree of dysphagia, it was recommended that the patient avoid oral medications and food. The thyrotropin level was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Direct laryngoscopy showed an impaired swallow, normal vocal cords, and no mass or other source of obstruction. Intravenous furosemide and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam and inhaled ipratropium were administered.\nDiagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",

    "original_response": "Based on the extensive clinical presentation, imaging, and laboratory data, here's a differential diagnosis prioritizing the three most likely diagnoses:\n\n1. **Heart Failure with Pulmonary Hypertension and Neurologic Manifestations (Most Likely):**  The patient's long history of exertional dyspnea, leg edema, enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray, elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP),  dilated main pulmonary artery on CTA,  and evidence of right ventricular systolic pressure elevation on echocardiography strongly suggest heart failure.  The pulmonary hypertension is supported by the mosaic attenuation on CT and the right ventricular systolic pressure.  The recent onset of dysarthria, facial weakness, and cognitive changes point towards a neurologic complication likely secondary to hypoperfusion of the brain due to the severe heart failure.  The chronic lacunar infarcts and microangiopathy on neuroimaging are consistent with long-standing hypertension and likely exacerbated by the cardiac decompensation.  The elevated d-dimer initially was concerning for pulmonary embolism, but the CTA ruled this out.  The interstitial opacities on chest imaging are consistent with pulmonary edema associated with heart failure.\n\n2. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation with Right Heart Failure and Neurologic Event (Less Likely):** The patient's history of smoking, reduced peak expiratory flow, and diffuse crackles suggest COPD.  However, the prominent cardiac findings (enlarged cardiac silhouette, elevated NT-proBNP, right ventricular systolic pressure elevation, and pulmonary hypertension) overshadow the pulmonary component.  While a COPD exacerbation could contribute to the dyspnea and respiratory distress, it's less likely to be the primary driver given the overwhelming cardiac evidence and the neurologic symptoms.  The neurologic symptoms are less easily explained by COPD alone.\n\n3. **Stroke (Least Likely):** While the patient experienced transient facial asymmetry and dysarthria, the neuroimaging (CT and MRI) showed chronic, not acute, infarcts and microangiopathy.  The absence of acute infarct on MRI makes a recent large stroke less probable. The neurologic deficits are more likely a consequence of the underlying heart failure and chronic cerebrovascular disease, rather than a discrete stroke event.  The progressive nature of the neurologic symptoms also argues against a single, isolated stroke.\n\n\n**Important Note:** This is a differential diagnosis based on the provided information.  A definitive diagnosis requires a comprehensive assessment by a medical team, potentially including further specialized testing.  The patient's complex medical history and the interplay of cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic issues necessitate a multidisciplinary approach to management.\n",
