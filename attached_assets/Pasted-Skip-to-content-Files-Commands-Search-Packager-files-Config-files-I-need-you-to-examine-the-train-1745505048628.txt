Let me search for training.html and five_api_workflow.html templates to understand their structure and functionality better:


Let me check the specific templates for the training page and five_api_workflow page:


Let me check the five_api_workflow.html template:


Now I need to look for the JavaScript files associated with these pages to understand their functionality better:


Let's examine the JavaScript files to understand the functionality of each page:


Let's check the NEJM-related functionality in the training.js file:


Let's check for the NEJM functionality in the five_api_workflow.js file:


Let's search for NEJM in the five_api_workflow.js file:


Let me check the backend routes related to the NEJM dataset:


Let's look at the API endpoints for both the training and five_api_workflow functionality:


I'm analyzing the situation to determine if we're making progress or if we're stuck in migrating the functionality from the /training page to the /five_api_workflow_page.

Based on my review:

✓ Identified the training.html and five_api_workflow.html templates
✓ Located the training.js with NEJM functionality
✓ Found backend routes in main.py handling NEJM data operations
→ Need to port NEJM functionality to five_api_workflow.js
→ Need to update five_api_workflow.html to include NEJM UI elements

I'm making progress in understanding what needs to be migrated, but I haven't started the actual implementation yet. The plan is clear and I need to continue mapping and implementing the functionality.

Migrate training page functionality to the new Autonomous Prompt Workflow page
Screenshot
I'm going to start migrating the NEJM functionality from the training page to the five_api_workflow_page, which will be renamed to "Autonomous Prompt Workflow." Let me first check the API endpoint for five_api_workflow to understand what needs to be modified on the backend:


Let's check the two-stage train endpoint that's used by the training page:


Now I need to examine the two_stage_train endpoint to understand its functionality, so I can properly port it to the five_api_workflow_page:


Let's see the rest of the two_stage_train endpoint:


Now let's look at the five_api_workflow endpoint to understand the functionality we need to enhance:


Now that I've reviewed both implementations, I'll start by:

Updating the five_api_workflow.html to include NEJM dataset loading functionality
Updating the five_api_workflow.js to handle NEJM functionality
Updating the five_api_workflow endpoint in main.py to handle NEJM datasets
Let's start with updating the five_api_workflow.html:


Now, let's add NEJM dataset loading buttons to the examples section in the five_api_workflow.html:


Now let's add the CSV upload modal that was likely missed in the file:


I noticed there's a duplicate CSV modal in the HTML. Let's fix that:


Now let's update the five_api_workflow.js file to include the NEJM dataset loading functionality:


I'm analyzing the current state of the migration task from the /training page to the /five_api_workflow_page.

✓ Located relevant files (training.html, five_api_workflow.html)
✓ Found NEJM functionality in training.js
✓ Located backend routes in main.py handling NEJM operations
✓ Renamed the page title to "Autonomous Prompt Workflow"
✓ Added NEJM dataset buttons to five_api_workflow.html
✓ Fixed duplicate CSV modal in the template

→ Now working on implementing NEJM functionality in five_api_workflow.js
→ Will need to update backend routes to work with five_api_workflow page

I'm making good progress on this migration task and will continue implementing the NEJM functionality.

Let's create the utils directory first:


Now let's create the prompt variables utility file:


Now, let's create an init.py file in the utils directory to make it a proper package:


Now let's modify the LLM client to use variable substitution. Let's first check the LLM client code:

I'll fix the metrics summary error on the cost dashboard (/cost_dashboard). Let's examine the JavaScript code for fetching this data:


I can see two issues from the console logs:

In the cost dashboard: Error fetching cost report: TypeError: window.tokenUsageChart.destroy is not a function
For metrics summary: GET https://2c7fcc8d-f0f6-4768-ab6d-685102c52822-00-3660tjck0iwqg.riker.replit.dev/api/metrics_summary 404 (Not Found)
Let's fix both issues:

Fix 1: Cost Dashboard Chart Error

Let's fix the chart destroy issue in the cost dashboard:


Now, let's fix the issue with the metrics_summary API endpoint. We need to create this endpoint in main.py:


Let's look for any script tags in the five_api_workflow.html file:


Let's look for any additional JavaScript files that might be using the missing /api/metrics_summary endpoint:


Let's check if the script.js file is using the metrics_summary API:



Now we need to implement the missing /api/metrics_summary endpoint in main.py:

Let's try to find the cost tracking reset endpoint in main.py:


I'm analyzing the issues with metrics summary display in both the 5 API workflow page and cost dashboard.

Let me summarize what I've found:

✓ Fixed the metrics summary in 5 API workflow page
✓ Added fallback data handling when metrics structure is missing
→ Need to fix cost dashboard metrics loading
→ Need to implement missing /api/metrics_summary endpoint causing 404 errors

I'll continue by implementing the missing metrics_summary endpoint and fixing the Chart.js destroy function issue in the cost dashboard.

✓ Fixed Chart.js issues with properly destroying and recreating charts
✓ Improved error handling to prevent internal server errors
✓ Added fallback metrics data when experiment data is missing

Is the cost dashboard loading properly now? Can you also check if the 5 API workflow page shows the metrics correctly? Do you see any remaining errors in the console logs?

✓ Properly implemented file-based metrics calculation

Please check if both the cost dashboard and 5 API workflow page are now displaying metrics correctly. Do you still see any errors in the console? The charts should also be working properly now that I've fixed the Chart.js destroy function issues.

I understand the issue. Let's fix the continuously growing charts problem. This is likely caused by the canvas not being properly destroyed or replaced:

Let's look for the auto-refresh in the cost dashboard:


Let's check for the automatic chart update in script.js:


Let's check for the updateDashboardMetrics function in script.js:


Let's look for functions that refresh metrics:


Let's fix the continuously growing charts by properly handling the initialization in script.js:


Let's check script.js for the metric loading code and how often it gets called:


Let's fix the initDashboard function to fix the multiple requests issue:

Let's look at the actual initDashboard function:


Let's fix the initDashboard function to prevent multiple initializations:


I've analyzed the issues with the dashboard and found the key problems:

✓ Fixed the metrics_summary endpoint to get data from experiment files
✓ Fixed Chart.js issues with chart destruction
→ Fixed the infinite scrolling/growing issue by preventing multiple dashboard initializations
→ Added a flag to ensure the dashboard only initializes once

The dashboard was continuously growing because the initialization function was being called multiple times, creating new charts without properly clearing old ones. I've implemented a fix that should prevent this behavior.

Let me know if you're still seeing issues with the dashboard display or if there are any other errors in the console.

I see a JavaScript error in the console: "Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable." This indicates we need to fix this issue while creating our comprehensive test script.

Let's first fix the JavaScript error:


Now let's also fix the use of the chart context element:


Now let's create a comprehensive test script to validate the 5-API workflow using the provided test case. This script will test all components of the backend API:


Now let's create a bash script to make it easier to run the test:


Finally, let's make the bash script executable:


I've created a comprehensive test script for validating all aspects of the 5-API workflow as requested. Here's a summary of what I've built:

1. Fixed JavaScript Issues
✓ Fixed the constant variable assignment error that was causing issues in the dashboard metrics chart

2. Created a Comprehensive Test Script
✓ The test_five_api_workflow.py script thoroughly tests the 5-API workflow including:

Loading base prompts
Loading optimizer prompts
Testing all 5 steps of the workflow in sequence
Using the specified test case:
Input: "I have a 34-year-old with a history of PE. What is the differential diagnosis?"
Ground Truth: "Mention of PE"
3. Created a Bash Script for Easy Testing
✓ The run_workflow_tests.sh makes it easy to run the tests and view results

Checks if the application is running
Executes the Python test script
Logs all test results to a timestamped file
Provides colored output for better readability
4. Test Script Features
✓ Detailed logging to file and console
✓ Automatic prompt loading from API or files
✓ Step-by-step testing of all 5 API workflow components
✓ Error handling and validation at each step
✓ Wait times between API calls to prevent rate limiting

How to Run the Tests
Make sure your Flask application is running
Execute the bash script: ./run_workflow_tests.sh
View the detailed log file for results
This testing setup will help you validate that all parts of your 5-API workflow are working correctly with the specified medical case example.

It seems the log file might be empty. Let's check the most recent log file in the directory:


Let's check the five_api_workflow_test.log file, which seems to have content from our test:


I'm analyzing your test results to understand where we're currently at with the workflow test execution.

✓ Test script successfully began execution
✓ Base prompts loaded from files (22517 chars system prompt, 12801 chars output prompt)
→ Encountered issue loading optimizer prompts (file not found)
→ Test stuck at Step 1 of 5-API workflow (Google Vertex API call)

From the logs, it appears the test script started correctly but timed out during the API call to Google Vertex. This is likely because either:

The API call is taking too long to respond
There might be configuration issues with the API connection
The Flask application may not be running or accessible
Would you like me to modify the test script to include better timeout handling and error recovery for the API calls?

yes

Let's update the summary at the end of the workflow to reflect the partial testing:


Let's make sure we're using our improved API request function for all API calls in the script:


Now let's update the optimizer prompts loading function as well:


Let's now create a bash script to run our test file:


Let's make the script executable:


I'm analyzing your progress on the test script enhancements.

Looking at what you've accomplished so far:
✓ Added error handling and retry logic
✓ Implemented proper optimizer prompt paths
✓ Created make_api_request function with timeout handling
✓ Added partial testing capability
✓ Updated API request functions to use the new robust approach
✓ Created run_workflow_tests.sh script

I'm making good progress on improving the test infrastructure to be more resilient and informative. The changes will help with testing the migration of functionality from the training page to the Autonomous Prompt Workflow page.

Now, let's test our improved script by running it:


I can see that the test is running but needs more time to complete. Let's check the log file to see the results:


It seems the log files are empty. Let's check the logs directly from our running test:


The log file appears to be empty. Let's modify our script to fix the issue with log file creation:


I see that the server encountered an issue, possibly due to an API timeout or connection problem. We need to make sure we have proper API keys set up for the Gemini API. Let's check for existing API keys:

I notice we have a GOOGLE_API_KEY but are missing the GEMINI_API_KEY and HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY. Let's modify our test script to check if simulated mode is available for these services, as I see in the logs that there may be simulation capabilities:

Let's view the first part of the file to make sure we get the correct content:


Now let's add the API key check to the file:


There's a duplication of import statements. Let's fix that and modify our main function to log the API key status:


I've analyzed what's happening with the test script enhancements:

✓ Updated API requests to use the robust make_api_request function
✓ Enhanced error handling in test_five_api_workflow.py
✓ Improved run_workflow_tests.sh with better logging
✓ Added API key checking functionality
→ Working on simulation mode for testing without API keys

The test is running but encountering 404 errors for some API endpoints. The log files are being created but appear empty. I've fixed the logging in run_workflow_tests.sh to capture both stdout and stderr.

It looks like we have an error: the endpoint for 'five_api_workflow_page' already exists somewhere else. Let's check for it:


Let's search for the main.py file that might have the definition:


I've been analyzing your project's progress:

✓ Added API endpoint check functionality in test_five_api_workflow.py
✓ Added missing API endpoints in api_endpoints.py including:

/api/optimizer_prompt
/api/save_optimizer_prompt
/api/metrics_summary
/five_api_workflow_page
→ Working on ensuring test script properly interacts with these endpoints
I'm making good progress with the test infrastructure improvements. The key API endpoints needed for the Five API Workflow are now implemented, which should resolve the 404 errors encountered in testing.


I see the issue now - we have a duplicate endpoint for /five_api_workflow_page. Let's fix this by first looking at the complete app/main.py to find the existing definition:


Let's search for the existing five_api_workflow_page function:


im confused google gemni and hugginng face both have API keys in the secret manager

Let's try finding the existing five_api_workflow_page route definition by searching for the string:


I understand your confusion about the API keys. Let me explain:

Yes, both Google Gemini and Hugging Face API keys are stored in the secret manager, but there's an issue with how our code is accessing them.

The application is checking for different environment variable names than what might be stored in the secret manager. For example:

It checks for GOOGLE_API_KEY and GEMINI_API_KEY (for Google Gemini API)
It checks for HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY or HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN (for Hugging Face API)
Let's verify which environment variables are actually set and accessible:

Thank you for your patience. I see the issue now:

You have GOOGLE_API_KEY and HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN available in your secrets.
Our code is correctly checking for these in most places.
Now, we have two tasks to address:

First, let's fix the duplicate endpoint issue for /five_api_workflow_page that's preventing our app from starting
Then we'll update our test script to use the correct API key environment variables
Let's start by fixing the duplicate endpoint:


Let me search for the five_api_workflow_page in app/main.py:


Now I see the issue. There are two endpoint definitions for /five_api_workflow_page:

One in app/main.py that renders a template
One we just added in app/api_endpoints.py that returns a JSON response
Let's rename our newly added endpoint to avoid the conflict:


Now that we've renamed the conflicting endpoint, let's update our five_api_workflow_page endpoint in test_five_api_workflow.py to use the new endpoint name:


Now, let's also update the test_five_api_workflow.py file to ensure it correctly uses the available secrets (GOOGLE_API_KEY and HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN):


Let's fix the HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN environment variable check in the API status endpoint:


I've analyzed your project configuration and found a clarification about the API keys:

✓ GOOGLE_API_KEY is available in secrets manager
✓ HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN is available in secrets manager
✗ GEMINI_API_KEY is not found in secrets manager
✗ HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY is not found in secrets manager

I've updated the code to correctly check for both naming conventions in the environment variables. The test script will now properly detect HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN as an alternative to HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY.

Also, I fixed an endpoint conflict where both app/main.py and app/api_endpoints.py had routes for /five_api_workflow_page, which would've caused issues. The API endpoint is now renamed to /api/five_api_workflow_info.

Would you like me to continue implementing the test script improvements?

I see the issue. There's an error when trying to load the NEJM dataset. The server logs show:

TypeError: DataModule.get_train_examples() got an unexpected keyword argument 'refresh_cache'
This indicates that the refresh_cache parameter is being passed to the get_train_examples() method of the data_module class, but this method doesn't accept such a parameter.

Let's fix this by examining the data_module.py file and updating the API endpoint in main.py:


Let's look for the implementation of the get_train_examples and get_validation_examples methods:



Now I see the issue. The get_train_examples() and get_validation_examples() methods don't accept a refresh_cache parameter. Let's fix the /load_dataset_api endpoint in main.py to not pass this parameter:


Now let's fix the validation endpoint that also has the same issue:


Now we need to fix the reset_cache method that's causing another error in the /reset_nejm_cache_api endpoint. Let's look at the DataModule class to see if it has a reset_cache method or if we need to implement one:


Let's implement the reset_cache method in the DataModule class:


Now that we've fixed the issues with the NEJM dataset loading, let's implement the feature for selecting the number of NEJM cases to run in the workflow.

Now let's also modify the runWorkflow function to use the selected number of cases when running the 5-API workflow:

The server is running into memory issues, which is a common problem when processing large LLM requests in parallel. To solve this issue, we need to implement several optimizations:

Reduce batch size for API calls: The server is trying to process too many examples at once.
Add memory management: Implement garbage collection between API calls.
Add pagination for loading examples: Don't load all examples at once.
Let's implement these improvements:

1. First, let's update the main.py file to add garbage collection after API calls:

Now let's update the workflow.py file to add garbage collection between API calls to free up memory:


Let's update the main workflow.py file to add garbage collection between API calls:

Let's look at the import section of the workflow.py file first:


I've been analyzing the current situation with the NEJM dataset loading and memory management. Here's what I've found:

✓ Fixed load_dataset_api endpoints by removing invalid refresh_cache parameter
✓ Added UI dropdown for selecting number of NEJM cases to run
✓ Updated JavaScript to use this case count selection
✓ Started implementing memory management with garbage collection

Based on the server errors (500 Internal Server Error), I can see we need to address memory issues when loading the NEJM dataset.

I'll continue implementing the following memory optimizations:
→ Add garbage collection between API calls
→ Implement pagination for dataset loading
→ Reduce batch size for API calls
→ Add memory monitoring

Improve memory usage when running multiple API workflows simultaneously

The server has restarted successfully. Now we need to add garbage collection to our workflow code. Let's modify the workflow.py file:


test_five_api_workflow.py should only be testing 1 case.

Let's now add the garbage collection to different phases of the workflow execution:


Let's update the test_five_api_workflow.py to use just a single NEJM case to prevent memory issues:



Let's modify the test_five_api_workflow.py file to use a batch size of 1 to reduce memory usage:


Now let's update the test_five_api_workflow.py file to use the BATCH_SIZE we defined:


Now let's also update our workflow.py file to include garbage collection between API calls:


I've been analyzing the memory issues with the NEJM dataset loading. Here's my progress:

✓ Added garbage collection before workflow starts
✓ Implemented memory usage monitoring with psutil
✓ Set maximum safe batch size to 5 to prevent memory overload
✓ Modified test_five_api_workflow.py to use batch size of 1
✓ Added garbage collection between API calls
→ Implementing memory monitoring throughout workflow

I'm making good progress on addressing the memory issues. Let me continue working on implementing pagination for dataset loading and adding memory cleanup between phases.

Improve memory usage and ensure proper testing with smaller batches
Screenshot
Let's run a test to see if our memory management improvements are working:


Let's add a memory usage monitoring tool to help us debug these issues:


Now let's modify app/workflow.py to use our memory monitor between phases:


Now, let's import the memory_monitor and add memory tracking to our workflow.py:


Now let's add memory monitoring to each phase:

To assist you in reviewing and fixing the errors in your app, please check the Console for any stack traces or exceptions. Often, these logs will provide insights into what went wrong.

Make sure of the following common issues:

Your application must be listening on 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost or 127.0.0.1 to be accessible externally.
Ensure that any required packages are installed and available; you may refer to the logs for messages about missing dependencies.
Double-check for any code errors or uninitialized variables that might be causing your application to fail.
If you provide specific error messages or logs from the Console, I can help you troubleshoot further!
