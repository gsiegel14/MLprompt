Case 39-2024: A 30-Month-Old Boy with Recurrent Fever,"Dr. Vandana L. Madhavan: A 30-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital for the third time in 4 weeks because of recurrent fever.
The patient had been well until 4 weeks before the current presentation, when fever, dry cough, nasal congestion, and decreased intake of solid foods developed. The next day, while he was playing in a park with his siblings, he began limping. No trauma had preceded the onset of limping. The patient’s parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
The patient was afebrile. He was interactive but appeared tired and walked with a limp, favoring the left leg. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The white-cell count was 28,440 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 63 mm per hour (reference range, 9 to 14), and the C-reactive protein level 31.3 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0). Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for culture, and imaging studies were obtained.

Imaging Studies of the Chest and Abdomen.
Dr. Madhavan: The patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, he remained afebrile, had a normal energy level, and was walking normally. Blood cultures showed no growth. He was discharged home.
Two days after discharge, fever recurred. The patient’s mother brought him back to emergency department of this hospital. The patient was afebrile, but leukocytosis and elevated levels of inflammatory markers persisted. Tests of a nasopharyngeal swab were positive for coronavirus (not severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and for human rhinovirus and enterovirus. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was again obtained for culture, and additional imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Zucker: Ultrasonography of the abdomen (Figure 1B) revealed multiple hypoechoic splenic lesions, measuring up to 6 mm in diameter. No cholelithiasis, thickening of the gallbladder wall, or biliary ductal dilatation was present. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1C), abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, was notable for mediastinal lymphadenopathy mostly involving the paratracheal and subcarinal lymph node stations, as well as right hilar lymphadenopathy.
Dr. Madhavan: The patient was readmitted to the hospital. During the next 3 days, he had intermittent fever, which abated after the administration of ibuprofen. Blood cultures showed no growth. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was discharged home with recommendations for continued supportive care and instructions to undergo additional laboratory testing and imaging studies.
During the subsequent 3 weeks, the patient continued to have intermittent fever. On the day of the current presentation, planned outpatient laboratory testing was performed. The white-cell count was 42,390 per microliter, and the patient’s mother was asked to bring him back to the emergency department for evaluation.
The patient’s mother reported that the patient had fever once or twice daily. The episodes of fever were associated with chills, and the patient seemed averse to being held or touched. When he had no fever, he was playful and behaved normally. He had persistent dry cough, nasal congestion, and decreased intake of solid foods. There was no vomiting, diarrhea, or blood or mucus in the stool.
The patient had had normal growth and had met normal developmental milestones. He had iron-deficiency anemia. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies. Immunizations were up to date. His parents had immigrated to the United States from Central America. The patient and his siblings had been born in the United States, lived in a suburban area of New England, and had not traveled outside the region. His parents and older sister were healthy. One older brother had developmental delay and sensorineural hearing loss of unknown cause. Three and a half years before the patient’s current presentation, another older brother had received a diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection at 31 months of age.
On examination, the axillary temperature was 40.2°C, the blood pressure 131/61 mm Hg, the pulse 180 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 55 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was crying but consolable. Breathing was normal, without grunting or intercostal retractions, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There was palpable right axillary lymphadenopathy; he resisted examination of the left axilla. No cervical or inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted. No focal tenderness on palpation of the arms, legs, or joints was present, and there was no rash.
Dr. Zucker: Radiography of the chest revealed an opacity in the right lower lobe. Subsequent CT of the chest, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 1D), revealed multifocal pulmonary opacities with a basilar predominance in both lungs, along with lymphadenopathy that was relatively unchanged from that observed on previous CT imaging.
Dr. Madhavan: Administration of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula was initiated at a rate of 1 liter per minute. The patient was readmitted to the hospital.",Disseminated Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium abscessus infections due to mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease.
"Case 38-2024: A 22-Year-Old Woman with Headache, Fever, and Respiratory Failure","Dr. Kathleen M. McFadden (Medicine): A 22-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital in the summer before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic because of headache, fever, and respiratory failure.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 8 days before the current presentation, when nausea and myalgias developed. Over the next 2 days, chills, vomiting, neck pain, and headache with sonophobia developed. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital, where an evaluation reportedly showed dry mucous membranes but no signs of meningitis. The white-cell count was 12,300 per microliter (reference range, 4800 to 10,800), and the platelet count was 95,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Intravenous normal saline and morphine were administered, and the patient was discharged with supportive care for a presumed viral syndrome.
During the next week, the patient had worsening headache and new photophobia, as well as malaise, anorexia, nonproductive cough, and dyspnea with minimal exertion. Two days before the current presentation, the patient’s mother noticed episodes of confusion with nonsensical speech and excessive sleepiness, and she took the patient back to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported ongoing severe headaches and dyspnea. The temporal temperature was 38.0°C, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient had photophobia, but the neurologic examination was reportedly otherwise normal. She had mild throat erythema and diffuse abdominal tenderness with intermittent guarding. A urine test for beta human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained.
Table 1

Laboratory Data.
Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed subarachnoid hemorrhage and diffuse ischemic changes in the parietal and temporal lobes. Lumbar puncture was deferred because of thrombocytopenia. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed diffuse interstitial lung markings, multiple opacities and nodules in the peripheral lung, two hypodensities in the peripheral spleen, and subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and doxycycline was administered. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital.
The next morning, screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein–Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus were negative, as was a blood-smear examination for parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Platelets were transfused, and intravenous normal saline was administered. The respiratory rate increased to 45 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 93% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 8 liters per minute; ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure was attempted, and intravenous furosemide was administered. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole were discontinued, and empirical treatment with intravenous meropenem and clindamycin was administered. The patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital.
On arrival at this hospital, the patient had confusion and tachypnea and thus provided a limited history, but family members provided additional information. The patient had a history of depression, for which she received citalopram. She had no known drug allergies. She worked in health care. She drank wine socially, used electronic cigarettes, and occasionally smoked marijuana but did not smoke tobacco. Her most recent travel had been to the Caribbean more than 1 year before the current presentation. She had no exposure to wooded or rural areas. Her family had dogs, but she had no bites or scratches; she had no other animal or insect exposures. There were no recent sexual contacts. Her mother had cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and her maternal grandmother had Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 37.6°C, the heart rate 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 103/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 49 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 8 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22. The patient appeared to be in respiratory distress, with accessory muscles used for breathing. She was oriented only after prompting. She had meningismus and concomitant rigidity of the shoulders with passive range of motion, but she had no focal cranial-nerve, strength, or sensory deficits. Auscultation of the lungs and heart revealed diffuse rales and rhonchi, as well as a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur that was loudest at the apex and left axilla and radiated to the sternum. The spleen tip was palpable. A small patch of petechiae was present on the upper chest. The remainder of the examination was normal.
The blood levels of phosphorus, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; antinuclear antibodies were undetectable. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional blood cultures were obtained. Chest radiography showed diffuse lung opacities and pleural effusions on both sides. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia with normal intervals and nonspecific minor ST- and T-wave changes. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, doxycycline, and acyclovir was administered.
Four hours after admission, increased work of breathing, tachypnea, and confusion progressed, and the trachea was intubated for initiation of mechanical ventilation. Intravenous propofol, hydromorphone, and phenylephrine were administered. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, revealing mildly bloody and frothy effluent from all the lobes of the lungs. On examination of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, the nucleated-cell count was 375 per microliter, with 77% neutrophils. Gram’s staining showed no organisms. Tests for common respiratory virus — including influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses — were negative. A culture was also obtained.
Dr. Eric W. Zhang: CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral scattered curvilinear hyperdensities in the cortical sulci, findings suggestive of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (Figure 1A). There were also focal hypodense regions in the left superior parietal lobule and right temporal lobe with loss of normal gray–white matter differentiation, findings suggestive of acute cortical infarcts (Figure 1B). CT pulmonary angiography showed evidence of mild interstitial edema, bilateral pleural effusions, and multifocal peribronchovascular nodular opacities and consolidations involving all the lobes of the lungs, some of which were peripherally distributed, without cavitation (Figure 1C). CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed several splenic hypodensities, which were most likely splenic infarcts, with accompanying mild ascites and mild periportal edema (Figure 1D).
Figure 1

CT and MRI Images.
Dr. McFadden: Platelets were transfused, and lumbar puncture was performed, with an opening pressure of 38 cm of water. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, the glucose level was 41 mg per deciliter (reference range, 50 to 75), the protein level 31 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), the red-cell count 2400 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and the nucleated-cell count 49 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 76% neutrophils, 16% monocytes, and 8% lymphocytes.
Dr. Zhang: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed multifocal subarachnoid sulcal hyperintensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, findings that can be seen with subarachnoid hemorrhage or acute meningitis (Figure 1E). The focal hypodense regions in the left superior parietal lobule and right temporal lobe that had been noted previously on CT were associated with restricted diffusion on an apparent-diffusion-coefficient map (Figure 1F) and on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure 1G) from MRI of the head, which is compatible with bilateral acute cortical infarcts.",Infective endocarditis due to Haemophilus parainfluenzae.
Case 37-2024: A 41-Year-Old Man with Seizures and Agitation,"Dr. Lara Basovic: A 41-year-old man was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) of this hospital because of seizures.
When the patient was 4 years of age, his mother noticed an episode of staring and unresponsiveness. At 19 years of age, he was the driver in a single-vehicle accident in which the car rolled over. The patient did not recall the events or seek medical evaluation after the accident. Approximately 15 years before this admission, the patient received a diagnosis of epilepsy when episodes of staring to the left and unresponsiveness occurred. The seizures were preceded by a “bad feeling” in the epigastric region and were followed by confusion, agitation, or somnolence. An electroencephalogram (EEG) reportedly revealed bitemporal sharp waves, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head reportedly showed possible asymmetry in the temporal horns. The focal seizures initially occurred weekly and progressed to generalized tonic–clonic seizures. During the subsequent 15 years, the patient received treatment with various medications and adjusted doses of various antiseizure medications, and seizures occurred approximately once per month.
During the 3 months before this admission, the frequency of seizures increased to up to three times monthly, despite adherence to his prescribed medications, which included carbamazepine, levetiracetam, and topiramate. The patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of another hospital, and the doses of carbamazepine and levetiracetam were increased.
Four weeks before this admission, the patient had had five seizures in 2 weeks. Two weeks before this admission, coworkers witnessed shaking of his arms and legs and called emergency medical services. The patient was transported to the emergency department of the other hospital. He received a prescription for diazepam, which was to be taken as needed at night for insomnia, and was discharged home.
The next day, the patient’s neurologist was commuting to his office when he spotted the patient stumbling on the side of the road. The patient was behaving erratically and did not respond to questions or commands. Law enforcement was called, and the patient tried to run away. He was restrained and taken to the emergency department of the other hospital. The behavior and confusion resolved, and the patient was referred to the EMU of this hospital for additional evaluation.
On the day of this scheduled admission, the patient described stress at work, inadequate sleep, and adherence to his prescribed antiseizure medications. On a review of systems, he noted that he had had “blurriness” of memory for a few days after each seizure; however, he had been able to function well at work. He had no fever, chills, malaise, or headache. During the admission interview, the patient said that something strange was about to happen. His vision became blurred, and both thighs moved nonrhythmically. The patient was aware of these events and noted that they were not typical symptoms of his seizures.
The patient had no known medical problems other than epilepsy. Medications included carbamazepine, topiramate, levetiracetam, and cholecalciferol, as well as diazepam as needed for sleep. He had no known drug allergies. The patient was born in a Caribbean country and had moved to coastal New England 5 years before this admission to live with his mother and aunt. He worked as a skilled tradesman. He did not drink alcohol, use illicit drugs, or smoke cigarettes. His two sisters were healthy, and his maternal grandmother had Alzheimer’s disease. There was no family history of seizures or psychiatric disease. The results of a physical examination, including vital signs, mental status, mood, and affect, were normal.
Dr. Javier M. Romero: The initial MRI of the head revealed decreased volume of the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus with increased signal intensity on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging. Ex-vacuo dilatation of the left temporal horn was present, which was most likely secondary to the volume loss (Figure 1A). Interictal positron-emission tomography of the head was performed, which showed subtle reduction of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the left mesial temporal lobe (Figure 1B).
Figure 1

Initial Imaging Studies and EEG.
Dr. Basovic: During the patient’s first 3 days at this hospital, the doses of carbamazepine and levetiracetam were decreased gradually, and topiramate was continued. No electroclinical or electrographic seizures were observed (Figure 1C). During the fourth and fifth hospital days, the dose of carbamazepine was further decreased, and levetiracetam was stopped. A total of five seizures were observed, with staring and subtle movements in both legs that occurred for up to 3 minutes. EEG was performed, which revealed that most electroclinical seizure events originated from the left temporal lobe focus (Figure 2A); one event originated from the right temporal lobe (Figure 2B). After the second seizure, the patient tried to remove the EEG electrodes and leave the room. He bit and kicked the clinicians who tried to stop him. Security personnel were called, and intravenous haloperidol and lorazepam were administered. Between seizures, the patient was calm and cooperative without agitation. The dose of carbamazepine was increased.
Figure 2

EEGs Obtained during Hospital Course.
On the patient’s sixth hospital day, the blood pressure increased to 160/100 mm Hg, and the pulse increased to 120 beats per minute. Sixteen hours after the fifth seizure, he pressed the seizure alarm button three times during episodes of leg weakness and “foggy” vision. He answered questions with one-word answers and held his hand to his chest, saying that his heart felt “off.” He had auditory hallucinations of a keyboard playing and stated, “Please don’t fire those three girls.” Treatment with oral labetalol and lorazepam was started, and the dose of carbamazepine was further increased.
On the seventh hospital day, the patient dismantled a metal piece from the table in his room. He then held the door closed and refused to allow staff to enter and threatened them. When a staff member approached the patient, he struck that person with the metal piece. Security personnel were called, intravenous haloperidol was administered, and the patient was temporarily placed into four-point restraints. The dose of carbamazepine was further increased, treatment with levetiracetam was restarted, and risperidone was started.
The agitation resolved, and additional history was obtained. The patient explained his combative behavior by stating, “I thought they were trying to kill me,” and also said, “That’s not me.” He was concerned about the staff member who was struck and asked if that person was hurt. He had had no previous episodes of anger or violence, although he frequently had a feeling of fearfulness after seizures that made him want to be away from other people and on his own. He did not report auditory or visual hallucinations or paranoia, and he had never received a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder.
During the subsequent 3 days, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, and topiramate were administered at the preadmission doses, treatment with lorazepam was continued, and clobazam was started. He intermittently declined to take medications, especially the medications that were started in the hospital, such as labetalol and risperidone. Treatment with oral carbamazepine was transitioned to intravenous lacosamide. The patient had additional episodes of foggy vision, anxiety, restlessness, impulsivity, and agitation. He perseverated on the idea that God had saved him. He insisted that he needed to call his mother to tell her that “it’s the end.” He asked her for help because he believed he would be killed in the hospital. He was seen trying to eat a mobile telephone. Two-point and four-point restraints were placed intermittently.",Psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition (postictal psychosis).
Case 36-2024: A 16-Year-Old Girl with Abdominal Pain,"Dr. Mallory C. Mandel (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 weeks before the current presentation, when intermittent abdominal pain developed. During the next 2 weeks, the episodes of pain became more frequent, increasing from every few days to two times daily and lasting approximately 2 minutes. Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient had new nausea, and she vomited three times. She was not able to go to school, and her parents took her to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient described the pain as sharp and rated it at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain was worst in the epigastrium and in the upper quadrants of the abdomen. The temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 105 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry. She had diffuse abdominal tenderness with guarding on palpation of the epigastrium, left upper quadrant, and right upper quadrant. The white-cell count was 14,900 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000) and the hemoglobin level 11.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Qualitative urine testing for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative, and urinalysis was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis showed no abnormalities, although the appendix was not visualized. Oral acetaminophen was administered, as were intravenous ketorolac, famotidine, and ondansetron. The patient was discharged home with instructions to start treatment with oral famotidine, ondansetron, and ibuprofen.

During the next week, the patient continued to have intermittent episodes of abdominal pain and nausea, and she left early from school on two days because of pain. She took ibuprofen on one occasion, but the pain subsequently worsened; she decided not to take any additional doses. She did not take any doses of famotidine or ondansetron.
One week before the current presentation, abdominal pain woke the patient from sleep, and her parents took her to the emergency department at the other hospital. The mucous membranes were dry, and no abdominal distention or tenderness was noted. The white-cell count was 13,000 per microliter and the hemoglobin level 11.4 g per deciliter. Repeat ultrasonography of the abdomen and repeat transabdominal ultrasonography of the pelvis again showed no abnormalities. Screening tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia were negative. The patient was discharged home with instructions to start treatment with famotidine, ondansetron, and acetaminophen.
During the subsequent week, episodes of abdominal pain and nausea continued to occur. On the day of the current presentation, the episodes of pain lasted 15 minutes, and the patient vomited five times. Her parents brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
The patient described the episodes of abdominal pain as severe, occurring abruptly, and followed by nausea; when vomiting occurred, the severity of pain decreased. The pain was not related to menstruation, body position, time of day, or eating or drinking, although she noted that she had had decreased appetite. She had had fatigue, dizziness, and generalized weakness, as well as constipation that had worsened during the previous 2 weeks; the last bowel movement had occurred 3 days before the current presentation. There was no fever, diarrhea, or rash.
The patient’s medical history included iron-deficiency anemia and anxiety disorder; she had had pica as a toddler. She had normal growth and development and had received all childhood vaccinations. Medications included iron supplementation, oral contraception, and famotidine, as well as acetaminophen as needed for abdominal pain; she had not started taking ondansetron. She had no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her mother, father, sister, and dog in an urban area of New England. She attended high school. She was sexually active and had had two male partners; she used condoms consistently. She did not drink alcohol, use illicit drugs, or smoke tobacco; she had last smoked marijuana 4 weeks before the current presentation. Her maternal grandmother had peptic ulcer disease, her maternal grandfather had heart disease, and her father had depression and anxiety.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the heart rate 84 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 113/78 mm Hg. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The patient was actively retching during the examination. The mucous membranes were moist, and bowel sounds were present. The abdomen was nondistended, soft, and diffusely tender (predominantly in the epigastrium), and there was guarding without rebound. The rectal examination was normal, with no palpable stool in the rectal vault. The white-cell count was 15,720 per microliter and the hemoglobin level 10.8 g per deciliter. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The urine level of human chorionic gonadotropin was less than 6 IU per milliliter (reference range in nonpregnant adults, 0 to 6), and urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Ali Pourvaziri: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material and without the administration of oral contrast material, showed the gastric contents, a normal appendix, and no evidence of bowel obstruction. There was a small amount of solid stool in the ascending colon and sigmoid colon.
A mixture of aluminum hydroxide, diphenhydramine, lidocaine, magnesium hydroxide, and magnesium citrate was administered, but the patient vomited after taking these medications.",Trichobezoar
Case 40-2024: A 56-Year-Old Woman with End-Stage Liver Disease and Headache,"Dr. James Q. Zhou (Medicine): A 56-year-old woman with metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis and cirrhosis was admitted to this hospital because of end-stage liver disease.
The patient had been chronically ill and was healing from recent left hip surgery when new fatigue and abdominal pain developed 15 days before this admission. The patient did not take her routine, prescribed medications because of confusion. Thirteen days before this admission, when confusion prevented the patient from going to a scheduled appointment for therapeutic paracentesis, her husband took her to the emergency department of another hospital.
On evaluation, the patient reported abdominal pain and otherwise answered questions unreliably with one-word responses. She appeared jaundiced and was confused but oriented. Marked abdominal distention with bulging flanks and diffuse tenderness was observed. The left hip was bruised with a healing surgical wound with staples in place. Urinalysis was normal, and a urine toxicology screening was positive for opioids, oxycodone, and fentanyl, which had been prescribed. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Benjamin M. Kozak: Radiography of the chest showed elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, increased opacification of the right hilum, and linear opacities in the left lower lung. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a shrunken nodular cirrhotic liver contour and large-volume ascites; the gallbladder was surgically absent. Compression deformities of the lumbar spine, healed pubic rami fractures, and a left hip prosthesis were also noted. CT of the head revealed mild scattered hypodensities in the white matter, a finding consistent with chronic small-vessel disease.
Dr. Zhou: Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone was administered. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.
During the subsequent 12 days, lactulose and rifaximin were administered, and hepatic encephalopathy abated. Anemia worsened, and packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which reportedly revealed esophageal varices with evidence of previous band ligation and no active bleeding, as well as portal hypertensive gastropathy and erythematous duodenitis. Results of testing of the peritoneal fluid were not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ceftriaxone was stopped. Treatment with furosemide and spironolactone was administered, and three therapeutic paracenteses were performed. The renal function worsened, the administration of diuretic agents was stopped, albumin was given intravenously, and treatment with midodrine and octreotide was started. On hospital day 13, the patient was transferred to this hospital for additional management of end-stage liver disease and acute renal injury, as well as evaluation for liver transplantation.
On transfer to this hospital, the patient described nausea and increasing abdominal distention and discomfort. A review of systems was notable for headache, heartburn, and pain in the left shoulder and hip.
The patient had a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, anxiety, and depression. Migraines had occurred frequently in the past but had been rare after menopause. She had previously undergone a cesarean section, cholecystectomy, arthroplasty of the left shoulder, and recently, an open reduction and internal fixation involving the left femur. Medications included lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, ondansetron, pantoprazole, simethicone, insulin, gabapentin, duloxetine, and levothyroxine. Oxycodone and fentanyl patches started after the recent surgery were weaned and stopped, and the patient took acetaminophen as needed for pain. Treatment with azithromycin, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, and hydromorphone had caused nausea and diarrhea; metoclopramide, promethazine, and prochlorperazine had caused anxiety. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her husband and did not work because of medical disability. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit drugs.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 92/55 mm Hg, and the pulse 78 beats per minute. The patient appeared chronically ill and jaundiced and was alert and oriented. The abdomen was tensely distended, with a fluid wave and diffuse tenderness. She had no asterixis, and trace swelling was present in both legs. No rash was present. The neurologic examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with midodrine and octreotide was stopped, and treatment with terlipressin was started.
On hospital day 2, the patient noted that headache, which had been present since admission to the other hospital, had increased in severity. The pain, which she described as “throbbing and pounding,” was in the right frontal region and reminded her of previous migraines.
On hospital day 3, headache persisted, and the pain radiated to the back of her neck, which was not typical of her previous migraines. Butalbital–acetaminophen–caffeine was given, and a lidocaine patch was placed at the back of the neck; however, the pain did not abate after these treatments. On hospital day 4, nausea and abdominal distention increased, and therapeutic paracentesis was performed.
Dr. Kozak: CT of the head showed no changes from the previous imaging (Figure 1).
Figure 1

Initial CT of the Head.
Dr. Zhou: The administration of sumatriptan and intravenous magnesium and hydromorphone relieved the headache. However, on hospital day 5, headache worsened in severity throughout the day until the patient was tearful and rated the pain at 9 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She had new photophobia, and blurred vision developed in the right eye. Intravenous hydromorphone was administered, and she subsequently rated the pain at 6 out of 10.
A diagnosis was made.",Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.
Case 35-2024: A Newborn with Hypoxemia and a Lung Opacity,"Dr. Yanki Okuducu (Pediatrics): A newborn girl was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of this hospital because of cardiorespiratory arrest at delivery.
The newborn’s mother was a 19-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 1) with a history of hepatitis C virus infection. Pregnancy was complicated by urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection that was treated in the second trimester, as well as gestational hypertension. Serial ultrasound surveys of the fetal anatomy performed between 20 weeks 1 day of gestation and 39 weeks 6 days of gestation revealed dilatation of the urinary tract on the right side. Ultrasonography of the fetal heart was normal.
At 40 weeks 0 days of gestation, spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred, and the newborn’s mother was admitted to this hospital. Fetal heart tracings indicated nonreassuring fetal status, and at 22 hours 39 minutes of labor, a cesarean section was performed. The uterus was incised, and the amniotic fluid was noted to be stained with meconium. Six minutes later, the newborn was delivered; she was in a breech position at delivery. The birth weight was 3575 g (62nd percentile), the length 50 cm (42nd percentile), and the head circumference 35.5 cm (72nd percentile).
The newborn had limp tone and no respiratory effort. Ventilatory support was initiated, and the trachea was intubated. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed. Doses of epinephrine were administered through the endotracheal tube and an umbilical venous catheter, as were boluses of normal saline. After 16 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The Apgar scores at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes were 1, 0, 0, 1, and 3, respectively. The newborn was admitted to the NICU.
On the patient’s arrival in the NICU, the axillary temperature was 34.9°C, the heart rate 141 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 84/59 mm Hg. The oxygen saturation was 97% while she was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in pressure-control mode. A course of therapeutic hypothermia was initiated.
Dr. Evan J. Zucker: Chest radiography (Figure 1A) revealed a small-to-moderate pneumothorax in the medial aspect of the pleural cavity on the right side. Subtle lucency in the middle-to-lower thorax was present on the left side, a finding attributed to a possible left pneumothorax or air trapping.
FIGURE 1

Chest Radiographs.
Dr. Okuducu: Needle thoracentesis was performed on the right side, and 20 ml of air was removed. Empirical treatment with ampicillin and ceftazidime was started. On day 2, increased work of breathing developed, and additional imaging was performed.
Dr. Zucker: Repeat chest radiography (Figure 1B) showed resolution of the right pneumothorax and development of a large left pneumothorax with extensive collapse of the left lung. Needle thoracentesis was performed on the left side, and 27 ml of air was removed. Chest radiography performed after thoracentesis (Figure 1C) showed that the left pneumothorax had decreased in size and inflation of the left lung had increased.
Dr. Angela R. Shih: Pathological examination of the placenta revealed meconium-stained membranes. There was evidence of acute chorioamnionitis with fetal vascular involvement and bacterial organisms on and in the membranes.
Dr. Okuducu: During the next 2 days, the difference between the preductal oxygen saturation and the postductal oxygen saturation ranged from 5 to 15 percentage points, a finding suggestive of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. The fraction of inspired oxygen on the mechanical ventilator was increased to 1.0, and the administration of inhaled nitric oxide was initiated. Hypotension was treated with fluid resuscitation, and dopamine and milrinone infusions were started. Empirical treatment with vancomycin was also started.
On transthoracic echocardiography, biventricular systolic function was at the low end of the normal range, and the right ventricle was moderately enlarged. A patent ductus arteriosus (measuring 2.9 mm in diameter), a midmuscular ventricular septal defect (measuring 2.0 mm in diameter), and a patent foramen ovale (measuring 2.5 mm in diameter) were present; each of these features was associated with bidirectional shunting. Tricuspid regurgitation (peak gradient, 58 mm Hg; arterial blood pressure, 66/36 mm Hg) and ventricular septal flattening were present, findings suggestive of elevated right ventricular pressure due to pulmonary hypertension.
Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder revealed severe dilatation of the urinary tract on the right side; the left kidney was normal. The patient had an episode of rhythmic myoclonic jerking of the left leg that progressed to shaking of the left leg and arm, and phenobarbital was administered. Electroencephalography confirmed that a seizure originating in the midline posterior region had occurred. The seizure had lasted 25 minutes and had resolved spontaneously before the administration of phenobarbital. Ultrasonography of the head was normal.
On day 4, the patient completed the 72-hour course of therapeutic hypothermia, and rewarming began. The blood pressure decreased. The milrinone infusion was gradually discontinued, the dopamine infusion dose was increased, an epinephrine infusion was started, and hydrocortisone was administered. The newborn had episodes of agitation that were associated with labile oxygen saturation. Chest radiography showed that the left pneumothorax had continued to decrease in size; patchy opacities were seen throughout the right lung. Transthoracic echocardiography showed depressed right ventricular function.
During the next week, the pressor dose was increased. The periods of decreased oxygen saturation became more frequent and more prolonged, and ventilatory support was increased. On day 11, the oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in pressure-control mode (peak inspiratory pressure, 31 cm of water; positive end-expiratory pressure, 9 cm of water; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0), along with inhaled nitric oxide. Empirical therapy with vancomycin, ampicillin, and ceftazidime was stopped after the patient completed 10-day courses.
On day 16, the axillary temperature increased to 38.8°C. Chest radiography showed an opacity in the left lower lobe and a small left pleural effusion, as well as linear opacities in both upper lobes. Empirical treatment with oxacillin and gentamicin was started. On day 19, ventilatory support remained elevated, and empirical antibiotic therapy was transitioned to vancomycin and cefepime.
Dr. Zucker: On day 21, repeat chest radiography (Figure 1D) showed a persistent opacity in the left lower lobe. Empirical therapy with vancomycin was discontinued.
Dr. Okuducu: A diagnostic test was performed.",Intralobar bronchopulmonary sequestration.
Case 34-2024: A 69-Year-Old Man with Dyspnea after Old Myocardial Infarction,"Dr. Patrick Malecha (Medicine): A 69-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) was evaluated because of dyspnea during an urgent visit at an outpatient primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 days before the current presentation, when he felt unwell while working. He had dyspnea on exertion (while moving and stocking boxes and when walking home from work), with baseline exertional dyspnea that occurred after ascending two to three flights of stairs. The next day, the patient had palpitations and felt lightheaded throughout the day. The palpitations continued, and he was evaluated by his primary care physician at an outpatient primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital.
On a review of systems, the patient reported nausea with intermittent retching, anorexia (eating only a slice of cheese for the day), and fatigue. He stated that his right eye was “out of focus,” but he also noted that he had had this symptom in the past. He reported no chest pain or pressure. Although he had often had angina in the past, the patient noted that he had not had any episodes in the past 2 years and that he had had only one episode of substernal discomfort, which occurred while he was walking and had lasted 45 seconds. In addition, he had had no presyncope or loss of consciousness, ICD discharge, edema, orthopnea, paroxysms of nocturnal dyspnea, fever, known sick contacts, diarrhea, weight change, abdominal pain or bloating, dysuria, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, bleeding symptoms, or focal neurologic symptoms. He had not missed any doses of medications, and his last ICD check was 3 months before the current presentation.
The patient’s medical history was notable for premature coronary artery disease, with a first occurrence of myocardial infarction in his third decade of life. In his fifth decade of life, he had undergone coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) and subsequent stenting of the native left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary angiography, which was performed 2 years earlier for evaluation of angina, showed that the bypass graft and stent were patent but that severe native coronary disease was present (and was unchanged from an earlier study). The patient’s medical history also included ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronically reduced ejection fraction and scarring of the inferior and inferoposterior left ventricle, and ventricular tachycardia that had been treated with antiarrhythmic medication and an ICD. The ICD had been placed 3 years before the current presentation during an admission at this hospital for syncope that was followed by in-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia, which required multiple external defibrillations. Thereafter, the patient received treatment with oral amiodarone; however, device interrogation revealed intermittent ventricular tachycardia at rates of 109 to 117 beats per minute that persisted over the next 8 months, and he underwent endocardial ablation of ventricular tachycardia in the scar of the mid-inferior wall. Six months after ablation, he was readmitted to this hospital because of nausea and dizziness that were due to recurrent sustained slow ventricular tachycardia (110 beats per minute), for which he was treated with intravenous lidocaine and antitachycardia pacing.
In addition, the patient’s medical history included bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement concurrent with CABG, which had been complicated by prosthetic valve deterioration with mixed stenosis and mitral regurgitation, and culminated in transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement 2.5 years before the current presentation. He also had a history of hypertension, pulmonary embolism (4 years before the current presentation), iron-deficiency anemia, a colonic polyp, and prolonged encephalopathy after CABG. Medications included aspirin, coumadin, furosemide, metoprolol, lisinopril, dapagliflozin, ranolazine, atorvastatin, ferrous gluconate, paroxetine, and clonazepam. Treatment with amiodarone had previously been associated with elevations in liver-function test results. At the patient’s last office visit with an electrophysiologist 6 months before the current presentation, device interrogation showed no ventricular tachycardia and the heart rate was 60 beats per minute; treatment with amiodarone was discontinued.
Dr. Emily K. Zern: A transthoracic echocardiogram obtained at the same office visit with the electrophysiologist showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 31% with inferior, posterior, and apical territory dysfunction; right ventricular hypokinesis; a left-to-right interatrial shunt; trace-to-mild aortic insufficiency; a well-seated mitral valve prosthesis with no regurgitation and a mean transmitral gradient of 5 mm Hg; and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 31 mm Hg.
Dr. Malecha: At a primary care visit 5 months before the current presentation, the patient reported bloating. The heart rate was 62 beats per minute and the blood pressure 104/64 mm Hg. The thyrotropin level was normal, the N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level 646 pg per milliliter (reference value, <900), the hematocrit level 40.9% (reference range, 41.0 to 53.0), and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level 74 mg per deciliter (1.92 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 129 mg per deciliter [1.29 to 3.34 mmol per liter]).
The patient had had a routine office visit with his cardiologist 18 days before the current presentation, during which the heart rate was 63 beats per minute and the blood pressure 111/69 mm Hg; the weight was 83 kg. No changes were made to his medications.
Dr. Conor D. Barrett: An electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained at the visit with the cardiologist showed atrial pacing, first-degree atrioventricular delay, right bundle-branch block, and evidence of old inferior, apical, and posterior myocardial infarctions (Figure 1).
FIGURE 1

Initial Electrocardiogram.
Dr. Malecha: The patient was employed in multiple service jobs. He did not drink alcohol or use tobacco or other substances. He lived with several roommates on the fourth floor of an apartment building in an urban area and climbed stairs daily. His family history was notable for coronary artery disease in his father and stroke in his father, mother, and maternal grandmother.
At the current presentation, the temporal temperature was 35.7°C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute and regular, the blood pressure 84/59 mm Hg while the patient was sitting and 99/67 mm Hg while he was in the supine position, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83 kg. The patient appeared diaphoretic and clammy, and the skin was warm to the touch. He was alert, oriented, and lucid. The previous sternotomy and ICD sites were intact. There was no heart murmur; however, a possible S3 heart sound and minimal basilar rales were observed. The jugular venous pulse was difficult to visualize. A healed appendectomy scar was present, but the abdomen was nontender, the liver was nonpulsatile, and there was no fluid wave. The legs were warm with mild, symmetric pedal edema.
Laboratory test results were obtained 2 weeks before the current presentation. The sodium level was 139 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145), the potassium level 4.1 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.0), the creatinine level 0.91 mg per deciliter (80.44 μg per liter; reference range, 0.80 to 1.30 mg per deciliter [70.72 to 114.92 μg per liter]), the hematocrit 44.0%, the NT-proBNP 669 pg per milliliter, and the international normalized ratio (INR) 2.9 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1).
Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",Postmyocardial infarction (scar-related) reentrant ventricular tachycardia.
"Case 33-2024: A 71-Year-Old Woman with Confusion, Aphasia, and a Brain Mass","Dr. Beatriz Rizkallah Alves (Neurology): A 71-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital for neurosurgical evaluation because of confusion, aphasia, and a mass lesion in the brain.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current presentation, when headache and fatigue developed. The next day, she was typing on a computer at her workplace when she suddenly noticed that her typed words were incoherent. The episode of confusion and language production difficulties resolved after a few minutes. Confusion recurred in the evening while the patient was at dinner with her husband, and she sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Examination was reportedly normal.
Dr. Jeremy N. Ford: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, and CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed a large area of attenuation in the left posterior superior frontal lobe.
Dr. Alves: The patient was admitted to the other hospital.
Dr. Ford: On hospital day 2, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left frontal lobe with vasogenic edema and mass effect. A diagnosis of cancer with metastases to the brain was considered, and additional imaging studies were obtained. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly showed a pulmonary nodule that measured 0.2 cm in diameter and a nodule in the right breast that measured 1.3 cm in diameter. The appearance of the breast nodule was unchanged from that observed on imaging performed 8 years before the current presentation, except for the presence of a new punctate calcification along the anterior margin.
FIGURE 1

MRI of the Head Obtained on Hospital Day 2.
On hospital day 3, expressive aphasia developed. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly showed increased edema and mass effect that corresponded to the abnormality in the left frontal lobe.
Dr. Alves: Treatment with dexamethasone and levetiracetam was started. The patient received one dose of each medication before she was transferred to the neurosurgical unit of this hospital for evaluation and possible brain biopsy.
The patient had a history of myasthenia gravis, vitamin B12 deficiency, and hypertension. Surgical history included supracervical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine fibroids (performed 31 years before the current presentation), transsternal thymectomy and wedge resection of the right upper lobe for a cortical thymoma (22 years before the current presentation), and sigmoid colectomy for recurrent diverticulitis (7 years before the current presentation). Ocular-predominant myasthenia gravis was diagnosed 18 years before the current presentation and 4 years after thymectomy. Myasthenia gravis had been treated for 11 years with cyclosporine and pyridostigmine. Seven years before the current presentation, a flare of myasthenia gravis was complicated by respiratory failure, for which the patient received bilevel positive airway pressure and underwent plasmapheresis. After that hospitalization, cyclosporine therapy was replaced by mycophenolate mofetil, which she had been taking daily for the past 7 years.
Other medications included cholecalciferol, latanoprost ophthalmic drops, hydrochlorothiazide, polysaccharide–iron complex capsules, and monthly intramuscular vitamin B12 injections. Amoxicillin–clavulanate had previously caused rash. The patient lived in the northeastern United States, was married, and worked in an office. She had recently traveled to California for a wedding, and she reported no exposures to animals or fresh water. She had not had any recent dental procedures. She had no history of tobacco use or injection drug use. She rarely consumed alcoholic beverages. Her mother had systemic lupus erythematosus, and her father had lung cancer. A sister had rheumatoid arthritis.
On examination, the oral temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 150/80 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Severe expressive aphasia was observed, and she followed commands intermittently. Orientation could not be accurately assessed. She had disconjugate gaze at rest. Motor strength was 5/5 in the left arm and left leg and 4/5 in the right arm and right leg. The blood level of glucose was normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of phosphorus was 2.2 mg per deciliter (reference range, 2.6 to 4.5). The complete blood count was normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation.
Electroencephalography showed intermittent irregular delta slowing focally over the left frontal region but no epileptiform abnormalities. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed ill-defined parenchymal hypoattenuation involving the left superior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and left centrum semiovale with associated sulcal effacement. Treatment with dexamethasone, hydrochlorothiazide, mycophenolate mofetil, and pyridostigmine was stopped, as was treatment with cholecalciferol, latanoprost drops, polysaccharide–iron complex, and vitamin B12. Treatment with levetiracetam was continued, and empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin was started.
Dr. Gavin P. Dunn: A left frontal craniotomy with open brain biopsy was planned to allow for sufficient lesional tissue to be obtained and to enable further debulking to be performed, pending intraoperative findings and the results of pathological assessment. A small craniotomy centered at the coronal suture directly over the target lesion was performed. The lesion appeared gray, and tissue that appeared abnormal was sampled in several locations of the lesion. Direct microscopic visualization of the specimens identified areas that did not appear to be completely distinct from normal tissue, and thus, further debulking was not indicated. No purulence was noted.
Dr. Christopher W. Mount: Intraoperative examination of a frozen section (Figure 2) revealed a cellular infiltrate consisting of atypical cells in a focal perivascular arrangement. No evidence of pathologically significant acute inflammation was present in the tissue. At this time, these features suggested the presence of a malignant infiltrate. Additional specimens were submitted to the pathology department for formalin fixation and interpretation.
FIGURE 2

Frozen Section of Brain Tissue.
Dr. Alves: A diagnosis of lymphoma was considered, and treatment with dexamethasone administered intravenously every 6 hours was started. On postoperative day 1, new facial droop on the right side developed, along with weakness with cervical flexion and monoplegia of the right arm.
Dr. Ford: Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 3), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed postsurgical changes in the left frontal lobe and susceptibility artifact at the biopsy site that was consistent with blood products. There was enlargement of the expansile lesion in the left frontal lobe that corresponded to an area of hyperintensity on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging.

"Case 32-2024: A 72-Year-Old Woman with Dyspnea, Dysphagia, and Dysarthria","Dr. Lucas X. Marinacci: A 72-year-old woman was evaluated for dysarthria and respiratory failure during an admission to this hospital, which had occurred before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
Two years before the current evaluation, the patient presented to her primary care physician at this hospital with subacute exertional dyspnea, which had been present for more than a year but had progressively worsened during the past several months. The oxygen saturation was 91 to 94% while she was walking. She had edema in both legs. The white-cell count, platelet count, and blood levels of electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, and hemoglobin were normal, as were test results for kidney function.
Dr. Sandra P. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and bilateral interstitial opacities.
Dr. Marinacci: Hydrochlorothiazide was prescribed. At a follow-up evaluation 2 weeks later, the patient’s weight had decreased by 5 kg, but the exertional dyspnea and bilateral leg edema were unchanged. The N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide level was normal, and the d-dimer level was 3259 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500).
Dr. Rincon: Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no pulmonary emboli. A dilated main pulmonary artery, mosaic attenuation of the lungs, and coronary-artery calcifications were present.
Dr. Marinacci: Four weeks later, the patient presented to her primary care physician with increased exertional dyspnea. Her weight had decreased by 2 kg. The peak expiratory flow was 220 liters per second (expected value according to age, sex, and height, 350). A tapering course of prednisone and inhaled albuterol were prescribed, and her condition improved initially.
The patient was lost to follow-up; her next visit took place 10 months before the current evaluation. At that time, the patient reported recurrent exertional dyspnea, which occurred when she moved from room to room. She reported an episode of transient facial asymmetry with saliva dripping from the left side of her mouth that had developed while she was washing herself; later that day, her sister had noticed that she was slurring words during a telephone call. The white-cell count, platelet count, and blood levels of thyrotropin, glycated hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, and hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Furosemide was prescribed.

Two months later, the patient presented to her primary care physician with throat pain and dyspnea that had been present for 3 weeks. An examination was notable for diffuse crackles in both lung fields.
Dr. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed pulmonary edema and a small right pleural effusion.
Dr. Marinacci: Intravenous furosemide was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal biventricular wall thickness, size, and function. Mild biatrial enlargement, a patent foramen ovale with mild left-to-right shunting, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg were noted.
On the day before the current evaluation, the patient called her primary care physician to report sore throat with difficulty swallowing that had started 2 days earlier. Because she had slurred speech over the phone, she was referred to the emergency department of this hospital.
In the emergency department, the patient reported dysphagia with food, liquids, and medications. Her daughter reported that her voice had sounded “garbled” and “soft” during the preceding days and also during an episode of transient dysarthria that had developed a few months earlier. Dyspnea and mild leg edema had been present for at least 3 years, along with some orthopnea and an intermittent nonproductive cough. The patient had started using a walker in the past year owing to exertional fatigue, arthritic pain, and weakness in both legs. Two falls had occurred in the previous 8 months. In addition, the patient reported increased generalized weakness and limb weakness, daytime somnolence, and fatigue. She had no diplopia, numbness, dizziness, headache, chest pain, palpitations, bleeding, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms.
The patient’s medical history was notable for severe obesity, coronary-artery calcifications, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial flutter, and hyperparathyroidism. Medications included furosemide, apixaban, aspirin, amlodipine, lisinopril, metoprolol, lovastatin, metformin, and sertraline. She had had no known adverse drug reactions. The patient was retired and divorced, and she lived alone in an assisted-living community. She had smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 15 years but had quit smoking 20 years earlier, and she did not drink alcohol or use other substances. Her family history was notable for ischemic heart disease. Her father had had myocardial infarctions; a paternal cousin had systemic lupus erythematosus.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2°C, the heart rate 76 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/88 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 124 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 53.1. The patient was appropriately oriented, and her speech was fluent. She appeared to have increased work of breathing. The oropharynx was clear; no stridor was noted. Auscultation revealed an irregular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur at the base of the left sternal border and crackles in both lungs. The patient had pitting edema in both legs with venous stasis dermatitis and had tenderness of the knees with mild crepitus but no erythema or effusion.
The white-cell count, platelet count, and blood levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphate, creatine kinase, lactate, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, globulin, lipase, and hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 1+ protein. Testing of an oropharyngeal swab for group A streptococcal antigen was negative, and a throat culture showed no growth.
Dr. Rincon: A chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, low lung volumes, and bilateral interstitial opacities (Figure 1A).
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Marinacci: Electrocardiography was notable for atrial flutter with a ventricular rate of 75 beats per minute, a rightward axis, and low precordial QRS voltage. On the first night in the emergency department, the patient was unable to lie flat to sleep because of dyspnea. Intravenous furosemide was administered, along with continuous positive airway pressure (with a pressure of 10 cm of water and a rate of 4 liters of oxygen per minute). Cardiology and neurology consultations were requested.
Dr. Rincon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head and CTA of the head and neck showed chronic lacunar infarcts and chronic hypertensive microangiopathy (Figure 1B). No high-grade stenosis or large-vessel occlusion was noted. CT of the neck and mediastinum showed no mass or lymphadenopathy (Figure 1C).
Dr. Marinacci: On the second day, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of slurred speech, voice changes, and dyspnea. The examination was notable for tachypnea and a new onset of forgetfulness. The dysarthria was most pronounced with guttural sounds. She also had facial droop on the right side, subtle ptosis in the right eye, slight weakness in the proximal muscles on both sides, pronator drift on the left side, and the Babinski reflex in the right foot. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Rincon: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck showed findings similar to those seen on CT. No evidence of acute infarction was noted (Figure 1D). Scattered foci of susceptibility signal were present in the cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, and thalami, findings consistent with chronic microhemorrhages. MRA showed widely patent intracranial and cervical arteries (Figure 1E and 1F).
Dr. Marinacci: On the third day, the patient was somnolent and was using accessory muscles for breathing until bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated. An evaluation revealed weak cough and delayed swallow initiation. Owing to the degree of dysphagia, it was recommended that the patient avoid oral medications and food. The thyrotropin level was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Direct laryngoscopy showed an impaired swallow, normal vocal cords, and no mass or other source of obstruction. Intravenous furosemide and piperacillin–tazobactam and inhaled ipratropium were administered.
Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",Myasthenia gravis.
"Case 31-2024: A 37-Year-Old Man with Fever, Myalgia, Jaundice, and Respiratory Failure","Dr. Danielle C. Crabtree (Medicine): A 37-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, myalgia, jaundice, and hypoxemia.
The patient had been healthy until 9 days before this admission, when malaise, fatigue, and generalized weakness developed. The symptoms were severe, and he slept almost all day and night. Seven days before this admission, the patient had an oral temperature of 39.4°C, and headache developed, as well as achiness and stiffness in the arms, shoulders, knees, and legs. He was not able to eat a full meal because of decreased appetite and nausea. He did not have abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Five days before this admission, the fever and headache abated; however, the achiness increased, and the patient noticed that his urine was dark yellow. Three days before this admission, the patient sought evaluation in the urgent care clinic of another hospital. Testing was negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus types A and B. He was instructed to get adequate rest and hydration. Two days before this admission, the symptoms had not abated, and the patient returned to the urgent care clinic. On examination, new yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes was observed, and he was instructed to go to the emergency department of the other hospital.
On evaluation, the temporal temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 106/70 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The white-cell count was 17,900 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the platelet count 34,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000), and the hemoglobin level 15.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.0 to 17.0). The creatinine level was 3.0 mg per deciliter (265 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.4 mg per deciliter [53 to 124 μmol per liter]), the total bilirubin level 15.9 mg per deciliter (272 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.0 to 1.2 mg per deciliter [0 to 21 μmol per liter]), and the direct bilirubin level more than 10.0 mg per deciliter (171 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.0 to 0.5 mg per deciliter [0 to 9 μmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.

During the subsequent 2 days, the patient received intravenous fluids. On the third hospital day, the blood pressure decreased to 71/60 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation had also decreased. The creatinine level increased to 3.8 mg per deciliter (336 μmol per liter), the hemoglobin level decreased to 10.3 g per deciliter, and the total bilirubin level increased to 20.9 mg per deciliter (357 μmol per liter). Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula, and boluses of intravenous fluids were given. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment.
On evaluation, the patient reported exhaustion and shortness of breath but no cough, rhinorrhea, or congestion. He had no known medical conditions, took no medications, and had no known drug allergies. He lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with his partner, who had had an acute illness characterized by fever, malaise, nausea, and diarrhea that began 7 days before this admission and resolved after 4 days.
The patient worked in an office, and he took daily walks with his dog through the woods and along a river; he recalled receiving multiple insect bites during these walks. He reported no recent travel. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 16 years and used marijuana daily. He consumed two alcoholic drinks at a time, a few times per week, and he did not use illicit drugs.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 100/56 mm Hg, the pulse 103 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 42 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He was alert and oriented but appeared ill. He had increased work of breathing, with the use of accessory muscles of respiration; diffuse rales were heard in both lungs. There was no abdominal tenderness, hepatosplenomegaly, asterixis, or leg swelling. Marked scleral icterus and jaundiced skin were present, but he had no conjunctival suffusion, rash, or ulcers. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Ryan Chung: Radiography of the chest revealed bilateral, predominantly peripheral, patchy opacities (Figure 1A). Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed hyperechogenic and prominent portal triads with a “starry sky” appearance; there was no biliary ductal dilatation or hydronephrosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities with tree-in-bud nodularity in both lungs (Figure 1B and 1C), as well as small pleural effusions and enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes (Figure 1D). No hepatic lesions, biliary ductal dilatation, or hepatosplenomegaly were noted (Figure 1E).
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.
Dr. Crabtree: The patient started treatment with continuous positive airway pressure. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime and oral doxycycline was administered.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Icteric leptospirosis.
Case 30-2024: A 45-Year-Old Woman with Kidney Lesions and Lytic Bone Disease,"Dr. John H. Stone: A 45-year-old woman was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of retroperitoneal fibrosis and the possibility of IgG4-related disease.
Seven years before the current presentation, the patient had undergone a bone marrow biopsy at another hospital because of mild persistent polycythemia and leukocytosis. Examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed normocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. No evidence of a myeloproliferative neoplasm or a V617F mutation in the gene encoding Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) was detected.
Five years later (2 years before the current presentation), the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician because of polycythemia and flank pain on the left side. A faint IgG kappa monoclonal band was reportedly seen on immunoelectrophoresis. The blood levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, erythropoietin, and lactate dehydrogenase were reportedly normal.
Dr. Ambrose J. Huang: Ultrasonography performed at the first hospital reportedly revealed a complicated cyst, measuring 24 mm in diameter, in the upper pole of the left kidney with mural thickening and internal echoes. The patient also had an 18-mm parapelvic cyst in the middle portion of the left kidney, a 4-mm nonobstructive calculus in the left kidney, and mild parenchymal scarring in the right kidney. Seven weeks later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of gadolinium, allowed for further characterization of the lesions. The lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney reportedly had homogeneous enhancement and was suggestive of renal-cell carcinoma.
Approximately 17 months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated at the urology clinic of a second hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of contrast material, reportedly showed the enhancing 24-mm mass in the upper pole of the left kidney that was suggestive of renal-cell carcinoma. There was no evidence of metastatic disease. The 18-mm mass in the middle of the left kidney appeared as poorly circumscribed and hypoattenuating.
Dr. Stone: Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy was performed to remove the mass in the upper pole of the left kidney. Histopathological examination of the tissue specimen revealed mild focal global glomerulosclerosis, mild interstitial fibrosis, and mild arteriosclerosis. No tumor was seen.
Dr. Huang: Four months later, follow-up MRI of the abdomen and pelvis performed at the first hospital showed no recurrence of a mass in the surgical bed. Three months thereafter, ultrasonography performed at the first hospital reportedly revealed a new 19-mm hypoechoic lesion in the lower pole of the right kidney and showed a stable 18-mm mass in the middle of the left kidney. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI performed 1 month later showed that the 19-mm lesion in the lower pole of the right kidney was exophytic and enhancing (Figure 1A). The appearance of this lesion on imaging was reportedly similar to the appearance of the 24-mm lesion that had been resected from the left kidney.
FIGURE 1

Initial imaging Studies.
Dr. Stone: Approximately 7 months before the current presentation, the patient had a consultation with a urologist at a third hospital. A percutaneous CT-guided biopsy targeting the exophytic lesion in the lower pole of the right kidney was performed (Figure 1B). On histopathological examination, there was no renal parenchyma; it was assumed that only retroperitoneal tissue near the kidney had been obtained. The biopsy specimen showed atypical fibrous tissue with a storiform pattern of fibrosis and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. Polytypic kappa and lambda staining within plasma cells was noted. There were more than 10 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-power field, but these cells made up less than 40% of the overall IgG+ cells. Flow cytometry was performed on the tissue specimen obtained during the attempted renal biopsy and showed no monotypic B-cell population. The white-cell count, differential count, and blood levels of electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were test results for liver and kidney function; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A screening test for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was negative.

Dr. Huang: Two months later, whole-body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET)–CT performed at the first hospital reportedly showed that the skeleton had a diffusely heterogeneous appearance, with FDG uptake in both humeri, the left radius, and both acetabula (Figure 1C and 1D). Gadolinium-enhanced MRI performed 1 month later showed multiple enhancing marrow-replacing lesions in the left humerus (Figure 1E and 1F), the left ilium, and both acetabula (Figure 2A and 2B). These findings were suggestive of multiple myeloma, metastases, or an infiltrative process. The lesions in the right kidney had not changed since the previous MRI.
FIGURE 2

Additional Imaging Studies.
Dr. Stone: Three months later, the patient was evaluated at the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. On review of systems, she reported fatigue, as well as pain in the left shoulder and arm that had lasted for several months. She reported no weight change, fever, chills, or cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary symptoms. Her medical history was notable for early menopause, which had occurred at 40 years of age and had been attributed to primary ovarian failure, as well as celiac disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hiatal hernia, kidney stones, and migraines. Medications included atorvastatin, spironolactone, topiramate, and a multivitamin. She reported having adverse reactions to meperidine, methylprednisolone, and nickel.
The patient was self-employed and lived in a small town with her husband. She had one adult child. She had smoked one third of a pack of cigarettes per day for 10 years but had quit smoking more than 15 years before this evaluation. She had no history of alcohol or other substance use. Her mother had died in her 50s from renal-cell carcinoma. A maternal aunt had ovarian and uterine cancer, and another had ovarian cancer. The patient’s BRCA mutation status was negative.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the heart rate 63 beats per minute, the blood pressure 134/61 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 90 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 30.1. She had no proptosis, enlargement of the lacrimal glands, or enlargement of the major salivary glands (submandibular or parotid). No lymphadenopathy was present. The cardiac, lung, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. The musculoskeletal examination revealed tenderness and markedly limited abduction at the left shoulder but was otherwise unremarkable. The white-cell count, differential count, and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, and albumin were normal, as were test results for liver and kidney function; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Huang: A radiograph of the left shoulder showed a lytic lesion in the greater tuberosity that corresponded to lesions that had been identified on PET-CT and MRI (Figure 2C). Three months later, repeat whole-body PET-CT performed at the first hospital reportedly showed FDG uptake in both humeri and both acetabula. No hypermetabolic lymph nodes or lytic bone lesions were reportedly present on CT.
Dr. Stone: A CT-guided bone biopsy of the left humerus performed at the first hospital reportedly showed fragments of trabecular bone. The bone marrow contained a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with many plasma cells and fibrosis. Immunostaining showed a high background level of kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains, without a clonal population, as well as scattered IgG4+ cells.
Five months after the initial presentation, the patient returned to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody was negative, as was an interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Two doses of rituximab were prescribed, but the patient had an infusion reaction while the second dose was being administered and was unable to complete the course.
Dr. Huang: Four months later, whole-body MRI performed at the first hospital reportedly showed multiple 2-to-3-cm lesions in the humeri and acetabula that had not changed substantially from previous imaging studies. Additional 3-cm lesions were noted in the distal femurs, proximal tibias, and proximal fibulas (Figure 2D and 2E); these findings had not been seen previously.
Dr. Stone: Histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen and aspirate of a left tibial lesion was performed at the first hospital. Polytypic light-chain expression was noted, with more than 30 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-power field and an IgG4:IgG ratio of greater than 40%.
Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",Rosai–Dorfman–Destombes disease.
Case 29-2024: A 47-Year-Old Man with Confusion and Kidney Failure,"Dr. Suellen S. Li (Medicine): A 47-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of confusion and acute kidney failure.
The patient had been well until 6 days before the current admission, when fatigue and myalgias developed. During the subsequent 2 days, he continued to report to his job at a restaurant. Four days before this admission, the patient’s coworkers noticed that he was mildly confused. On the day of this admission, the confusion markedly increased, and new word-finding difficulties and garbled speech developed. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.
On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient was not able to participate fully in the interview or a review of systems because of confusion, but he described feeling hot and short of breath. He had not mentioned any recent cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or headache to his family or coworkers. He had no known recent falls, trauma, travel, or sick contacts.
Additional history was obtained from the patient’s family. He had no known medical problems or drug allergies. He used no prescription medications but took ginseng extract and burdock root supplements. He lived in an urban area of New England with a friend and no pets in a former factory that had been converted into apartments. The patient smoked marijuana occasionally and had smoked cigarettes as a teenager. He drank alcohol infrequently and did not use illicit drugs. His sister had Sjögren’s syndrome, nemaline myopathy, cardiomyopathy, Fanconi’s anemia, and renal tubular acidosis. His parents were healthy.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 35.8°C, the blood pressure 142/78 mm Hg, the pulse 114 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient appeared anxious. He was alert and oriented; however, when he was asked a question, he often needed clarification and was slow to answer. He could not recite the days of the week backward and had difficulty following complex commands. His face was symmetric, and no dysarthria was noted. Cranial-nerve function, muscle tone and strength, sensation, proprioception, deep-tendon reflexes, and gait were normal. He did not have photophobia. The mucous membranes were moist, and the neck was supple. There was no jugular venous distention. The heart sounds were normal, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was nontender, and there was no hepatosplenomegaly. He had no leg swelling or rash.
The patient had a white-cell count of 13,270 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000). The blood urea nitrogen level was 117 mg per deciliter (41.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), the creatinine level 13.0 mg per deciliter (1149 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]), and the creatine kinase level 28,581 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). He had hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis, as well as elevated blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A comprehensive urine toxicology screen was negative, as was a serum toxicology screen for acetaminophen, salicylates, ethanol, and tricyclic antidepressants. Nucleic acid testing of a specimen obtained from the nasopharynx was negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Dr. Melissa C. Price: Imaging studies were obtained. Radiography of the chest revealed an opacity in the right lower lobe (Figure 1A). Computed tomography (CT) of the head was normal.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies of the Chest.
Dr. Li: Intravenous dextrose, insulin, calcium gluconate, and fluids were administered, and treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin was started. A Foley catheter was placed, and oliguria was noted. The patient was admitted to this hospital.
Three hours after the patient’s arrival, the temporal temperature increased to 38.2°C. The respiratory rate increased to 45 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 98%.
Dr. Price: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed consolidation in the right lower lobe with minimal adjacent ground-glass opacity (Figure 1B). There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy.
Dr. Li: A diagnostic test was performed.",Legionella infection complicated by rhabdomyolysis.
"Case 28-2024: A 75-Year-Old Woman with Edema, Arthritis, and Proteinuria","Dr. Christine M. Parsons (Medicine): A 75-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of arthritis, abdominal pain, edema, malaise, and fever.
Three weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed waxing and waning “throbbing” pain in the right upper abdomen, which she rated at 9 (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain) at its maximal intensity. The pain was associated with nausea and fever with a temperature of up to 39.0°C. Pain worsened after food consumption and was relieved with acetaminophen. During the 3 weeks before the current admission, edema developed in both legs; it had started at the ankles and gradually progressed upward to the hips. When the edema began to affect her ambulation, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital.
A review of systems that was obtained from the patient and her family was notable for intermittent fever, abdominal bloating, anorexia, and fatigue that had progressed during the previous 3 weeks. The patient reported new orthopnea and nonproductive cough. Approximately 4 weeks earlier, she had had diarrhea for several days. During the 6 weeks before the current admission, the patient had lost 9 kg unintentionally; she also had had pain in the wrists and hands, 3 days of burning and dryness of the eyes, and diffuse myalgias. She had not had night sweats, dry mouth, jaw claudication, vision changes, urinary symptoms, or oral, nasal, or genital ulcers.
The patient’s medical history was notable for multiple myeloma (for which treatment with thalidomide and melphalan had been initiated 2 years earlier and was stopped approximately 1 year before the current admission); hypothyroidism; chikungunya virus infection (diagnosed 7 years earlier); seropositive erosive rheumatoid arthritis affecting the hands, wrists, elbows, and shoulders (diagnosed 3 years earlier); vitiligo; and osteoarthritis of the right hip, for which she had undergone arthroplasty. Evidence of gastritis was reportedly seen on endoscopy that had been performed 6 months earlier. Medications included daily treatment with levothyroxine and acetaminophen and pipazethate hydrochloride as needed for cough. The patient consumed chamomile and horsetail herbal teas. She had no known allergies to medications, but she had been advised not to take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs after her diagnosis of multiple myeloma.
Approximately 5 months before the current admission, the patient had emigrated from Central America. She lived with her daughter and grandchildren in an urban area of New England. She had previously worked in health care. She had no history of alcohol, tobacco, or other substance use. There was no family history of cancer or autoimmune, renal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, or cardiac disease.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 37.1°C, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 152/67 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She had a frail appearance and bitemporal cachexia. The weight was 41 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 15.2. Her dentition was poor; most of the teeth were missing, caries were present in the remaining teeth, and the mucous membranes were dry. She had abdominal tenderness on the right side and mild abdominal distention, without organomegaly or guarding. Bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy was palpable. Infrequent inspiratory wheezing was noted.
The patient had swan-neck deformity, boutonnière deformity, ulnar deviation, and distal hyperextensibility of the thumbs (Fig. 1). Subcutaneous nodules were observed on the proximal interphalangeal joints of the second and third fingers of the right hand and on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger of the left hand. Synovial thickening of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the second fingers was noted. There was mild swelling and tenderness of the wrists. She had pain with flexion of the shoulders and right hip, and there was subtle swelling of the shoulders and right knee. Pitting edema (3+) and vitiligo were noted on the legs. No sclerodactyly, digital pitting, telangiectasias, appreciable calcinosis, nodules, nail changes (including pitting), or tophi were present. The remainder of the examination was normal.
FIGURE 1

Photograph of the Hands.
The blood levels of glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, globulin, lactate, lipase, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal, as were the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 3+ protein and 3+ blood, and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field and granular casts. Urine and blood were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram met (at a borderline level) the voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy.

Dr. Rene Balza Romero: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed scattered subcentimeter pulmonary nodules (including clusters in the right middle lobe and patchy and ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe), trace pleural effusion in the left lung, coronary and valvular calcifications, and trace pericardial effusion, ascites, and anasarca. The scans also showed slight enlargement of the axillary lymph nodes (up to 11 mm in the short axis) bilaterally and a chronic-appearing compression fracture involving the T12 vertebral body.
Dr. Parsons: Morphine and lactated Ringer’s solution were administered intravenously. On the second day in the emergency department (also referred to as hospital day 2), the blood levels of haptoglobin, folate, and vitamin B12 were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A rapid antigen test for malaria was positive. Wright–Giemsa staining of thick and thin peripheral-blood smears was negative for parasites; the smears also showed Döhle bodies and basophilic stippling. Antigliadin antibodies and anti–tissue transglutaminase antibodies were not detected. Tests for hepatitis A IgG and hepatitis C antibodies were positive. Tests for hepatitis B core and surface antibodies were negative. A test for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) was negative.
Findings on abdominal ultrasound imaging performed on the second day (Fig. 2A and 2B) were notable for a small volume of ascites and kidneys with echogenic parenchyma. Ultrasonography of the legs showed no deep venous thrombosis. An echocardiogram showed normal ventricular size and function, aortic sclerosis with mild aortic insufficiency, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, a right ventricular systolic pressure of 39 mm Hg, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion. Intravenous hydromorphone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.
FIGURE 2

Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Hands.
On the third day (also referred to as hospital day 3), nucleic acid testing for cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and hepatitis C virus was negative, and a stool antigen test for Helicobacter pylori was negative. An interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also negative. Oral acetaminophen and ivermectin and intravenous hydromorphone and furosemide were administered.
Dr. Balza Romero: Radiographs of the hands (Fig. 2C through 2F) showed joint-space narrowing of both radiocarpal joints and proximal interphalangeal erosions involving both hands. Radiographs of the shoulders showed arthritis of the glenohumeral joint and alignment suggestive of a tear of the right rotator cuff. A radiograph of the pelvis showed diffuse joint-space narrowing of the left hip, without osteophytosis, and an intact right hip prosthesis.
Dr. Parsons: Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.","Overlap syndrome of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus complicated by proliferative lupus nephritis, superimposed on amyloid A amyloidosis."
Case 27-2024: A 24-Year-Old Man with Pain and Dyspnea,"Dr. Meridale V. Baggett: One hundred years ago, a 24-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.1
The patient had been well until 3 days before this admission, when malaise, generalized weakness, headache, and back pain developed. During the next 2 days, his symptoms persisted, and he remained at home and slept in bed for most of the day. On the day before this admission, he began to have fever, dry cough, and chills that caused him to shake considerably and “hunched him up in a knot.” He was unable to get out of bed. He took aspirin at a dose of 10 grains (648 mg) every 4 hours, which led to decreased severity of the headache and back pain. On the day of this admission, the patient awoke with difficulty breathing and chest pain just below the xiphoid process. The pain increased with deep breathing and coughing. He sought evaluation at this hospital.
On examination, the rectal temperature ranged from 39.5°C to 40.8°C, the heart rate from 92 to 145 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate from 28 to 58 breaths per minute. The patient appeared acutely ill and nervous. He was shivering despite being wrapped up in several blankets. His breathing was rapid, shallow, and labored. He had frequent paroxysms of racking cough, which caused excruciating pain under the lower sternum. The cough was productive of pinkish, thick, slightly purulent sputum.
On palpation, the apical impulse of the heart was felt in the fifth intercostal space, 8 cm to the left of the sternum along the midclavicular line. There was no enlargement of the heart on percussion. On auscultation, the heart sounds were rapid and regular, and there was a soft systolic murmur at the apex that did not radiate. The breath sounds were diminished at the right side of the back, from the lower third of the scapula downward, but had no definitive dullness or change in character. No evidence of rales or a friction rub was noted.
The throat was somewhat injected, and the tonsils had been surgically removed. A healed surgical scar was present on the left side of the abdomen, at the site of a previous hernia repair. The abdomen was not distended or tender. The skin was dry and hot to the touch. The white-cell count ranged from 3700 to 14,500 per microliter, with neutrophil predominance (79%). Blood cultures showed no growth.
Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: A posteroanterior chest radiograph (Figure 1) showed bilateral patchy consolidations, previously described as “mottled dullness,” that were most confluent in the right upper lobe and the left lower lobe. This finding is suggestive of pneumonia. There was also fullness in the left hilar region, which is suggestive of lymphadenopathy. The presence of a left pleural effusion cannot be ruled out.
FIGURE 1

Chest Radiograph.
Dr. Kathy M. Tran: Adhesive plaster was applied to the patient’s chest, and he was admitted to this hospital. On the second hospital day, the shortness of breath and chest pain on inspiration continued. The cough became productive of purulent sputum and blood. W.H. Smith performed a physical examination. The patient appeared very ill and held his abdominal muscles rigid while coughing. A systolic apical bruit was detected, along with dullness at the right lung base. Small hyperemic papules were seen on the left palm and the right index finger. Smith noted a “serious outlook” for the patient.
On the third hospital day, the sputum became much more purulent. On examination, increased dullness was noted on percussion of the left lower back. Increased tactile fremitus was also noted. Loud bronchial breath sounds and very few rales were heard at the left side of the back, from the lower third of the scapula downward. Slight dullness was present on percussion of the right lower back, and there were distant breath sounds and occasional medium rales.
On the fourth hospital day, the patient continued to be very ill. He gradually grew weaker, and that evening, he died.
A diagnosis was made.","Bronchopneumonia, most likely due to influenza."
"Case 26-2024: A 59-Year-Old Woman with Aphasia, Anemia, and a Breast Mass","Dr. Sahar Shahamatdar (Medicine): A 59-year-old woman was referred to the multidisciplinary breast oncology clinic of this hospital for evaluation of a long-standing breast lesion.
The patient had had limited medical care since she was 34 years of age. Three weeks before the current evaluation, she presented to another hospital with fever, confusion, and word-finding difficulties. At the time of that presentation, the patient was inattentive and disoriented, and mild expressive aphasia without motor deficits was present. She had a large, bleeding exophytic mass in the right breast.
Dr. Janice N. Thai: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed a wedge-shaped area of low density in the left temporoparietal region. This finding is consistent with acute infarction.
Dr. Shahamatdar: A screening test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was positive. Laboratory studies, including a complete blood count, were notable for a hemoglobin level of 4.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 11.0 to 15.0), a mean corpuscular volume of 69.7 fl (reference range, 80.0 to 100.0), and a platelet count of 922,000 per microliter (reference range, 130,000 to 400,000).
Dr. Thai: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a large cystic and solid mass in the right breast, measuring 14.9 cm by 16.2 cm by 20.0 cm (Figure 1A and 1B). Associated prominence of the intramammary, internal mammary, subpectoral, and axillary lymph nodes was observed. Heterogeneous lesions of the ribs and pulmonary nodules that could indicate metastatic disease were also noted (Figure 1C). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, provided additional evidence of ischemic stroke and showed no evidence of intracranial metastases (Figure 1D and 1E).
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Shahamatdar: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Packed red cells were transfused, and a compressive bandage was applied to the breast lesion. By hospital day 2, the patient’s confusion and inattention had resolved, but mild expressive aphasia persisted. Consent was obtained from the patient, and she underwent incisional biopsy of the breast lesion while under local anesthesia. The patient’s hospitalization was complicated by cellulitis in the right arm at the site where a peripheral intravenous catheter had been placed, for which she was treated with intravenous antibiotic agents. She was discharged on hospital day 11 with pathological results pending, and follow-up was planned with the breast oncology clinic of this hospital.
Four days after discharge, the patient had a sudden onset of profuse bleeding from the breast lesion, which led to hypotension, and she was again admitted to the other hospital. She received a total of 5 units of packed red cells, and bleeding was managed conservatively with sterile gauze and compressive bandaging. No further episodes of bleeding occurred. On hospital day 4, she was discharged home with plans to attend a multidisciplinary oncology evaluation at this hospital 2 days later.
In the breast oncology clinic, the patient reported worsening discomfort, bleeding, and drainage from the breast mass and the associated wound. She noted that progressive fatigue had developed in recent weeks but reported no fever or chills. She had first noted a palpable lesion in the right breast when she was 32 years of age, approximately 27 years before the current presentation. The patient had pursued an evaluation with breast imaging at that time, and she recollected that the lesion had been characterized as a benign finding. A biopsy had not been performed. During the intervening years, she had not pursued routine medical care, including breast imaging. She attributed the lack of medical follow-up to ongoing demands related to caring for her young child and stressors in her personal and work life. She reported that slow but steady growth of the breast lesion had occurred during those years. Approximately 2 years before the current presentation, the patient had noted more rapid growth of the lesion with progressive skin breakdown, discomfort, and drainage that she thought was related to chronic infection.
Menarche had occurred when the patient was 10 years of age and menopause at 50 years of age. The patient had had one pregnancy, and she had used hormonal contraception for a total of 15 years during her lifetime. She had not received any hormone-replacement therapy. At the time of the current presentation, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score was 1 (assessed on a scale of 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater disability). Medications included amlodipine, atorvastatin, ferrous sulfate, and polyethylene glycol. Her family history included breast cancer in her maternal aunt. She lived in New England with her adult son and was a small-business owner. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke cigarettes.
On physical examination, the oral temperature was 36.5°C, the blood pressure 136/81 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A large, fungating breast mass was present, which had foci of necrosis and areas of dried blood without palpable ipsilateral lymphadenopathy. Auscultation of the heart was notable for tachycardia without murmur. A neurologic examination did not reveal motor deficits, and the previously reported expressive aphasia had resolved. The patient was attentive and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The affect and mood were appropriate, and she did not report hallucinations, suicidal ideation, or symptoms of depression. She had normal insight and capacity with regard to the nature of her diagnosis and recent clinical course.
Management decisions were made.","Metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma, originating in the breast."
Case 25-2024: A 12-Year-Old Boy with Autism and Decreased Vision,"Dr. Amy E. Armstrong-Javors: A 12-year-old boy with autism was admitted to this hospital because of decreased vision in both eyes.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 weeks before this admission, when he began to have difficulty seeing in both eyes. His vision was decreased when he woke up in the morning, improved throughout the day, and worsened again at night. Three weeks before the current admission, the patient told his parents about the vision changes. They took him to an optometry clinic for evaluation. Eyeglasses were not prescribed; a routine annual follow-up evaluation was scheduled.
During the next 3 weeks, the patient noticed that the decrease in vision worsened. He typically walked on his toes and held onto his parents as he walked; however, 4 days before this admission, his parents noticed that he leaned on them heavily while walking. Two days before the current admission, they observed him walking into doors and walls and bumping into objects. On the day of this admission, the patient woke up screaming and panicked because he could not see. His parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital.
On evaluation, the patient reported that his vision had improved slightly throughout the day. He described darkening of his vision that was worse in the left eye than in the right eye. He was having difficulty identifying movement and details of objects, although he was able to see shapes and colors. The parents reported that the patient had been having puffiness and crusting of the eyes for 2 days, with no eye redness or pain. Review of systems was notable for 3 days of diarrhea and nausea. He had no fever, headache, rashes, mouth sores, joint pain, or weakness.
The patient was born prematurely, at 7 months’ gestation. Labor and delivery had taken place outside the hospital setting, and perinatal hypoxia had occurred. The patient had been taken urgently to another hospital, where he was resuscitated and then hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit for 2 months. The patient had autism and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He had developmental delays in speech, language, cognition, and fine motor skills. He had received all routine childhood vaccinations and was taking risperidone; there were no known drug allergies.
The patient lived with his parents and older sister, all of whom were healthy. Ten months before this admission, they had moved from an urban area to a rural area in New England. The patient was in sixth grade and was enrolled in special education classes at school. He had been an avid player of video and virtual reality games, but his parents had removed the gaming systems from their home 2 months before the patient’s vision changes had begun. He continued to watch videos on the computer and television; his parents noted that he did not sit close to the devices and sometimes looked at the wall instead of the screen. The patient’s parents described him as a “picky eater.” His diet consisted almost exclusively of hamburgers, french fries, ranch dressing, glazed doughnuts, and juice boxes. The patient avoided trying new foods and did not take vitamin pills or gummies because he disliked the taste or texture.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 104/71 mm Hg, the heart rate 94 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 156 cm (70th percentile), the weight 40.3 kg (38th percentile), and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 16.6. The patient was pale, alert, interactive, and wary of the physical examination.
Dr. Ryan A. Gise: Mild periorbital swelling was present. The visual acuity in both eyes was limited to hand motion. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, and the extraocular movements were full. Color-vision testing, automated perimetry, fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography could not be performed because the patient had poor vision and was unable to cooperate. A slit-lamp examination was notable only for keratinization of the conjunctiva in both eyes. A funduscopic examination revealed pallor of the optic disk in both eyes. Examination of the peripheral retina was limited because the patient was unable to cooperate.
Dr. Armstrong-Javors: Strength, sensation, reflexes, and coordination were normal. A gait examination revealed toe walking; the patient asked for assistance when walking. The abdomen was nontender. Horizontal ridges were present on the toenails (Figure 1), and there were scattered bruises on the arms and legs. No ulcers or rashes were seen. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital.

Dr. Camilo Jaimes: During the next 2 days, imaging was attempted but limited because the patient was anxious about the testing. On the third hospital day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits, with and without the intravenous administration of contrast material, was successfully performed while the patient was under sedation (Figure 2). A fluid-sensitive short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence showed subtle hyperintensity of the mid-intraorbital segments of the optic nerves in both eyes, with no enhancement. The optic chiasm, optic tracts, and optic-nerve sheath complexes appeared normal. Diffuse heterogeneous thickening of the calvarium was present.

Case 24-2024: A 30-Year-Old Woman with Postpartum Anxiety and Intrusive Thoughts,"Dr. Rebecca Leval (Psychiatry): A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the psychiatry clinic of this hospital 4 weeks after the birth of her first child because of anxiety and intrusive thoughts.
The patient (gravida 1, para 1) had had gestational hypertension, for which she had not received medication; otherwise, her pregnancy had been uncomplicated. Four weeks before the current evaluation, she went into labor at 39 weeks 1 day’s gestation and gave birth to a healthy male infant by spontaneous vaginal delivery in the labor and delivery unit of this hospital. Skin-to-skin contact, in which the infant is placed on the bare chest of the mother, was started immediately after the baby was born. During the next 2 days, the patient was engaged and inquisitive during postpartum counseling and education. She was able to initiate breast-feeding and appeared to be bonding appropriately with the infant. On the fourth hospital day, she was discharged home.
At home, the patient breast-fed the infant but noticed that he had a poor latch. One day after discharge, the patient called the obstetrics clinic of this hospital to request lactation advice. She also described having difficulty sleeping and feeling anxious and nervous since giving birth. The patient was advised to start pumping breast milk in addition to breast-feeding. Treatment with sertraline was initiated.
Three weeks before the current evaluation, the patient called the obstetrics clinic again for advice regarding the use of the breast pump. She was also concerned that the difficulties with breast-feeding were interfering with bonding with the infant, and she noted that her blood pressure, which she had measured with an ambulatory monitor at home, was 164/101 mm Hg. The patient was advised to seek evaluation in the labor and delivery unit of this hospital.
On evaluation, the patient described insomnia, anxiety, painful nipples, decreased appetite, and mild headache. She reported no blurred vision or abdominal pain. The blood pressure was 140/84 mm Hg and the pulse 107 beats per minute. The patient appeared worried and anxious. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of kidney and liver function. The urinalysis was normal. Treatment with nifedipine was initiated for hypertension, along with lorazepam as needed for anxiety. Sertraline therapy was continued. The patient was discharged home.
The next day, the patient awoke and told her husband, “I can’t go on like this. I can’t do this anymore. I can’t wake up feeling like this again.” He called the obstetrics clinic and was instructed to bring her to the labor and delivery unit. On evaluation, the patient stated that she had stopped breast-feeding because of bleeding of the nipples and had started feeding with formula. She felt exhausted and “emotionally numb,” and she sometimes could not remember whether she had fed the baby. She described feeling lonely, isolated, distressed, and unable to engage in most child care duties. The patient’s mother had been visiting her and her husband to assist them with child care.
The patient reported that, during the pregnancy, she had been excited and had felt “ready and prepared,” although somewhat nervous in anticipation of the delivery. She had not felt traumatized after the pregnancy or delivery, but when she had returned home, she felt “hit by a ton of trains.” She would awaken frequently during the night when the infant made noises. When the infant was quiet, the patient was unable to sleep because of racing thoughts and feeling overwhelmed. She said, “The idea of being this baby’s mother for the rest of my life is too much for me to handle. I don’t want to do this now or for the rest of my life.” She added, “I wish I were dead sometimes” but reported no active suicidal or homicidal ideation or plan.
The patient had a history of intermittent insomnia and migraines. She had had dysthymic symptoms as a teenager when she had moved to the United States from Central America, and she had had mild generalized anxiety and anxiety with public speaking during college, for which she had taken propranolol. She had had no previous suicidal or homicidal ideation or history of self-harm behaviors, and she had never had a psychiatric admission or intensive psychiatric treatment. The patient took prenatal vitamins, nifedipine, and sertraline. She also took lorazepam as needed for anxiety, acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for headaches, and docusate for constipation. There were no known drug allergies. She was on maternity leave from her work as an administrator, and she lived in suburban New England with her infant and husband. She felt safe and supported in the home. The patient drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Her mother had migraines, her father hypertension and anxiety, her brother anxiety, her maternal grandmother hematologic cancer, and her paternal grandmother hypertension. Her maternal grandfather had died of lung cancer and her paternal grandfather of a stroke.
On the day of the current evaluation, the patient presented to this hospital to establish care with a psychiatrist. On evaluation, the patient repeatedly said, “The baby is a good baby” and stated that she did not want to hurt the infant or other people; however, she described intrusive thoughts of stabbing the infant and had visual hallucinations of herself holding a knife. She noted that the thoughts had started after delivery and had become increasingly vivid and frequent. They caused distress and anxiety and led to episodes of intense crying, rapid breathing, and feeling shaky. She avoided the kitchen because knives were present, and she had stopped cooking — an activity that she had previously enjoyed. The patient did not feel comfortable holding or feeding the infant because of the unwanted, intrusive thoughts and thus avoided physical contact with him. However, she checked on him every few minutes to make sure that he was alive and breathing and frequently asked her husband whether the infant was OK. The patient repeatedly searched on the internet looking for reassurance that she would not act on these thoughts. She contacted other mothers online and talked to her husband and mother to seek reassurance that she was not “a bad mother.” However, she had not told them or her clinicians about the intrusive thoughts because she was terrified that the infant would be taken away from her.
On examination, the blood pressure was 138/83 mm Hg and the pulse 68 beats per minute. The patient was tearful and appeared exhausted. Her mood was anxious and dysphoric, and her affect was restricted and congruent with her mood. She did not have disorganized thinking, delusional content, or perceptual disturbances.
A diagnosis was made.",Postpartum obsessive–compulsive disorder.
Case 23-2024: A 78-Year-Old Woman with Rapidly Progressive Dementia,"Dr. Prashanth Rajarajan (Neurology): A 78-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of progressive confusion and evolving changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 months before the current admission, when she began to have a flat affect, which the patient’s daughter had attributed to grief after the death of the patient’s sister. The patient had a 3-year history of mild problems with memory, but more severe memory issues had developed along with the change in affect. Four months before the current admission, she was admitted to another hospital after an acute episode of word-finding difficulty that had been witnessed by her daughter.
Dr. Saurabh Rohatgi: At that time, MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1A and 1B), revealed a subcentimeter focus of high signal intensity in the right frontal lobe on diffusion-weighted sequences and “pseudonormalization” on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient, with corresponding T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showing hyperintensity consistent with subacute infarction. T2-weighted FLAIR images also showed multiple foci of hyperintensity (measuring up to 1.1 cm in diameter) in both cerebellar hemispheres that were consistent with chronic infarcts. In addition, multiple areas of hyperintensity were seen on T2-weighted FLAIR images in the periventricular, deep, and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres; these findings were suggestive of small-vessel disease. Gradient-echo sequences showed several punctate foci of susceptibility in a lobar distribution, findings that were consistent with chronic microhemorrhages. Magnetic resonance angiography (Figure 1C) showed normal intracranial arteries.
FIGURE 1

MRI and Magnetic Resonance Angiography of the Head.
Dr. Rajarajan: Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function, dilatation of the atria and right ventricle, moderate mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and no evidence of intracardiac shunting. Treatment with aspirin was started, and the patient was discharged home on hospital day 3 with a plan for extended outpatient cardiac monitoring.
Ten days after discharge, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. The patient’s daughter, who had been living with her since discharge from the hospital because she did not think that the patient was safe living alone, accompanied her to the appointment. The patient’s daughter reported that the patient had been impulsive and occasionally confused, as well as progressively more forgetful. Attention and focus were impaired, and the patient had to be redirected during the interview. The remainder of the examination was normal. Treatment with mirtazapine was started for possible depression. Electroencephalography (EEG) was scheduled to rule out seizure with a postictal state as a cause of confusion. However, owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the EEG was canceled.
During the next 14 weeks, the patient needed progressively more assistance with activities of daily living, including multiple reminders to eat meals and help with bathing. Her episodes of confusion occurred mostly at night. When these episodes began to increase in frequency, the patient’s daughter brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
The patient had difficulty recalling past and recent events, and additional history was obtained from the patient’s daughter. The patient had had an 11-kg weight loss during the preceding 3 months that the daughter had attributed to an improved diet while they were living together. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, emphysema, sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, and obesity. Stage II infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast had been diagnosed 17 years before the current admission and had been treated with lumpectomy and chemoradiation therapy, followed by 3 years of treatment with tamoxifen and exemestane. The patient continued to undergo surveillance with alternating mammography and MRI of the breasts every 6 months; the last breast MRI, which had been performed 5 months before the current admission, showed normal results. Stage 1 adenocarcinoma of the lung had been diagnosed 14 years before the current admission and had been treated with surgical resection. The patient continued to undergo surveillance with annual computed tomography (CT) of the chest; the last CT of the chest, which had been performed 13 months before the current admission, showed a stable nodule in the right upper lobe that measured 7 mm in diameter.
Medications included esomeprazole, dulaglutide, hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, losartan, metformin, rosuvastatin, inhaled fluticasone, inhaled formoterol, and as-needed treatment with ipratropium–albuterol delivered by nebulizer. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was retired and had previously worked as a nurse. She was divorced and had lived independently in New England until she was hospitalized 4 months before the current admission. She drank alcohol occasionally and had a 75-pack-year smoking history and quit after lung cancer was diagnosed. Her mother had had coronary artery disease, and her father had had emphysema.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 37.0°C, the blood pressure 162/71 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 167.6 cm, the weight 91.3 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.4. The patient was alert and interactive; she was oriented to name only. She was inattentive and tangential in conversation, with perseveration. Her speech was fluent without paraphasic errors. Cranial-nerve function was normal. Test results for strength, sensation, deep-tendon reflexes, and cerebellar function were normal.
The blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, thyrotropin, cobalamin, lactate dehydrogenase, cortisol, and C-reactive protein were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function and coagulation. The complete blood count and differential count were normal except for the level of hemoglobin, which was 10.2 g per liter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 35 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). Screening tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative, as was an interferon-γ release assay to detect previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Rohatgi: Chest radiography showed bibasilar patchy opacities. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new symmetric, confluent signal hyperintensity in the bilateral hippocampi, amygdala, and medial and anterior temporal lobes on T2-weighted and FLAIR images (Figure 1D and 1E). There was no evidence of acute or subacute infarction or associated abnormal enhancement. Multiple punctate foci of susceptibility were seen in a predominantly lobar distribution in both cerebral hemispheres on susceptibility-weighted imaging (Figure 1F) — a finding that was suggestive of microhemorrhages. New hemosiderin staining was present within the sulci of the right parietal lobe.
Dr. Rajarajan: A lumbar puncture was performed for evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which was clear and colorless. In the third tube of CSF, there were 3 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5) and 8 red cells per microliter (reference value, 0). The CSF level of protein was 47 mg per deciliter (reference range, 8 to 32) and the glucose level 112 mg per deciliter (6.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 40 to 70 mg per deciliter [2.2 to 3.9 mmol per liter]). The concurrent blood level of glucose was 191 mg per deciliter (10.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 74 to 100 mg per deciliter [4.1 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). There were 16 oligoclonal bands (reference range, 0 to 1); an IgG index was not obtained. No organisms were seen on Gram’s staining, and nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA was negative. The patient was admitted to this hospital.
An EEG showed diffuse delta and theta slowing and disorganization of the background. There were abundant bilateral independent, temporal epileptiform discharges as well as brief runs of independent, lateralized periodic discharges in both temporal lobes.
Diagnostic tests were performed.",Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis due to small-cell lung carcinoma and concurrent cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
"Case 22-2024: A 30-Year-Old Woman with Postpartum Fever, Abdominal Pain, and Skin Ulcers","Dr. Molly Siegel (Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology): A 30-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 1) was admitted to this hospital 6 days after the delivery of her baby because of fever and abdominal pain.
The patient had received routine prenatal care at another hospital. Laboratory test results obtained 6 months before this admission are shown in Table 1.

Six days before this admission, the patient went into labor at 35 weeks 3 days’ gestation and was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The result of testing for group B streptococcus colonization was not available; empirical treatment with vancomycin was administered. Spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred, resulting in clear, odorless fluid. Eight hours later, the patient vaginally delivered a male infant and an intact placenta. She had lost an estimated 300 ml of blood, and she had a second-degree perineal laceration, which was repaired. The baby was large for gestational age, weighing 3575 g. On the second postpartum day, the patient was discharged home.
During the subsequent 4 days, the patient pumped breast milk and visited her baby in the special care nursery of this hospital daily while he was being treated for prematurity and feeding difficulties. She had mild diffuse abdominal and pelvic cramping and vaginal bleeding with occasional clots. On the day of the current admission, fever and chills developed, and the patient returned to the emergency department of this hospital. Review of systems was notable for small, painful bumps in the inguinal area on both sides that had developed during pregnancy and had intermittently drained blood and pus. She also had leg swelling that had abated since childbirth.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 38.7°C and the blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg. The lungs were clear on auscultation, the breasts nontender, the uterine fundus mildly tender, and the legs mildly swollen. Tender, erythematous pustules that drained yellow, purulent fluid were present in the inguinal area on the right side; scarring was present in the inguinal area on the left side. The repaired perineal laceration was healing well. The white-cell count was 22,940 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and cervical cultures were obtained.
The patient had rosacea, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa. Episodes of diverticulitis had occurred 5 years and 2 years before this admission, and an episode of epiploic appendagitis had occurred 10 weeks before this admission. She was taking prenatal vitamins, topical azelaic acid, and acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for abdominal pain. Amoxicillin and cephalexin had caused hives. She worked as an educator and lived with her husband and dog in a suburban area of New England. She did not vape or smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her father and paternal grandfather had arthritis that had been diagnosed in early adulthood, her brother had Crohn’s disease, and another brother had neurofibromatosis. Her mother was healthy.
Dr. Rory L. Cochran: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed normal postpartum uterine enlargement, with mild adjacent fat stranding.
Dr. Siegel: Empirical treatment with gentamicin and clindamycin was started. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of endometritis. Fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis did not abate, and vancomycin was added on hospital day 3. A test dose of cefepime was administered on hospital day 4. When the patient did not have an allergic reaction to the test dose, gentamicin and clindamycin were stopped, and she was treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole.
Dr. Melanie C. Kwan: On hospital day 6, an endometrial biopsy was performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed neutrophilic debris that included fragments of stroma with a dense neutrophilic infiltrate.
Dr. Cochran: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography of the pelvis, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed mild ascites (Figure 1A) and anasarca (Figure 1B). No evidence of retained products of conception, fluid collections, or venous or arterial thromboses was observed. Four days later, magnetic resonance angiography of the pelvis revealed increased ascites and anasarca, as well as two new fluid collections: a peripherally enhancing left parametrial collection that measured 6.3 cm in largest dimension (Figure 1C) and a collection located near the right uterocervical junction that measured 3.2 cm in largest dimension (Figure 1D).
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Pelvis.
Dr. Siegel: Treatment with cefepime and metronidazole was stopped, vancomycin was continued, and meropenem was started because of ongoing fever. A percutaneous catheter was inserted into the left parametrial fluid collection, and 20 ml of purulent fluid was drained; cultures showed no growth.
On hospital day 11, abdominal pain increased, and shortness of breath developed. The oxygen saturation was 86% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 91%. The temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 109/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The patient appeared tired and ill. Marked jugular venous distention was present. The heart sounds were tachycardic and regular, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was distended and diffusely tender on palpation, and the percutaneous catheter inserted along the midline of the pelvis had scant purulent drainage. Diffuse anasarca and symmetric 1+ ankle edema were present. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal biventricular function; however, the right atrium and right ventricle were dilated, and the interventricular septum was flattened during diastole. The main pulmonary artery and its branches were also dilated.
Dr. Cochran: CT pulmonary angiography showed bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis and no pulmonary embolism. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed increased ascites and anasarca, new splenomegaly, new hepatomegaly with heterogeneous peripheral enhancement (Figure 1E), and mild periportal edema. The percutaneously drained left parametrial fluid collection had resolved; the fluid collection at the right uterocervical junction remained unchanged. Results of liver-function tests were abnormal, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed multiple new intrahepatic fluid collections, which were hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging (Figure 1F).
Dr. Daniela Kroshinsky: The next day, new edematous, violaceous, friable plaques developed on the left upper arm at the site where a previous peripheral intravenous catheter had been inserted. A new erythematous-to-violaceous bulla on the left abdominal wall also developed. The plaques located on the left arm subsequently ulcerated (Figure 2A), as did new skin lesions located in the right inguinal crease and on the mons pubis. During the next 2 days, the bulla located on the left abdominal wall also began to ulcerate, and another similar lesion formed around the site where the percutaneous drainage catheter had been inserted. The ulcers involving the left upper arm, right inguinal crease, and mons pubis increased in area and depth, and a new ulcer formed in the left inguinal crease.
FIGURE 2

Clinical Photographs of the Lesion on the Left Upper Arm before and after Treatment.
Dr. Siegel: Treatment with intravenous furosemide was administered. Vancomycin was stopped, meropenem was continued, and daptomycin and micafungin were started.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Sweet’s syndrome.
Case 21-2024: A 10-Month-Old Boy with Vomiting and Hypercalcemia,"Dr. Andrew F. Cohen (Pediatrics): A 10-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of vomiting, weight loss, and hypercalcemia.
The patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when projectile vomiting began to occur once every few days, typically after eating solid foods. The vomiting did not seem to bother the patient, and he immediately returned to his normal activity after each episode. During the subsequent 12 days, the vomiting became more frequent, occurring daily, and had begun to occur after drinking liquids as well.
Two days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the pediatric primary care clinic of this hospital. On examination, the weight was 7.36 kg (0.4th percentile for his age) (Figure 1). The patient appeared alert, attentive, and comfortable but thin. The abdomen was soft, without distention or tenderness, and there was no evidence of organomegaly or masses on palpation. The skin was diffusely dry with excoriations. Treatment with omeprazole was started.
FIGURE 1

Growth Curves.
Over the course of the next 2 days, the patient lost interest in eating solid food and preferred milk and water. He gagged at the sight of food. The frequency of the vomiting had increased, occurring after the patient ate or drank anything.
On the day of this admission, the patient refused to take any food by mouth. His parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival, his parents reported that in the previous 2 weeks, he had had normal activity, wet diapers, and daily soft stools. They also noted that he always seemed thirsty, and when given liquid, he would drink a lot. At times, he would even suck the water out of the washcloths that were used to bathe him.
The patient had been born after induction of labor at 38 weeks’ gestation owing to maternal gestational hypertension. He had received routine newborn care and met normal developmental milestones. He maintained normal growth for his age until an evaluation at 9 months of age, when the weight was 7.44 kg (1.6th percentile), and the body length was 68.2 cm (6.5th percentile) (Figure 1). At a routine evaluation when he was 6 months of age, the weight was 7.39 kg (27.1st percentile), and the length was 66.7 cm (43.1st percentile). The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and eczema. Medications included omeprazole; he was not receiving any vitamins or supplements. He had no known drug allergies, and immunizations were up to date.
The patient lived with his mother and father in a suburban area of New England. His father had GERD and melanoma, and cardiomyopathy had led to heart transplantation 9 years earlier. His mother was well. The patient’s paternal grandmother had the Lynch syndrome and hyperparathyroidism. His maternal grandmother had diabetes and coronary artery disease, his maternal grandfather had hypertension and eczema, and his maternal uncle had the DiGeorge syndrome.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.1°C, the blood pressure 102/78 mm Hg, the pulse 140 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute. The patient was alert and appropriately interactive. He appeared thin. The abdomen was soft, and there was no distension or tenderness. The muscle tone was normal.
The blood calcium level was 13.2 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiographs of the wrists and knees were normal. The dose of omeprazole was increased. Treatment with famotidine and intravenous fluids was started. The patient was admitted to this hospital.

During the subsequent two hospital days, the patient was fed formula, and emesis continued to occur. Additional laboratory test results were obtained (Table 1). Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed a normal pylorus and no evidence of intussusception. Medullary nephrocalcinosis was present in both kidneys. An upper gastrointestinal series showed intermittent spasm of the gastric pylorus without evidence of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.
A diagnostic test was performed.",24-Hydroxylase deficiency due to a homozygous CYP24A1 variant.
Case 20-2024: A 73-Year-Old Man with Recurrent Fever and Liver Lesions,"Dr. Hayden S. Andrews (Medicine): A 73-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent fever.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 22 months before the current presentation, when 2 days of fever, cough, and fatigue developed. The patient sought evaluation at a primary care clinic affiliated with another hospital. Empirical oral antibiotic agents were administered to treat pneumonia. During the subsequent month, the cough resolved but fever recurred intermittently. The patient returned to the primary care clinic.
Dr. Rory L. Cochran: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed scattered solid pulmonary nodules, a few hepatic hemangiomas, and bilobar subcentimeter hepatic hypodensities (Figure 1A). There was borderline splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 13.0 cm in length (reference range, <13.2), and there was no lymphadenopathy.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies.
One week later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen (Figure 1B) revealed that the hepatic lesions, which appeared hyperintense on T2-weighted images with enhancement, had increased in number and size, measuring up to 2.4 cm in diameter. Some lesions were only enhanced peripherally, a finding that suggested central necrosis.
Dr. Andrews: A bone marrow biopsy and a liver biopsy were performed.
Dr. Emad I. Ababneh: Pathological examination of a bone marrow–biopsy specimen reportedly revealed normocellular bone marrow and rare nonnecrotizing granulomas. Pathological examination of the liver-biopsy specimen showed prominent portal histiocytosis and portal and lobular nonnecrotizing granulomas (Figure 2A), with detached neutrophilic aggregates; a few of these foci were fibrin-ring granulomas (Figure 2B). Special staining for acid-fast bacilli, Grocott’s methenamine silver staining, and Brown–Hopps staining were negative for organisms. Immunohistochemical staining for cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and spirochetes was negative. Langerin staining for Langerhans’ cells was negative.

Specimens from Liver and Bone Marrow Biopsies.
Dr. Andrews: Twenty months before the current presentation, the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital because of 2 days of intermittent fever, which often occurred with chills, night sweats, and abdominal discomfort.
Before the onset of this illness, the patient had no history of recurrent fever or severe bacterial infections. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease that had led to percutaneous coronary intervention of three vessels 12 years before the current presentation. He also had a history of hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and gallstone pancreatitis that had led to a cholecystectomy 9 years earlier. Medications included rosuvastatin, aspirin, ferrous sulfate, and a multivitamin. He had no known drug allergies.
The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his wife and pet cats and finches. He was a veteran who had been stationed in Guam, Thailand, and Japan, as well as in Vietnam 5 decades before the current presentation. He had traveled to the Southwest and Southeast regions of the United States 2 years before the current presentation. The patient was retired and had previously worked in the food-services industry. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, and he did not use alcohol or illicit drugs. His family history included idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, psoriasis, granuloma annulare, and chronic pancreatitis in his siblings. His son had iritis. There was no family history of frequent infections or early childhood deaths.
The temporal temperature was 37.3°C, the pulse 79 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The lungs were clear on auscultation. He had mild tenderness in the epigastrium, as well as splenomegaly. Leukopenia and anemia were present. The levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme, 1,3-β-d-glucan, and galactomannan were normal. Testing for infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B and C viruses was negative. Testing for infection with Chlamydia psittaci and Coxiella burnetii was also negative, as was testing for brucellosis, bartonellosis, listeriosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, malaria, babesiosis, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and ehrlichiosis.

Dr. Cochran: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed progressive increases in the number and size of the hepatic lesions (Figure 1C), which measured up to 3.0 cm in diameter. There was also splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 13.5 cm in length.
Dr. Ababneh: Pathological examination of a bone marrow–biopsy specimen (Figure 2C) and of a specimen obtained on fine-needle aspiration of the liver showed nonnecrotizing granulomas like those seen on the previous liver biopsy. Cytologic examination of the specimens and flow cytometry of the peripheral blood were normal.
Dr. Andrews: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed no valvular vegetations. Empirical doxycycline therapy was started, and the patient was discharged home.
During the subsequent 19 months, the patient continued to have intermittent fever, chills, and epigastric pain, which led to additional admissions to this hospital and the other hospital. During the second admission to this hospital, 19 months before this admission, empirical doxycycline therapy was stopped, and empirical prednisone therapy was started, along with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.
Dr. Cochran: During the third admission, 18 months before this admission, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed worsening splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 14.2 cm in length, and hepatic lesions that had increased in size and number. A percutaneous drain was placed in the largest hepatic lesion (Figure 1D), which measured 4.0 cm in diameter.
Dr. Andrews: Bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures of the drained fluid did not grow organisms; however, culture of the blood showed growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy, which revealed gastritis, esophagitis, and diverticulosis. Treatment with prednisone and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was stopped, intravenous ceftriaxone was started, and he was discharged home.
The patient’s fourth and fifth admissions occurred at the other hospital 17 months and 16 months before this admission, respectively. During the fourth admission, another percutaneous drain was placed in a dominant hepatic lesion, and cultures reportedly resulted in no growth. The patient received a course of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. During the fifth admission, cultures again reportedly showed no growth. The patient received another course of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and was discharged home with instructions to restart empirical doxycycline therapy.
Dr. Cochran: The sixth admission also occurred at the other hospital, 1 month before this admission. CT of the abdomen revealed numerous new and enlarged hypodense hepatic lesions with new scattered subcentimeter splenic hypodensities (Figure 1E).
Dr. Abahneh: Another liver biopsy was performed, which revealed liver parenchyma with abscess, acute inflammation and debris, and histiocytic and stromal reaction with histiocytic aggregates. Grocott’s methenamine silver staining showed few bacteria, and a culture grew Escherichia coli; no acid-fast bacilli or fungal forms were detected.
Dr. Andrews: Treatment with doxycycline was stopped, intravenous ceftriaxone was started, and the patient was discharged home with instructions to start taking ciprofloxacin. During the subsequent month, fever did not abate. The patient returned to this hospital for a seventh admission.
Dr. Cochran: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed stable scattered solid pulmonary nodules, new interstitial pulmonary edema, and increased splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 15.0 cm in length. There was also an increase in the size and number of the hepatic and splenic hypodensities (Figure 1F).
Dr. Andrews: The patient underwent EGD, which showed portal hypertensive gastropathy. TTE showed no vegetations. Aspiration of a hepatic lesion was performed, and a culture grew Enterococcus faecalis. Treatment with amoxicillin was started.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Common variable immunodeficiency.
Case 19-2024: A 46-Year-Old Man with Arthritis and Rash,"Dr. Christopher V. Radcliffe (Medicine): A 46-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of arthritis and rash.
One week before the current presentation, an episode of lightheadedness occurred when the patient stood up from a seated position. The episode was associated with diaphoresis and mild nausea; it lasted for a few minutes and resolved spontaneously. Four days later, another episode of lightheadedness occurred, and the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital.
The temporal temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 147/80 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Swelling of the wrists and ankles was present. The blood levels of glucose and electrolytes and the results of kidney-function tests were normal. The aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were normal; the alkaline phosphatase level was 157 U per liter (reference range, 45 to 115). The complete blood count with differential count was normal, as was the urinalysis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 104 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 14), the C-reactive protein level 6.3 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the d-dimer level 990 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500).
An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material timed to evaluate the pulmonary arteries, showed no pulmonary embolus or pulmonary nodules; there was no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Intravenous crystalloid solution was administered, and the lightheadedness resolved. Plans were made for an evaluation of the joint swelling and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the rheumatology clinic affiliated with this hospital. The patient was discharged home.
Three days later, the patient was seen in the rheumatology clinic. Additional history was obtained. Four months before the current presentation, mild coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) had developed after the patient had returned from a vacation in Central America and the Caribbean. Symptoms associated with Covid-19 resolved after 5 days. One week after the resolution of symptoms, and 14 weeks before the current presentation, pain and swelling of the wrists had developed. There was morning stiffness in both wrists and difficulty with forming a fist; the stiffness abated with activity and hot showers. The patient had had a partial response after the administration of topical diclofenac, acetaminophen, and plant-based topical applications for joint pain. He also had noted a sensation of instability in the ankles occurring toward the end of the day. In addition to the joint symptoms, a rash involving the chest, back, and legs had developed; the palms and soles were spared. The rash was mildly pruritic at night and nonpainful. Alopecia, anorexia, and an estimated 8 kg of weight loss had also occurred. Two weeks before the current presentation, nasal crusting had developed, and the patient had noted the presence of scant blood when using facial tissue.
The patient’s medical history was notable for asthma and eczema. Medications included topical triamcinolone and topical hydrocortisone. An unspecified allergy to diphenhydramine had been reported previously. The patient lived in Boston and worked in an office. He smoked a half pack of cigarettes and consumed two alcoholic beverages daily. There was no history of illicit drug use. He was sexually active with men; his most recent sexual activity, with a new partner, had occurred 5 months before the current presentation. His family history included psoriasis in his grandmother.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.5°C, the blood pressure 156/90 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Multiple small areas of alopecia were scattered throughout the scalp, and there was crusting in the distal nares. The left commissure of the mouth had an ulcerative lesion; there was no evidence of mucosal lesions or cervical lymphadenopathy. Swelling, warmth, and mild tenderness of the wrists and ankles were present. Swelling of several metacarpophalangeal joints was also present. There was a hyperpigmented, macular rash with scaling that involved the trunk (Figure 1), back, and legs, extending to the dorsal aspect of the feet. The heart rate was tachycardic but regular, without murmurs. The remainder of the examination was normal.

Case 18-2024: A 64-Year-Old Woman with the Worst Headache of Her Life,"Dr. Gabriella DiCarlo (Neurology): A 64-year-old woman was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of a sudden onset of the worst headache of her life.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until the evening of the current presentation, when she stood up to speak during a meeting for her condominium association. Bilateral, frontal, pulsatile headache developed suddenly and reached maximal intensity within seconds. The patient rated the pain at 10 (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain) and noted that it was the worst headache pain that she had ever had. The pain was so severe that she could not complete her sentence. She sat down, feeling as though she might faint because of the severity of the pain. She repeatedly told her husband, “Something is really wrong.” Nausea developed without emesis. When the symptoms did not abate after 30 minutes, emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
On arrival at the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing headache and nausea. Medical history included hypertension and cervical disk disease with chronic neck pain. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide and oral conjugated estrogens, which the patient took every 3 days for symptoms of menopause. She had no known allergies. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. She lived with her husband and worked as an administrative assistant. Her mother had diabetes. There was no family history of venous thromboembolism.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 157/77 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The neck was supple. She was oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. The visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The visualized portions of the retina were normal in both eyes with normal-appearing optic disks. Tests of motor strength and sensation showed normal results, as did tests of reflexes and cerebellar function. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count with differential count and the results of tests of kidney function and coagulation. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Javier M. Romero: Two hours after the onset of headache, computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1), revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left superior parietal lobule and paramedian parietal sulci.
FIGURE 1

CT Scan of the Head, Obtained during the Initial Presentation.
Dr. DiCarlo: Treatment with intravenous morphine and promethazine was administered. Nausea resolved, and the headache pain abated. Four hours after the onset of headache, the blood pressure was 136/45 mm Hg. Additional laboratory studies were obtained. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 8 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), the blood level of C-reactive protein 2.7 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the blood level of troponin T 0.36 ng per milliliter (reference value, <0.03). Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block and diffuse submillimeter ST-segment depressions.
Additional testing was performed, and a diagnosis was made.",Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Case 17-2024: A 45-Year-Old Woman with Metastatic Breast Cancer,"Dr. Kevin S. Oh (Radiation Oncology): A 45-year-old woman was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital because of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.
The patient had been well until 6 years before the current presentation, when she noticed a mass in the right breast. She was evaluated in the oncology clinic of another hospital, and mammography and ultrasonography of the right breast confirmed the presence of a mass. A core-needle biopsy was performed, and pathological examination of the specimen revealed invasive ductal carcinoma with no lymphovascular invasion. Lumpectomy of the right breast, along with sentinel-node biopsy of the right axilla, was performed.
Dr. Baris Boyraz: Pathological examination of the specimen that was obtained by means of lumpectomy confirmed the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient’s tumor was grade 3 (measuring 2.5 cm in diameter), negative for estrogen receptor, weakly positive (<5% of tumor cells) for progesterone receptor, and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), findings consistent with a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer. Three sentinel lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma, and there was no lymphovascular invasion. Genetic testing revealed no pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.
Dr. Oh: The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, followed by radiation therapy to the right breast. During the subsequent 3.5 years, surveillance imaging showed no evidence of disease recurrence.
Eighteen months before the current presentation, weakness and numbness developed in the left arm and resolved spontaneously after 15 minutes. During the subsequent 4 weeks, the patient had similar episodes of left-arm weakness and numbness, which occurred 1 or 2 times per week. When the episodes did not abate, she sought evaluation in the emergency department of the other hospital. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Karen Rodriguez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a partially cystic mass in the right precentral gyrus. The mass measured 3.5 cm in diameter, with peripheral enhancement and local mass effect.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies of the Head and Chest.
Dr. Oh: The patient was transferred to this hospital for neurosurgical management. The episodes of arm weakness and numbness were attributed to seizures; treatment with dexamethasone and levetiracetam was started. Right frontal craniotomy was performed, and the mass was resected.
Dr. Boyraz: Pathological examination of tissue obtained from the resected mass (Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C) revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive mitotic and apoptotic activity. The tumor cells had patchy positivity for GATA-3, a transcription factor expressed by breast tissue, which supported a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma originating in the breast. Further studies revealed the tumor to be estrogen-receptor–negative and progesterone-receptor–negative, with a HER2 score on immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of 1+ (incomplete, faint membrane staining in >10% of tumor cells), and programmed death ligand 1 expression of less than 1%, findings that are consistent with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Next-generation sequencing revealed variants in FOXL2, CCND3, TP53, and FLT3. An RNA fusion assay did not show fusion transcripts.
FIGURE 2

Biopsy Specimens of the Brain Mass and Lung.
Dr. Rodriguez: Positron-emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) (Figure 1B and 1C), performed after the administration of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, showed a conglomerate lymph-node mass in the right perihilar region with intense FDG avidity.
Dr. Oh: After surgery, the patient had an uneventful recovery, and the episodes of weakness and numbness resolved. She was discharged home with planned follow-up in the oncology clinic. Radiation therapy was administered to the brain, and treatment with capecitabine was initiated. However, 11 months before the current presentation, the episodes recurred. The dose of levetiracetam was increased, and additional imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Rodriguez: MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple new enhancing lesions with features consistent with metastasis, including a lesion in the right occipital lobe that measured 3 mm in diameter. Postsurgical changes related to the craniotomy on the right side and the resection of the mass in the right precentral gyrus were also present.
Dr. Oh: Stereotactic radiosurgery to the right occipital metastasis was performed.
Dr. Rodriguez: Seven months before the current presentation, PET-CT, performed after the administration of FDG tracer, showed an increase in the size of the right perihilar mass with intense FDG avidity, as well as new FDG avidity in a right lower paratracheal lymph node.
Dr. Oh: Treatment with capecitabine was discontinued. The patient was enrolled in a clinical trial, and treatment with oral paclitaxel was initiated (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03326102).
Dr. Rodriguez: Five months before the current presentation, MRI of the head revealed a new enhancing lesion in the right superior frontal gyrus, measuring 7 mm in diameter. The right occipital lesion was not seen.
Dr. Oh: The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to the right frontal metastasis. During the subsequent 5 months, treatment with oral paclitaxel was continued.
Two weeks before the current presentation, nonproductive cough developed. There was no shortness of breath, orthopnea, or chest pain. The patient had not had additional episodes of weakness and numbness in the left arm, and no headache or vision changes had occurred.
Other medical history included depression. Medications included oral paclitaxel, levetiracetam, paroxetine, prochlorperazine as needed for nausea, lorazepam as needed for anxiety, and acetaminophen as needed for musculoskeletal pain. Penicillin had caused rash. The patient was a teacher and lived with her husband and two children in a rural area of New England. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her maternal grandmother had died of leukemia, and her paternal grandfather had died of prostate cancer.
At the current presentation, the temporal temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 116/73 mm Hg, the heart rate 67 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were well-healed craniotomy and lumpectomy scars. The breasts had no skin changes, masses, or tenderness. There was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was normal. The complete blood count and the results of kidney-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, and globulin. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Rodriguez: MRI of the head revealed a new peripherally enhancing lesion in the left precentral gyrus, measuring 6 mm in diameter, as well as a new enhancing lesion in the right superior frontal gyrus, measuring 1 mm in diameter. Full-body PET-CT, performed after the administration of FDG tracer, showed enlargement of the conglomerate lymph-node mass in the right perihilar region, which was encasing the bronchus of the right upper lobe and occluding the bronchus of the right middle lobe. In addition, there was severe narrowing of the right superior pulmonary vein.
Dr. Oh: Treatment with oral paclitaxel was stopped, and the patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to the metastasis involving the left frontal lobe.
Management decisions were made.",Triple-negative breast cancer with metastasis to the lung and brain.
Case 16-2024: A 20-Year-Old Man with a Pustular Rash,"Dr. Erica S. Shenoy: A 20-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of a diffuse pustular rash that had progressed over a period of several days.
Three days before the current evaluation, the patient noticed a pustular rash on the left forearm that stung while he was taking a shower. He was a student athlete and was evaluated by an athletic trainer, who referred him to the student health clinic. The next day, the rash had progressed to involve the right arm. He received prescriptions for oral trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole and topical mupirocin.
The day before the current evaluation, the patient noticed an increased number of lesions, including new lesions on the chest, face, and ears. He consulted his primary care physician, who referred him to a dermatologist. The patient was unable to schedule a dermatology office visit, and the next day, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital.
In the emergency department, the patient reported that, despite topical and oral antimicrobial therapy, the rash had progressed and was very pruritic. He also stated that several days before the current evaluation, he had had close contact with another man with a similar rash. On a review of systems, he reported no fever, chills, night sweats, myalgia, cough, rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or neurologic symptoms.
Medical history was notable for oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, allergic rhinitis, patellar tendinosis, and tonsillectomy. Three years before the current evaluation, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection involving the right arm had been treated with topical antibiotic agents. Current medications included oral trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole and loratadine and inhaled albuterol as needed. He had no known drug allergies. He had received two vaccinations against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but had not received the vaccine against mpox because he had no risk factors for infection. There was no family history of infectious, dermatologic, rheumatologic, or oncologic conditions. The patient was a college student and lived in a dormitory on campus; he was on the college’s wrestling team. Previously, he had lived in a town in coastal Massachusetts but reported no other travel. He had a pet dog, but there were no other animal exposures. He was sexually active with women. He had a history of vaping but did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit substances.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2°C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/74 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was muscular; the weight was 77 kg. He had dozens of grouped, raised vesiculopustular lesions with erythematous bases at various stages of development; some of the lesions were more pustular, some were umbilicated, and others had a scab or eschar. Some areas of confluence were present. Lesions were found on the antecubital fossae, cheeks, and torso; similar lesions were scattered on the back, left axilla, lower right abdomen, calves, occiput, and posterior to the ears (Figure 1). There was erythema in intertriginous areas. The remainder of the examination was normal.

Case 15-2024: A 73-Year-Old Woman with Worsening Rash,"Dr. Tristan L. Lim (Medicine): A 73-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of worsening rash.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 8 days before the current presentation, when rectal pain developed. She sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Limited information describing the physical examination was available. The white-cell count was 19,700 per microliter (reference range, 4800 to 10,800), the absolute lymphocyte count 6500 per microliter (reference range, 1000 to 5000), the absolute eosinophil count 3150 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 500), the absolute monocyte count 590 per microliter (reference range, 200 to 1000), and the plasma lactate level 2.6 mmol per liter (23.4 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.4 to 2.0 mmol per liter [3.6 to 18.0 mg per deciliter]). The blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function and coagulation; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed a perianal collection measuring 1.8 cm in diameter. Attempts to aspirate the perianal collection were unsuccessful, and a punch biopsy was performed. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and intravenous piperacillin–tazobactam and vancomycin were administered.

On the second hospital day, examination of the punch-biopsy specimen reportedly showed no evidence of cancer. Rectal pain had abated, and the patient was discharged home to complete a course of amoxicillin–clavulanic acid and doxycycline.
Two days after discharge from the other hospital, and 4 days before the current presentation, an erosive rash developed on the skin of the groin, with associated pruritus and pain in the affected area of the skin. The patient had no fever or chills. Over the course of the next 3 days, the rash progressed to the perineum and lower abdomen. One day before the current presentation, the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of the other hospital. Skin breakdown and purulent drainage were reportedly present on the skin of the perineum, lower abdomen, and inframammary folds; the rash was estimated to involve 7% of the total body-surface area. Laboratory evaluation showed leukocytosis, lymphocytosis, and eosinophilia. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed a focus of inflammation and soft-tissue thickening, measuring 2.4 cm in diameter, in the left perianal area. The left pelvic sidewall, right external iliac, and right and left inguinal lymph nodes were enlarged, measuring up to 2.1 cm in diameter; the spleen was normal in size. A diagnosis of the Stevens–Johnson syndrome was considered, treatment with intravenous fluids and glucocorticoids was started, and the patient was transferred to this hospital for further care.
On arrival at this hospital, the patient reported that the skin was no longer pruritic or painful. No eye pain, dysuria, or vaginal pain was present. She had a history of eczema and psoriasis, which had been diagnosed 3 years before the current presentation. Treatment with acitretin and topical betamethasone, clobetasol, and triamcinolone had been started for psoriasis, and had shown some benefit. Her eczema had been treated with dupilumab but was stopped after 6 months owing to ophthalmic complications. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, anxiety, and genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The last flare of genital HSV had occurred 3 years before the current presentation and had been treated with valacyclovir. Other medications included amlodipine, doxepin, gabapentin, insulin glargine, insulin lispro, metoprolol, and risperidone; lorazepam was used as needed for anxiety. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was retired and had previously worked as a nursing assistant. She was Black and lived with her sister in a suburb of Boston; she had not traveled outside the United States. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Both parents had diabetes; there was no family history of recurrent infections.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 131/71 mm Hg, the pulse 99 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 17.2. There were multiple punched-out, monomorphic ulcers coalescing into ulcerative plaques on the skin of the axillae, inframammary folds, neck, lower abdomen, pubic area, and both medial thighs with associated purulent drainage and malodor (Figure 1). Onychodystrophy was present on the fingernails and toenails. The palmar and dorsal aspects of both hands had scaling, deep fissuring, and serous crusting. Subtle blanching erythema covered more than 90% of the body-surface area; she had not noticed this change, and she did not know the timing of onset. No oral or mucosal lesions were present. There was nontender axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was normal.
FIGURE 1

Clinical Photographs of the Skin Obtained on Presentation to This Hospital.
The blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The plasma level of lactate was 2.7 mmol per liter (24.3 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18.0 mg per deciliter]) and the blood level of C-reactive protein 130.9 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). The complete blood count with differential count was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
A sample of epidermal cells that was obtained from the base of an unroofed lesion was sent for HSV nucleic acid testing. Punch biopsies of the skin of the left axilla and the left upper arm were performed. A clinical diagnosis of Kaposi’s varicelliform eruption (KVE) with superinfection was considered, and treatment with intravenous acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin was started. The patient was admitted to this hospital.
On the second hospital day, the white-cell count had increased to 17,270 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), and the absolute eosinophil count had increased to 6820 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 900). The blood level of troponin was 7 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 9), the cobalamin level 345 pg per milliliter (255 pmol per liter; reference value, >231 pg per milliliter [>170 pmol per liter]), the tryptase level 4.5 ng per milliliter (reference value, <11.5), and the IgE level 25,113 IU per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 100). Serum protein electrophoresis showed a normal pattern with a moderate diffuse decrease in the globulin level. Antibodies to antinuclear antigens were detected at a dilution of 1:40. Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Preliminary examination of the two skin-biopsy specimens revealed changes consistent with HSV infection in the left axilla and a psoriasiform dermatitis in the left upper arm; there was no evidence of cutaneous involvement caused by a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Cultures that were obtained from one of the groin wounds grew moderate amounts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment with ceftriaxone was stopped, and treatment with intravenous cefepime was started.
Dr. Rory L. Cochran: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a multilobulated mass in the superior segment of the left lower lobe that extended beyond the left major fissure (Figure 2A), along with multiple additional bilateral pulmonary nodules of varying size (Figure 2B); there was marked bilateral axillary and subpectoral lymphadenopathy (Figure 2C). Abdominal and pelvic images were remarkable for mild superficial soft-tissue thickening along the intergluteal cleft immediately posterior to the anal verge (Figure 2D and 2E), as well as bilateral external iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy (Figure 2F).

"Case 14-2024: A 30-Year-Old Woman with Back Pain, Leg Stiffness, and Falls","Dr. Alba Coraini (Neurology): A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of back pain and leg stiffness.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 years before the current presentation, when stiffness in the back and upper legs developed abruptly while she attempted to rise from a seated position. She also began to have associated low back pain that worsened with bending the knees or climbing stairs. During the next several months, back and leg stiffness waxed and waned; at times, the patient could walk normally and engage in running for exercise, and at other times, she was unable to walk because her knees felt as though they had “locked up.” Two months after the onset of symptoms, the patient fell and broke her right arm. She perceived the fall as being unusual in that after she tripped, she was unable to prevent herself from falling because of tension in her legs. After the fall, the patient underwent physical therapy for several months, but she did not resume running for exercise because of a fear of falling.
Two and a half years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in a rheumatology clinic of another hospital. Passive flexion of the left knee was guarded, but the knee bent when a distraction technique was used; the remainder of the examination was normal. Hip and knee radiographs were reportedly unremarkable. The knee stiffness was not thought to be due to an underlying rheumatologic disorder.
One and a half years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated for knee pain in the sports medicine clinic affiliated with this hospital. The pain was localized to the anterior portions of the knees at the level of the patellae; it worsened with climbing stairs and resolved with rest. Examination and radiographs of the knees showed no abnormalities. Patellofemoral pain syndrome was diagnosed, and physical therapy was recommended. The knee pain resolved after physical therapy, but the patient continued to have leg stiffness and did not return to running owing to a fear of falling.
Three months before the current presentation, the patient noticed ongoing lower back pain and increased stiffness in the legs that was worse in the right leg. She felt unsteady on her feet and worried about tripping while walking or falling while climbing stairs. While walking in her house, she hit her leg on a coffee table; both legs stiffened, and she fell, striking her face on the floor. There was no loss of consciousness. She was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, she had mild tenderness on palpation of the lumbar spine. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed normal paraspinal soft tissues and exaggeration of the normal lumbar lordosis, with preserved vertebral height. A loss of normal signal intensity was noted in the L4–L5 intervertebral disk space on T2-weighted images, a finding that was consistent with mild degeneration. Evaluation for signal abnormality in the visible portion of the spinal cord and in the cauda equina nerve roots could not be assessed owing to severe motion artifact. There was no evidence of high-grade spinal canal or foraminal stenosis.
Dr. Coraini: Treatment with cyclobenzaprine, which was to be taken as needed at night for back pain, was initiated, and physical therapy was recommended. However, after 3 months of physical therapy, the back pain had not abated, and the leg stiffness had worsened. The patient sought evaluation in the neurology clinic of this hospital.
In the neurology clinic, the patient reported ongoing leg stiffness and rigidity that caused gait abnormalities. She noticed jerking movements at night as she was falling asleep. Three months before the current evaluation, she had taken lorazepam for claustrophobia before entering the MRI machine for spinal imaging, and her gait was reportedly normal for several hours after imaging.
The patient had a history of vitiligo, eczema, and alopecia areata. Graves’ disease, for which she had been treated with methimazole, was in remission. Immune thrombocytopenia, which had been diagnosed 7 years before the current presentation, had been treated with a course of intravenous immune globulin. In addition to cyclobenzaprine, medications included cetirizine, desogestrel–ethinyl estradiol, and a multivitamin. She had no known allergies. She lived in New England with her husband and had recently started a new job as an office manager. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. One sister had autoimmune thyroiditis, and another had alopecia areata.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 141/91 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.7. The patient appeared anxious but was in no acute distress. Strength was assessed as normal in the arms and legs. She had mildly increased tone in the legs; no fasciculations were present. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ in the arms and 3+ in the legs, with nonsustained clonus in the ankles. An exaggerated startle response was present. Sensation was normal. On ambulation, there was reduced flexion of the knees and a wide-based gait.
Blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of creatine kinase was 33 U per liter (reference range, 26 to 192), the C-reactive protein level 1 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 10), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 2 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Schaefer: MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1), was limited by motion artifact. No specific cord abnormality was identified. Mild degenerative changes were noted in the thoracolumbar spine, without moderate or severe narrowing of the spinal canal or neural foramina. No abnormal enhancement was seen. Possible atrophy of the posterior paraspinal musculature was detected in the lower lumbar spine. Exaggeration of the normal lumbar lordosis was noted.

Case 13-2024: A 27-Year-Old Man with Leg Weakness,"Dr. Jamie Aron (Emergency Medicine): A 27-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of leg weakness.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 days before the current presentation, when myalgias developed in the upper legs. He initially attributed the pain to increased physical activity while at work in construction. When he awoke on the morning of the current presentation, he could not lift his legs to move in bed or to stand up. He also had weakness in the arms, although it was less pronounced than the weakness in the legs. He asked his family to bring him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing weakness. He had no history of trauma, back pain, or saddle anesthesia. There were no changes in sensation. He had no other relevant medical history, and he took no prescribed medications. He had moved to Boston from El Salvador 5 months before the current presentation.
After arriving in Boston, the patient had begun to have increasing difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep, which he had attributed to stress. He had had loose stools but a normal appetite and was eating normally with no abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting; he estimated a weight loss of approximately 5 kg since moving to Boston. In addition, he reported that he had had trembling in his hands for several months before the current presentation, which he had also attributed to stress. Four days before the current presentation, he began taking an herbal supplement (sold under the brand name Nervitran) that was intended to reduce stress. He had no known allergies. He drank alcohol occasionally, had never smoked tobacco, and did not use illicit drugs. There was no family history of hypertension or liver disease; a maternal aunt had had an episode of weakness, but the patient was not aware of a diagnosis.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 144/79 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. Conjunctival injection was present in both eyes. Muscle strength was 4/5 on abduction of both shoulders and on flexion and extension of the elbows, wrists, and fingers. Muscle strength was 5/5 on knee flexion and extension and 3/5 on hip flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion. Sensation to light touch and temperature was normal. Patellar reflexes were 3+. There was a low-amplitude, high-frequency fine tremor in the hands, which was more prominent in the left hand than in the right hand. The remainder of the examination was normal.
The complete blood count was normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation. A blood toxicology screen was negative for salicylates, acetaminophen, ethanol, and tricyclic antidepressant medications. The blood level of aspartate aminotransferase was 56 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), the alanine aminotransferase level 65 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the alkaline phosphatase level 137 U per liter (reference range, 45 to 115), the total bilirubin level 1.3 mg per deciliter (22 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.0 to 1.0 mg per deciliter [0 to 17 μmol per liter]), the potassium level 1.8 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.0), the creatine kinase level 382 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400), and the aldolase level 9.9 U per liter (reference value, <7.7); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A urinalysis was not performed. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, incomplete right bundle-branch block, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Potassium chloride was administered orally at a dose of 60 meq. Three hours later, the blood level of potassium was 4.2 mmol per liter, and the weakness in the patient’s arms and legs had abated.

"Case 12-2024: A 58-Year-Old Woman with Confusion, Aphasia, and Abnormal Head Imaging","Dr. Lena G. Liu (Neurology): A 58-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of progressively worsening confusion and evolving changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 16 months before the current presentation, when confusion and expressive and auditory aphasia developed. She was evaluated at another hospital. The findings of computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck were reportedly normal. MRI of the head reportedly showed signal hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed elevated levels of glucose and protein with a normal cell count; nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus DNA was negative. Blood and CSF paraneoplastic autoantibody and autoimmune encephalopathy panels were unrevealing. The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Screening tests for syphilis and antinuclear antibodies were negative. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized slowing, with no epileptiform discharges. A diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis was considered, and treatment included intravenous glucocorticoids for 5 days, followed by treatment with daily oral prednisone. Expressive aphasia resolved and confusion abated, but auditory aphasia persisted.
CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a mass measuring 5 cm in diameter in the pelvis that was composed of fat, soft tissue, and calcifications. Laparotomy was performed, and pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with a mature cystic teratoma. The patient was discharged home after a 3-week hospitalization, with a plan to taper the dose of oral prednisone after discharge.
One week after the patient’s discharge from the other hospital, after the dose of prednisone had been decreased, malaise developed and confusion recurred. The patient was readmitted to the other hospital. MRI of the head reportedly showed a decrease in the left temporal lobe hyperintensities relative to the previous imaging study. The dose of prednisone was increased, confusion again abated, and the patient was discharged home. The dose of glucocorticoids was gradually tapered.
Six months before the current presentation, confusion recurred, and the patient was readmitted to the other hospital. Imaging studies were performed.
Dr. Otto Rapalino: MRI of the head reportedly showed progression of the signal hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe on T2-weighted FLAIR images.
Dr. Liu: A diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis was again considered. Treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids was reinitiated, which resulted in some reduction in confusion. The patient was discharged home with instructions to continue oral prednisone therapy, with a plan to again gradually taper the dose.
Three months before the current presentation, confusion recurred. The patient was again admitted to the other hospital, and imaging studies were repeated.
Dr. Rapalino: MRI of the head reportedly showed progression of the hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe and new signal hyperintensities in the right temporal and left occipital lobes.
Dr. Liu: Treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab was initiated. The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility, with a plan for weekly rituximab infusions for 5 weeks and a 6-week tapering course of daily oral prednisone therapy. Confusion resolved and did not recur.
Dr. Rapalino: Three weeks before the current presentation, MRI of the head, which was performed to evaluate the response to immunosuppressive medications, reportedly showed hyperintensity in both temporal lobes, with extension to the anterior aspects of the parietal lobes, on T2-weighted FLAIR images. Enhancement involving the subinsular regions was present, along with restricted diffusion in the insular cortexes. Positron-emission tomography (PET)–CT of the skull base to the midthighs reportedly showed no abnormalities.
Dr. Liu: Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by her neurologist in the clinic, who recommended admission to the hospital for additional treatment owing to the progressively worsening findings on head imaging. One week before the current presentation, she was admitted to the other hospital. Treatment included daily intravenous immunoglobulin for 5 days and mycophenolate mofetil. On the third hospital day, she fell and struck her forehead while walking to the bathroom. On the sixth hospital day, she was transferred to this hospital to potentially undergo a brain biopsy.
On arrival at this hospital, the patient reported pain on her forehead where she had struck her head during her fall. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sensorineural hearing loss (which had been diagnosed when she was 45 years of age), and depression. The results of a routine screening colonoscopy that had been performed 4 years before the current presentation had been normal. In additional to mycophenolate mofetil and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, medications included ascorbic acid, cholecalciferol, glipizide, magnesium oxide, metoprolol, omeprazole, sertraline, and thiamine. Treatment with metformin had been stopped at the other hospital because the blood level of lactate had been 12.4 mmol per liter (112 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18 mg per deciliter]) on presentation. There were no known drug allergies. She had worked in health care until the onset of neurologic symptoms 16 months earlier. Before being discharged to the skilled nursing facility, she had lived alone. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had diabetes and had died from heart disease at 59 years of age; she had used hearing aids. Her father had died from heart disease at 78 years of age. Both her brothers had diabetes, along with hearing loss in both ears.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 154/90 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 157.5 cm, the weight 34 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 13.7. Ecchymoses and a healing laceration were present on the right side of the forehead. The patient had receptive aphasia, which severely limited her ability to understand oral speech, but she could comprehend written or typed questions. She was alert and interactive and oriented to person, place, and time. Her speech was fluent, with no paraphasic errors. She was able to follow simple and complex commands without difficulty. Concentration and attention were intact. No abnormalities involving the cranial nerves were noted, with the exception of anisocoria; the left pupil measured 5 mm in diameter, and the right pupil measured 3 mm in diameter. Both pupils were reactive to light. The muscle bulk was decreased, but muscle tone and strength were normal. Tests of sensation, deep-tendon reflexes, and cerebellar function showed normal results.
The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The blood level of lactate was 2.6 mmol per liter. The complete blood count with differential count was normal, except for the level of hemoglobin (11.3 g per deciliter; reference range, 12.0 to 16.0).
Diagnostic tests were performed.","MIDD (maternally inherited diabetes and deafness) and MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes) associated with the m.3243A→G pathogenic variant."
Case 11-2024: An 82-Year-Old Woman with Falls and Cognitive Decline,"Dr. Will Pohlman (Medicine): An 82-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of difficulty walking, falls, and cognitive decline.
The patient had been in her usual state of health, living independently with her husband and participating in a walking club, until 8 months before the current presentation, when generalized weakness developed. She began to walk more slowly and was no longer active with her walking club; she felt limited by pain in her feet.
Five months before the current presentation, the patient began to have difficulty with climbing stairs and with rising from a seated position. Four months before the current presentation, she began to have falls at home.
Three months before the current presentation, the patient fell and her husband was not able to lift her up from the floor. Emergency medical services were called, and she was admitted to another hospital for evaluation. During that hospitalization, a urinary tract infection and hyponatremia were diagnosed. The urinary tract infection was treated with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. The hyponatremia was attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone and was treated with fluid restriction and salt tablets. The use of a walker was recommended, and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. After 3 weeks in the rehabilitation facility, she was discharged home, but she fell again at home and subsequently returned to the other hospital for evaluation. She was readmitted to the other hospital and again discharged to a rehabilitation facility.
Eight weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from the rehabilitation facility, and she and her husband moved to an assisted-living facility. Fatigue developed, along with loss of appetite and a reduced intake of food. The patient began to need one-person assistance to walk. She also noticed that she had been having difficulty with math associated with the family finances, which she had always done with ease. Her family noticed that she had been having trouble carrying on a conversation and that she seemed less attentive than usual.
Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient had another fall and was admitted to a second hospital, where she was found to have hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head reportedly showed moderate chronic small-vessel ischemic changes and ventriculomegaly. Increased food intake was encouraged, and outpatient evaluation in the neurology clinic affiliated with the second hospital was arranged. Discharge to a rehabilitation facility was recommended, but after discussions between the patient and her family, the patient returned to the assisted-living facility.
After discharge from the hospital, the patient had a progressive loss of independence. She noted worsening generalized weakness and low back pain, and she needed two-person assistance to walk. Her family brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported urinary incontinence, which she attributed to not having enough time to get to the toilet because of her physical limitations with movement; she had no dysuria or urinary urgency. There was no fecal incontinence.
The patient had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. Surgical history included hemiarthroplasty of the right shoulder and arthroplasty of both knees. She had chronic pain in the shoulders, knees, wrists, and hands, which had been attributed to osteoarthritis; the knee and shoulder pain had decreased after the surgeries but then returned during the year before the current presentation. Medications included atorvastatin, calcium citrate, levothyroxine, lisinopril, and tramadol. She had no known drug allergies. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. In addition to her husband, her support network included four children who lived near the assisted-living facility. She was retired and had previously worked in finance. Her mother had had diabetes, and her father had had thyroid cancer; there was no known family history of dementia or neurodegenerative disorders.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/54 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. She appeared tired but was oriented to person and place. Pitting edema was present in the legs to the level of the mid-shins. A detailed strength examination was limited because of pain, with minimal movement of the shoulders, wrists, fingers, ankles, and knees. The patient could wiggle her toes but had weak plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of both feet. She could easily wiggle her fingers and lift her arms against gravity at the elbows. Light touch of the dorsum of the right hand caused pain, as did light touch of the right knee and the soles of both feet. Recognition of sensation to light touch and to vibration were normal. Cerebellar testing, gait testing, and reflex testing were limited by severe pain with movement and touch. The patient had symmetric erythema, swelling, and tenderness of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. She had limited range of motion in the wrists and elbows, along with symmetric tenderness in the subtalar joints and swelling and pain with squeezing of the metatarsophalangeal joints.
The blood levels of alcohol, ammonia, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and urine toxicology screening; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 3+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative) and the presence of nitrates (reference value, negative), and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). Urine was obtained for culture, and intravenous ceftriaxone was administered. Imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Ambrose J. Huang: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed moderate ventriculomegaly that was out of proportion to the enlargement of the cerebral sulci (Figure 1).
FIGURE 1

CT of the Head.
Dr. Pohlman: A high-volume lumbar puncture with gait evaluation before and after the procedure was not possible, given the patient’s inability to walk unassisted. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus was generally thought to be unlikely to explain her presentation. Altered mental status was attributed to delirium in the context of tramadol use and urinary tract infection. The patient was admitted to the hospital.
On hospital day 2, the urine culture grew Citrobacter farmeri; treatment with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was started. MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was terminated early because of the patient’s pain, and the images that were obtained were degraded by motion artifacts. However, no marked signal abnormality in the spinal cord or high-grade spinal or foraminal stenosis was observed. Additional laboratory studies were obtained. Tests for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus antibodies, and hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative. The blood levels of glycated hemoglobin and cobalamin were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation; blood samples were obtained for measurement of copper and vitamin B6 levels. Treatment with gabapentin was started for neuropathic pain. On hospital day 3, pain had not decreased, and the dose of gabapentin was increased.
Dr. Bart K. Chwalisz: On hospital day 4, electromyography and nerve conduction studies were performed. The amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was normal with stimulation of the right tibial nerve but was reduced with stimulation of the left tibial nerve and both peroneal nerves; in addition, the CMAP amplitude of the left ulnar nerve was mildly reduced, and that of the left median nerve was normal. The sensory-nerve action potential of the left radial nerve was normal, but the sensory-nerve action potential of the left sural nerve could not be obtained. The conduction velocities and distal latencies were normal. There was no abnormal spontaneous activity in any muscle examined. The motor-unit action potentials and motor-unit recruitment with voluntary activation were normal throughout.
Dr. Pohlman: The results of the additional blood tests became available. The copper level was normal, and the vitamin B6 level was less than 2 μg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50). Treatment with vitamin B6 supplementation was started.
Additional diagnostic tests were performed.",Rheumatoid arthritis with vasculitis causing a confluent mononeuritis multiplex.
Case 10-2024: A 46-Year-Old Woman with Hyperglycemia Refractory to Insulin Therapy,"Dr. Kaitlyn R. Shank (Medicine): A 46-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of hyperglycemia that was refractory to insulin therapy.
Five years before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus after nausea, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia had developed. At that time, the weight was 113 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 45.6. Treatment with metformin was started, along with subcutaneous insulin glargine at a dose of 10 units daily. The patient had adverse effects associated with metformin, so treatment with metformin was discontinued and glipizide was started. During the next 3.5 years, despite progressive weight loss, the patient’s glycemic control worsened, which resulted in gradual intensification of her glucose-lowering regimen.
Two years before the current presentation, the patient moved to the Boston area and established care at a clinic affiliated with another hospital. The weight was 63 kg, and the BMI was 25.4. Medications for diabetes included subcutaneous insulin glargine (20 units daily) and glipizide, and the glycated hemoglobin level was 13.2% (reference range, 4.3 to 5.6). Treatment with empagliflozin was started but then stopped because of a urinary tract infection. The dose of subcutaneous insulin glargine was increased to 30 units daily, and treatment with subcutaneous insulin lispro, administered at a dose of 10 units three times a day with meals, was added. Treatment with glipizide was stopped, and treatment with glimepiride and pioglitazone was started.
One year before the current presentation, the weight was 48 kg, and the BMI was 19.4. Medications for diabetes included subcutaneous insulin glargine (34 units daily), subcutaneous insulin lispro (15 units three times a day with meals), glimepiride, and pioglitazone, and the glycated hemoglobin level was 14.0%. Anorexia had developed, along with fatigue. Although the patient reported eating very little, the blood glucose levels remained markedly elevated.
Nine months before the current presentation, the weight was 42 kg, and the BMI was 16.9. Medications for diabetes included subcutaneous insulin glargine (46 units daily), subcutaneous insulin lispro (20 units three times a day with meals), glimepiride, and pioglitazone, and the glycated hemoglobin level was 11.0%.
Six months before the current presentation, persistent abdominal pain developed, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly did not show evidence of obstruction, perforation, or abscess. The abdominal pain was attributed to gastroparesis; treatment with gabapentin, metoclopramide, and oxycodone was started. During the hospitalization, the patient was found to have profound hyperglycemia without diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome. The glycated hemoglobin level was 15.5%. Testing was negative for antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase, islet antigen 2, and zinc transporter 8. A diagnosis of lipodystrophy was considered. Treatment with human regular U-500 insulin, given in daily doses of 250 units with breakfast and 200 units each with lunch and dinner, was started; treatment with subcutaneous insulin glargine and subcutaneous insulin lispro was stopped. The patient was discharged home. Subsequent to this hospitalization, a gastric-emptying study reportedly showed normal emptying at 1 hour.
Two months before the current presentation, the abdominal pain worsened, and the patient was again admitted to the other hospital. Her hyperglycemia was initially treated with continuous intravenous insulin at doses of up to 40 units per hour. When the blood glucose level improved, treatment with intravenous insulin was stopped. Treatment with human regular U-500 insulin was then resumed at an increased dose (550 units each with breakfast and lunch and 450 units with dinner); treatment with isophane insulin, also known as neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, was started at a dose of 80 units twice a day. The abdominal pain subsided with improved glycemic control, and the patient was discharged home.
Over the course of the 2 months between hospital discharge and the current presentation, the patient had five additional admissions to the other hospital because of abdominal pain and hyperglycemia. During each admission, the hyperglycemia was treated with high-dose intravenous insulin, the abdominal pain abated with improved blood glucose levels, and the patient was discharged home. During one admission, endoscopy was performed and reportedly revealed erosive gastritis and duodenitis due to infection with Helicobacter pylori, for which the patient was treated with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, bismuth subsalicylate, and pantoprazole.
Nine days before the current presentation, the abdominal pain worsened, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of the other hospital. Treatment with intravenous insulin was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, treatment with intravenous insulin was stopped, and treatment with human regular U-500 insulin was resumed at an increased dose of 650 units each with breakfast and lunch and 600 units with dinner; treatment with NPH insulin was also restarted at a dose of 80 units twice a day. She was transferred to this hospital for further care.
On arrival at this hospital, the patient reported constant epigastric abdominal pain. She also reported that she had been administering her subcutaneous insulin medications at home without missed doses and confirmed that she had been rotating the injection sites on her abdomen. Other medical history included depression, as well as anemia and leukopenia; a bone marrow biopsy performed 7 months earlier revealed mild-to-moderate fibrosis with patchy myxoid degeneration. She had numbness and tingling in the hands and feet that had begun 9 months before the current presentation. Her menses had stopped 14 months before the current presentation. Other medications included acetaminophen, fluoxetine, gabapentin, glipizide, hydromorphone, lorazepam, mirtazapine, oxycodone, pancrelipase, pantoprazole, and pioglitazone. She had no known drug allergies. The patient was Black and lived in Boston with her husband and children; she had previously worked as a chef but was not working at the time of the current presentation. She rarely drank alcohol or smoked marijuana and had never smoked tobacco; she did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes, and her father had liver disease.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.1°C, the blood pressure 108/78 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 42 kg, and the BMI was 17.0. The patient appeared cachectic with a diffuse absence of body fat and muscle mass. Her face had acromegaly-like features, including broadening of the nose and thickening of the lips (Figure 1). Acanthosis nigricans was present, most notably in the neck and axillae. She had skin tags on the face and neck, and vitiligo was present on the ears and on the fingers of the right hand. The abdomen was soft, nondistended, and diffusely tender on palpation, without rebound or guarding; there was no hepatosplenomegaly. There was skin breakdown in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal.

Clinical Photographs.
Laboratory testing showed a fasting blood glucose level of 311 mg per deciliter (17.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 100 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter]) and a C-peptide level of 12.1 ng per milliliter (reference range, 1.1 to 4.4). Blood levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, total complement, C3, and C4 were normal. The blood level of leptin was undetectable, and the blood level of adiponectin was 24.5 μg per milliliter (reference range, 2.9 to 30.4). A screening test for human immunodeficiency virus was negative. Testing for antibodies to nuclear antigens was positive at a titer of 1:320 with a homogeneous pattern; testing for antibodies to double-stranded DNA was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a normal pattern with a mild diffuse increase in the gamma globulin level. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were performed.

Dr. Leo L. Tsai: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a near-complete absence of both visceral and subcutaneous fat, with multiple skin folds reflecting a clinically significant lack of fat (Figure 2). There was no bowel dilatation. The pancreas was atrophic, a finding commonly seen in patients with chronic insulin-dependent diabetes.1 There were bilateral, nonobstructing renal stones measuring up to 3 mm in diameter. The attenuation level of the liver was 58 Hounsfield units (HU), which is not consistent with hepatic steatosis (which is usually defined by an attenuation level of <40 HU).2 A nonspecific, round 3.3-cm hypodense lesion at the upper aspect of the spleen was noted.

Case 9-2024: An 84-Year-Old Man with a Fall,"Dr. Kathleen M. McFadden (Medicine): An 84-year-old man was admitted to this hospital after having a fall.
Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital because of a transient episode of gross hematuria. Urinalysis showed trace blood (reference value, negative), and microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed 4 or 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 3). Results of tests of coagulation were normal, and the complete blood count showed anemia, which had been diagnosed previously and was stable as compared with findings obtained 11 months earlier. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed a linear density in the bladder that measured 10 mm in diameter. The cause of the episode of hematuria was thought to be a kidney stone that had passed into the bladder. The patient was discharged home with a plan to follow up in the urology clinic affiliated with the other hospital; he was instructed to continue treatment with rivaroxaban, which he had been taking for many years to prevent stroke in the context of atrial fibrillation.
One week before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of the other hospital after he had expressive aphasia as well as numbness on the right side of his face and in his right arm, which had resolved before he arrived at the emergency department. He had missed multiple doses of rivaroxaban in the 2 weeks before the onset of these symptoms. CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly did not show evidence of stroke or clinically significant stenosis in the anterior or posterior cerebral circulation. The complete blood count showed that his anemia remained stable. The blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 1+ blood, and microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed 6 to 10 red cells per high-power field and 6 to 9 white cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2).

The patient was admitted to the other hospital. On hospital day 2, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed moderate generalized atrophy and small-vessel ischemic changes. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%, increased estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and intact intraventricular and atrial septa. The patient was told that his symptoms were due to a transient ischemic attack, and he was discharged home with instructions to continue taking rivaroxaban and with a plan to follow up in the neurology clinic affiliated with the other hospital.
On the day of the current presentation, the patient fell in his bathroom at his home. Emergency medical services were called. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 130 mg per deciliter (7.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 100 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). The patient was not able to recall the events that led to the fall. He was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported that he had felt unwell after discharge from the other hospital, with symptoms including generalized weakness and dizziness. He had no abdominal pain, chest pain, or urinary symptoms. His wife reported that before the patient’s admission to the other hospital, he had been completely independent, performing activities such as driving and grocery shopping. However, since his discharge from the other hospital, he had become progressively weaker and had required assistance with walking and dressing. The patient’s wife also reported an area of redness on the patient’s left arm where an intravenous catheter had been placed during admission to the other hospital.
Other medical history included atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, hypertension, and prostate cancer that had been treated with radiotherapy. Medications included amlodipine, finasteride, furosemide, losartan, rivaroxaban, rosuvastatin, and venlafaxine. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs; he smoked one pack of cigarettes per day. He was retired and lived in Massachusetts with his wife.
The temporal temperature was 36.1°C, the blood pressure 145/68 mm Hg, the pulse 61 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.4. The patient appeared ill with dry mucous membranes. The heart sounds were irregular. There was an area of erythema overlying the left antecubital fossa with mild induration but no fluctuance. He had an abrasion over the left knee. He was cooperative but confused and intermittently answered questions inappropriately; he occasionally stared off into space and did not respond to questions. The remainder of the examination was normal.
The blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation. Urinalysis showed 3+ blood (reference value, negative) and 3+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative); microscopic evaluation of the urinary sediment revealed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2), more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10), and 1+ bacteria. The blood level of creatinine was 2.01 mg per deciliter (178 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]) and the blood level of high-sensitivity troponin T 68 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, were negative. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Brian B. Ghoshhajra: CT angiography of the head and cervical spine showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of an acute infarct and no acute fracture in the cervical spine. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also performed. A small pleural effusion was detected in the left lung (Figure 1A). Moderate-to-severe coronary-artery calcification with multichamber cardiomegaly was present, and calcifications were scattered throughout the thoracic aorta, which showed aneurysmal dilatation (Figure 1D). An indeterminate left adrenal nodule that measured 15 mm in diameter was detected, along with circumferential wall thickening in the urinary bladder and two stones in the urinary bladder that measured up to 5 mm in diameter; seeds from previous brachytherapy were also visible (Figure 1C). Two focal areas of hyperdensity, each measuring up to 6 mm in diameter, that were seen along the posterior aspect of the spinal canal at the level of the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae were most likely meningiomas (Figure 1A and 1B). There was a focal outpouching of the aorta superior to the origin of the celiac artery and mural thickening of the aorta at the level of the aortic hiatus with adjacent fat stranding (Figure 1D).

Dr. McFadden: While the patient was in the emergency department, the high-sensitivity troponin T levels, which were checked 1 and 3 hours after the initial troponin measurement, were 71 ng per liter and 70 ng per liter, respectively. A bolus of 500 ml of normal saline was administered. A presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection was made, and urine was obtained for culture. Treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with furosemide and losartan was stopped, but his other home medications were continued.
On hospital day 1, the urine culture grew more than 100,000 colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus. MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was degraded by motion artifact, but there was no evidence of an acute infarct. A TTE showed an LVEF of 60%, a dilated right ventricle with normal systolic function, mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and an elevated estimated right ventricular systolic pressure. Blood was obtained for culture, and treatment with ceftriaxone was continued.
On hospital day 2, the patient remained afebrile. An ultrasound image of the left antecubital fossa showed an avascular hypoechoic collection, measuring 1.7 cm by 0.5 cm by 1.3 cm, overlying a partially occluded superficial vein. The patient was evaluated by the orthopedic surgery consultant; no surgical intervention was recommended. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the urine culture isolate revealed methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Treatment with ceftriaxone was stopped, and treatment with intravenous vancomycin and cefazolin was initiated. Blood cultures obtained on hospital day 1 grew gram-positive cocci in clusters in one of four bottles. Additional blood cultures were obtained.
On hospital day 3, the patient had sudden chest pain while resting in bed. The pain was located over the left third intercostal space and did not radiate; the patient rated the pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain lasted 5 minutes and resolved without intervention. On evaluation by the treating physician immediately after the pain resolved, the blood pressure was 193/80 mm Hg. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes. A chest radiograph showed a small left pleural effusion similar to that previously seen on CT angiography and a confluent retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe. The blood level of high-sensitivity troponin T was 46 ng per liter. Treatment with losartan, which had been stopped on admission to the hospital, was restarted. During the next 12 hours, the blood pressure decreased to 167/81 mm Hg.
On hospital day 4, the patient had chest pain that was different in character from the pain he had had the previous day. The pain, which he rated at 10, radiated into the abdomen. The patient appeared distressed. The blood pressure was 173/85 mm Hg. The pain was unchanged on palpation over the chest and abdomen. Treatment with low-dose intravenous hydromorphone was initiated, and the pain decreased to 5 out of 10. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
A diagnostic test was performed, and management decisions were made.",Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and infectious aortic pseudoaneurysm.
"Case 8-2024: A 55-Year-Old Man with Cardiac Arrest, Cardiogenic Shock, and Hypoxemia","Dr. Man Piu Wong: A 55-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital after a witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
The patient had been eating at a restaurant late at night when he lost consciousness. A first responder used an automated external defibrillator to deliver a shock, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. Four minutes later, emergency medical services identified ventricular fibrillation, and defibrillation was performed. Intravenous amiodarone and epinephrine and intranasal naloxone were administered. Unstable ventricular tachycardia occurred, and the patient underwent cardioversion. He was transported to the emergency department of this hospital. The results of electrocardiography (ECG) performed before arrival at the hospital were suggestive of inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.
A review of systems could not be performed. The patient had no known medical history. He was not known to take any medications. He reportedly lived alone, worked in the service industry, and did not use tobacco or drink alcohol. His family history was unknown.
On the patient’s arrival at the emergency department, the heart rate was 123 beats per minute, the blood pressure 188/107 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a bag–valve–mask device at a rate of 15 liters per minute. The weight was 73 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.0. The patient was awake but not oriented. He did not spontaneously move the arms or legs or respond to tactile stimuli; he had increased work of breathing and posturing. The pupils were 3 mm in diameter and sluggishly reactive. Auscultation revealed sinus tachycardia and diffuse lung crackles. There was no leg edema. The remainder of the examination was normal.
Dr. Ada C. Stefanescu Schmidt: ECG showed sinus tachycardia, Q waves and 2-mm ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads, and upsloping ST-segment depressions in the lateral and precordial leads (Figure 1A).
FIGURE 1

Initial Cardiopulmonary Diagnostic Studies.
Dr. Wong: Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The white-cell count and differential count were normal, as were the levels of magnesium, bilirubin, and globulin. The high-sensitivity troponin T level was 3169 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14), and the N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level was 5679 pg per milliliter (reference value, <900). Urinalysis showed 3+ blood and 5 erythrocytes per high-power field. Blood was obtained for culture.

Intravenous norepinephrine and vasopressin were administered. Bedside ultrasonography revealed bilateral lung sliding and reduced left ventricular function. The trachea was intubated, and the oxygen saturation was 88% while the patient was receiving mechanical ventilation on a volume-controlled mode (tidal volume, 440 ml; respiratory rate, 20 breaths per minute; positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP], 14 cm of water; fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio2], 1.0).
Dr. Milena Petranovic: Portable chest radiography (Figure 1B) revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, as well as diffuse interstitial opacities in both lungs and an asymmetric consolidation in the right upper lobe. Endotracheal and enteric tubes were in appropriate positions, and multiple metallic densities related to a previous gunshot injury were projected over the left hemithorax.
Dr. Stefanescu Schmidt: Unstable ventricular tachycardia recurred, and defibrillation was performed. Emergency cardiac catheterization was performed, and a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was placed through the right femoral artery. Coronary angiography (Figure 1C) revealed a thrombotic occlusion of the right coronary artery, as well as 60 to 70% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and a diagonal branch. The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 34 mm Hg. Intraprocedural transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed a dilated, hypokinetic left ventricle with akinesis of the inferior and septal walls. Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation were present, and there was no pericardial effusion.
The thrombosis of the right coronary artery was difficult to wire and cross. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was undertaken with the use of two drug-eluting stents in the middle and distal portions of the right coronary artery. Ventricular tachycardia recurred before reperfusion, and the patient underwent two cardioversions. Intravenous cangrelor, heparin, amiodarone, vancomycin, and cefepime were administered. Data from pulmonary artery catheterization, performed after PCI, are shown in Table 2. After the initiation of treatment with the percutaneous LVAD and reperfusion of the right coronary artery, the patient received low-dose norepinephrine.

Dr. Wong: The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit early on the morning of the second hospital day. The temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the heart rate 98 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 81/72 mm Hg while he was receiving intravenous norepinephrine at a rate of 4 μg per minute and maximal support from the percutaneous LVAD. The oxygen saturation was 92% while he was receiving mechanical ventilation on a volume-controlled mode. The heart sounds were tachycardic and distant and were obscured by the mechanical hum of the LVAD. There was bleeding at the site of the right femoral arteriotomy. The arms and legs were cool. When sedation was temporarily discontinued, the pupils were sluggishly reactive, without corneal reflexes or blinking in response to threat; there was no response to noxious stimuli, and the plantar reflexes were mute.
A screening test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was positive, and intravenous dexamethasone and remdesivir were administered. Aspirin was also administered. Results from laboratory testing and hemodynamic monitoring are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. The protocol for temperature management after cardiac arrest was initiated.
Dr. Petranovic: Chest radiography showed that the endotracheal tube, cardiac catheter, percutaneous LVAD, and enteric tube were in appropriate positions. There were diffuse alveolar opacities, which were greater on the left side than the right side, as well as a left pleural effusion.
Dr. Wong: During the 6 hours after admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, the blood pressure decreased to 74/72 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous norepinephrine at a rate of 9 μg per minute and maximal support from the percutaneous LVAD. The urine output decreased, and the cardiac index measured by means of thermodilution was 1.7 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area; other results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Treatment with intravenous epinephrine was initiated at a rate of 2 μg per minute. The oxygen saturation was 81% while he was receiving mechanical ventilation; intravenous cisatracurium and inhaled nitric oxide were administered.
By the afternoon, the patient was anuric. On examination, there was a systolic murmur, and the arms and legs remained cool and were mottled. He received doses of intravenous epinephrine at a rate of up to 5 μg per minute, and the blood pressure was 70/66 mm Hg. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.
Diagnostic test results were received, and management decisions were made",Inferior myocardial infarction with ventricular septal rupture and acute papillary muscle rupture.
Case 7-2024: A 67-Year-Old Woman with Alternating Sixth Cranial Nerve Palsy,"Dr. Zandra E. Walton (Medicine): A 67-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of headache and retro-orbital pain.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 10 months before the current admission, when a photosensitive, erythematous, papular rash developed on the forearms a few weeks after she had started treatment with hydrochlorothiazide. Over the next 7 months, an intermittent, painless, nonpruritic, erythematous, annular rash developed on the trunk and the proximal portions of the arms and legs.
Three months before the current presentation, the rashes worsened, and the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist at another hospital. The thyrotropin level was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of a punch-biopsy specimen of abdominal skin reportedly showed spongiotic dermatitis with superficial perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory-cell infiltrate with eosinophils; neither vasculitis nor dermal mucin was found. The rashes were thought to be related to medication; treatment with amlodipine was started, and hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. She was treated with topical triamcinolone ointment. The photosensitive rash on the forearms resolved, and the annular rash on the trunk abated.

Ten days after the evaluation at the first hospital, and 8 weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to the emergency department of a second hospital because of progressive temporal headache with retro-orbital pain on the left side that had lasted for 3 days. The physical examination was reportedly normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 19). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. Computed tomography (CT) of the head was performed and reportedly showed mild periventricular white-matter disease with no acute intracranial abnormality. CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed no intracranial aneurysm, stenosis, or occlusion. The patient was discharged home.
The next morning, the patient awoke with double vision. The headache had resolved. She presented to a neuro-ophthalmology urgent care clinic associated with this hospital. The patient reported persistent pain in the left eye, which was worse with abduction, as well as photosensitivity and an episode of pain in the left side of the jaw in the preceding week. She had normal visual acuity, color vision, visual fields, and afferent visual function. The optic disks were normal, sharp, and flat. The left eye had esotropia and hypertropia, as well as a limitation in abduction. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 11 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level was 3.0 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). A presumptive diagnosis of acute left sixth cranial nerve palsy associated with cerebral microvascular disease was considered. Corrective treatment with eye patching was recommended, and the double vision resolved over the next 3 weeks.
Eight weeks after she had presented to the emergency department of the second hospital, the patient presented to the emergency department of a third hospital because similar symptoms had developed in her right eye. She reported having headache with retro-orbital pain on the right side over the past 3 days, accompanied by changes in her color vision and occasional floaters. The physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of 159/66 mm Hg and an abduction deficit of the right eye. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 17 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 30), and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was 1.64 mg per liter (reference value, <3.00). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. A screening test for Lyme disease antibodies was negative.
Dr. Jeremy N. Ford: Cross-sectional imaging of the head and orbits had been performed at the first hospital, and the results were reinterpreted at the third hospital. CT of the head (Figure 1A and 1B) reportedly showed stranding of the intraconal fat in the right orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography of the head, neck, and orbits (performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material) reportedly showed abnormal enhancement and edema of the optic nerve and surrounding tissue on the right side. On my directed review of the MRI (Figure 1C through 1F), I found that the mild edema and enhancement predominantly involved the optic-nerve sheath and intraconal fat, which confirmed the findings on CT of the head. The optic nerve itself was largely spared. The temporomandibular joints were partially visible, and there was mild periarticular edema and enhancement of the left joint. On T2-weighted imaging, scattered hyperintense foci were seen in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, a nonspecific finding most likely attributable to chronic small-vessel disease.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Walton: Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was transferred to the neurology unit of this hospital. On evaluation, she reported persistent double vision and pain on right lateral gaze but resolution of the retro-orbital headache. She also reported a recent mild flare of an erythematous, annular rash, as well as recent hair thinning and long-standing Raynaud’s phenomenon. Review of systems was negative for fever, night sweats, weight loss, joint erythema or swelling, muscle stiffness or pain, scalp or temple tenderness, jaw claudication, recurrent sinusitis, nasal crusting, epistaxis, cough, hoarseness, cough or shortness of breath, hemoptysis, dry mouth or dry eyes, oral ulcers, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, hearing changes, paresthesia, weakness in the arms and legs, or changes in the nails. There were no gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms.
The patient had a remote history of Graves’ disease with orbitopathy that had been diagnosed and treated more than two decades before this presentation. The medical history was also notable for hypothyroidism, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cholecystectomy, ovary-sparing hysterectomy, and lumpectomy for estrogen receptor–positive, progesterone receptor–positive breast cancer. A surveillance mammogram obtained in the previous month had reportedly been normal. She had received three vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Medications included atorvastatin, amlodipine, levothyroxine, and tamoxifen. A rash had occurred after the previous use of hydrochlorothiazide. She was married and lived in coastal Massachusetts. She drank wine rarely and did not use tobacco or other substances. Her family history was notable for a maternal aunt with thyroid disease and a child with vitiligo.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.1°C, the pulse 68 beats per minute, the blood pressure 173/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A few scattered erythematous macules were present on the abdomen, including a well-healed punch-biopsy site. A few telangiectasias were observed on the face. There was no rash on the face or scalp, and no sclerodactyly was observed. The hair was normal in pattern and distribution. There was no conjunctival injection. Extraocular movements were normal except for abduction of the right eye, which was limited and caused pain. There was no proptosis or lid lag. Visual acuity was 20/25 in the left eye and 20/40 with red color desaturation in the right eye. The right optic disk appeared pale as compared with the left optic disk. The remainder of the general and neurologic examination was normal.
An electrocardiogram was normal. The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, albumin, and globulin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 6 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level was 0.6 mg per liter. Screening tests for antibodies to hepatitis B virus core antigen, hepatitis C virus, histone, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative, as were tests for Lyme disease antibodies, syphilis antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and varicella–zoster virus IgM; varicella–zoster virus IgG was detected. A test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, an interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and serum and urine toxicology screens were also negative.
A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear, with an opening pressure of 14 cm of water. Gram’s staining of the CSF showed rare mononuclear cells and no organisms. The CSF glucose level was 86 mg per deciliter (4.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and the CSF protein level was 30 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were no nucleated cells present.
On the second day, testing for antibodies to bartonella was negative. The levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme, C3, and C4 were normal, as were the results of serum free light-chain testing, serum protein electrophoresis, and urinalysis. The IgG4 level was 137.3 mg per deciliter (reference range, 3.9 to 86.4); the levels of other IgG subclasses were normal. Testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies was negative, as was CSF testing for cryptococcal antigen and varicella–zoster virus IgM.
Dr. Ford: CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no lymphadenopathy; there was hepatic steatosis and a 2-mm right apical nodule. MRI of the head and whole spine, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed asymmetric enhancement surrounding the intraorbital and intracanalicular segments of the right optic-nerve sheath and intraconal fat. No abnormal spinal cord enhancement was observed. Ultrasonography of the temporal arteries showed no halo sign.
Dr. Walton: A diagnostic test was performed.",Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis.
Case 6-2024: A 21-Year-Old Man with Fatigue and Night Sweats,"Dr. Ben Ouyang (Medicine): A 21-year-old man was admitted to this hospital in the summer because of pancytopenia.
The patient had been in his usual state of good health until 4 weeks before the current presentation, when nausea and vomiting developed. The nausea and vomiting resolved after 1 day, but fatigue developed. Two weeks before the current presentation, lightheadedness associated with changing positions developed, as well as night sweats; fatigue persisted. On the morning of the current presentation, the patient had lightheadedness while lying down, and he presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.
At the other hospital, the patient reported ongoing lightheadedness. The temporal temperature was 37.2°C, the blood pressure 131/68 mm Hg, the pulse 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 91.2 kg, the height 192 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.7. The conjunctivae were pale. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia and an elevated blood bilirubin level. The blood lactate dehydrogenase level was greater than 2500 U per liter (reference range, 135 to 225). Blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, d-dimer, and fibrinogen were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.

Chest radiography reportedly showed no abnormalities. Intravenous fluids were administered, and the pulse decreased to 100 beats per minute. Oral doxycycline was administered for possible tickborne illness. One unit of packed red cells was transfused, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported that the lightheadedness had abated. He had no history of fever, hematuria, blood in the stool, or bleeding from other sites. He worked as a carpenter and spent minimal time outside. He lived with his parents and brother and had two cats and a dog. He took no medications. There were no known drug allergies. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His maternal grandmother had had lymphoma.
The temporal temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 131/64 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The results of pulmonary, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were normal. Areas of hypopigmentation of the skin were detected near the elbows, fingers, and feet. Cranial nerve function was intact, and strength was 5 out of 5 in the arms and legs.
Dr. Maria Y. Chen: Examination of a peripheral-blood smear (Figure 1) revealed evidence of macrocytic anemia with anisopoikilocytosis. Few white cells were present. There were neutrophils with variable segmentation and occasional immature forms, as well as platelets that were normal in terms of number and morphologic features.

Peripheral-Blood Smear.
Dr. Ouyang: A direct antiglobulin test was negative for IgG; C3 was detected on microscopic examination. Screening tests for Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA were negative. Urinalysis showed 2+ urobilinogen (reference value, negative), without bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, protein, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Madeleine M. Sertic: A sagittal ultrasound image of the abdomen (Figure 2) showed mild splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 15.8 cm on the long axis (reference value with adjustment for sex and height, <14.1). There was an incidental rounded echogenic lesion in the left hepatic lobe that measured up to 1.3 cm in diameter, a finding consistent with a hepatic hemangioma.

Case 5-2024: A 36-Year-Old Man with Fevers,"Dr. Ethan Borre (Medicine): A 36-year-old man was evaluated in the infectious diseases clinic of this hospital because of fevers.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 18 days before the current presentation, when he began to have a sensation of swelling in his throat. Three days later, the temporal temperature measured at home was 38.4°C. A home test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen was negative. The patient was evaluated in a local urgent care clinic, where he was told that there were white spots on his tonsils. Treatment with amoxicillin–clavulanic acid was started for a presumptive diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. A throat culture was reportedly negative, but treatment with amoxicillin–clavulanic acid was continued. During the next 4 days, fevers persisted. A repeat home test for SARS-CoV-2 antigen was negative. Eleven days before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician.
In addition to fevers, the patient reported headaches. Two weeks before the onset of symptoms, he had traveled with his wife to the southwestern United States for 1 week. During the trip, his wife had begun to have fever and sore throat; her symptoms had resolved after several days, and she did not seek medical evaluation. The patient reported that he did not have throat pain, but rather that the lower part of his neck felt swollen and that moving his neck caused discomfort. He had no dysphagia, odynophagia, rhinorrhea, or rash. His medical history included seasonal allergies.
Two years earlier, a routine screening test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had been negative. In addition to amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, medications included ibuprofen as needed for headaches and acetaminophen as needed for fevers. The patient had no known drug allergies. He lived in Massachusetts and worked in an office setting. He had moved to the United States from Asia 7 years before the current presentation. He drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. He occasionally smoked tobacco. His father had hypertension, and his paternal grandmother had cancer of unclear primary origin.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 127/69 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The tonsils appeared normal, without exudates or enlargement. There was mild tenderness on palpation over the anterior portion of the neck that was thought to correspond to enlarged lymph nodes in the anterior cervical region. The remainder of the examination was normal.
A complete blood count with differential count and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was 65.8 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) antibodies was negative. Urinalysis was normal. A specimen of blood was obtained for culture. The results of chest radiography were normal. A diagnosis of viral pharyngitis was considered, but treatment with amoxicillin–clavulanic acid for possible streptococcal pharyngitis was continued.

During the next 6 days, daily fevers and headaches continued, and fatigue developed. The patient reported his symptoms during a telephone call with his primary care physician. Blood cultures that had been obtained during the previous evaluation were without growth, and additional testing was performed. The blood level of CRP was 138.9 mg per liter, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 81 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 14). A test for Lyme disease was nonreactive. The result of an interferon-γ release assay to detect previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis was invalid because of a test control failure. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Shambo Guha Roy: Computed tomography (CT) of the neck (Figure 1), chest, and abdomen was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. A calcified lung nodule that was observed in the left lower lobe was consistent with previous granulomatous disease, and mild degenerative changes were noted in the thoracic spine. Evaluation of the thyroid gland was suboptimal owing to a streak artifact from the arms; however, a possible hypoattenuating nodule was observed in the right lobe.
FIGURE 1

CT of the Neck.
Dr. Borre: During the next 4 days, fevers continued, and the patient was referred to the infectious diseases clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.
In the infectious diseases clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient reported that fevers were most prominent in the evening; the highest recorded temperature was 39.5°C. He had had two episodes of chills associated with fever, as well as occasional night sweats. He had no pets or animal exposures. He did not consume unpasteurized cheeses or uncooked meats. He was sexually active with his wife. A dental extraction had been performed 2 months before the onset of fevers. He had no known exposures to persons with tuberculosis.
The temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 144/98 mm Hg, the pulse 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was noted to cough occasionally during the examination but was breathing comfortably with normal lung sounds. The oropharynx appeared normal, without tonsillar exudates. There was no supraclavicular, submandibular, cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Firm, nontender thyroid tissue was palpable in the anterior portion of the neck. No rashes or skin lesions were present, including on the palms or soles. The heart was tachycardic with a regular rhythm and no murmurs. There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Subacute thyroiditis.
Case 4-2024: A 39-Year-Old Man with Fever and Headache after International Travel,"Dr. Hayden S. Andrews (Medicine): A 39-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital during the summer because of fever with shaking chills, diffuse headache, and fatigue, which had lasted for the 4 days since he had returned from a trip to East Africa.
During the patient’s 2-week trip, he had been on a safari in Tanzania but had not had any contact with animals. He reported that he had received mosquito bites, especially during the first days of the trip. He had eaten cooked shrimp and lobster and a small amount of raw tuna. On the second-to-last day of the trip, nausea, vomiting, and nonbloody diarrhea developed. On the last day of the trip, the patient had fatigue and slept for much of the day; however, he felt well enough to travel home the next day.
On the night the patient returned home to Massachusetts, he began to have fever with a temperature of 38.3°C, along with shaking chills, diffuse headache, and lower back pain. The following day, he presented to an urgent care facility because of fever, malaise, and headache. The oral temperature was 38.5°C; the remainder of the examination was normal. Nucleic acid testing was negative for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Oral prednisone was prescribed for the treatment of headache. On the third day home, in the evening, the patient had fever with a temperature of 39.5°C and lower back pain. The next morning, 4 days after returning from the trip, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported recurrent fevers accompanied by blurry vision, which had occurred despite the use of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and prednisone. He reported ongoing weakness and anorexia, noting that he was consuming mostly fruits and electrolyte-replacement solutions. He had had nausea with diarrhea but without vomiting. The patient noted that his urine output had decreased and that the urine appeared darker than usual. Review of systems was negative for myalgias, rash, neck stiffness, photophobia, respiratory symptoms, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, and joint pain. His travel companion reported no symptoms. The patient reported no known tick exposures before or during travel in Tanzania.
The patient’s medical history was notable for degenerative knee disease with a meniscus tear, for which he had received glucocorticoid injections. There were no known adverse drug reactions. He had received a series of three vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2. He lived with his partner in a suburb of Boston. He had been a competitive athlete and was employed in the energy industry. He drank beer occasionally and did not use tobacco or other substances.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 38.9°C, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113/62 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 104.3 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 30.3. Facial flushing and mild scleral icterus were present. The urine was dark brown. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.
The blood levels of calcium, creatine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An extended respiratory viral panel and a screening test for Lyme disease IgM and IgG antibodies were negative. Urinalysis showed 3+ blood, and microscopic examination of the urinary sediment showed 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2). Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed nonspecific minor T-wave inversions.

Dr. Marc D. Succi: A single-view frontal image from portable chest radiography (Figure 1A) showed clear lungs without evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion. The heart size was normal, and there was no radiographic evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The bones were normal. A limited abdominal ultrasound image (Figure 1B), obtained to evaluate the liver and biliary system only, showed mild hepatic steatosis but was otherwise unremarkable.

Dr. Andrews: Lactated Ringer’s solution and magnesium sulfate were administered intravenously, and acetaminophen and ibuprofen were administered orally. The patient was admitted to the hospital.
Diagnostic and management decisions were made.",Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
Case 3-2024: An 8-Week-Old Male Infant with Inconsolable Crying and Weakness,"Dr. Jeffrey M. Sumner (Pediatrics): An 8-week-old male infant was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital because of inconsolable crying, lethargy, weakness, and hypoxemia.
The patient had been well until 7 days before the current presentation, when irritability and frequent crying developed. One day before the current presentation, the episodes of crying increased in duration, and the patient’s grandmother noticed that he cried more intensely when the right side of his abdomen was touched. The patient was evaluated at the pediatric primary care clinic of another hospital. The vital signs and physical examination were reportedly normal, and a diagnosis of discomfort due to gastrointestinal gas was considered.
After the patient returned home, he had a crying episode that lasted for multiple hours while he was awake; the crying stopped while he was fully asleep. After he woke up, the crying continued for 8 hours and became weaker. During breast-feeding, the patient fed less vigorously than usual, and the latch onto the nipple was weaker. That night, the crying continued, and the patient became inconsolable. He had frantic movements of the arms and legs and slept only 1 hour. On the day of the current presentation, the inconsolable crying continued. The patient did not latch onto the nipple, and his mother expressed breast milk directly into his mouth. A family member called the pediatric primary care clinic and was instructed to bring the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, additional history was obtained from the patient’s family members. There had been no change in the frequency of wet diapers; the last bowel movement had occurred 2 days before this presentation. The patient had been born at a gestational age of 39 weeks 1 day by a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery after a normal pregnancy. The birth weight had been 4.5 kg (98th percentile), the length 54.6 cm (99th percentile), and the head circumference 36.5 cm (94th percentile). The patient had met normal developmental milestones. He had not yet received the routine immunizations recommended for 2-month-old infants. Medications included vitamin D supplements; there were no known medication allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with his grandmother, who primarily cared for him, as well as his mother, father, and sister. His mother had depression, anxiety, and anemia. His father and sister were healthy.
On examination, the axillary temperature was 37.2°C, the blood pressure 100/76 mm Hg, the heart rate 153 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 7.1 kg (99th percentile), the height 62.5 cm (>99th percentile), and the head circumference 41.5 cm (99th percentile). The patient was alert but irritable. He cried weakly and could not be soothed. The anterior fontanelle was open, soft, and flat. The mucous membranes were moist. The heart rate was tachycardic and regular. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft, with no hepatosplenomegaly. The results of the testicular examination were normal. There was no rash.
The blood levels of glucose, lactic acid, lipase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 621,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000); the remainder of the complete blood count and differential count was normal. The results of urinalysis and urine toxicology screening were normal. Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza A and B viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for culture. Radiography of the chest and abdomen and ultrasonography of the abdomen showed no abnormalities.

While the patient was in the emergency department, he remained irritable and did not attain a calm awake state. He was admitted to this hospital. Four hours after presentation, lethargy developed. Additional testing was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture was performed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The CSF glucose level was 54 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and the CSF protein level was 104 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55); there were 1055 red cells per microliter and 2 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 70% were lymphocytes. A diagnosis of meningitis was considered. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir was started.
Six hours after presentation, increased work of breathing developed, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 100%. The patient was transferred to the PICU.
Dr. Sarah A. Murphy: On arrival at the PICU, the patient was difficult to arouse. He had grunting respirations, head-bobbing, intercostal retractions, and an exaggerated abdominal breathing pattern. With vigorous stimulation, the patient had a weak hypophonic cry, gurgling, and stertor on inspiration. Ptosis was present in both eyes. When the eyes were opened by the examiner, the pupils were equal, round, and reactive. The face appeared symmetric and placid. There were few spontaneous movements of the arms, and the patient did not move his arms against gravity. There was no spontaneous movement of the legs, and diffuse hypotonia was present. Muscle bulk was normal and symmetric. Reflexes were decreased but preserved.
Tracheal intubation was performed, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Tachycardia and hypertension persisted despite the administration of boluses of sedative and analgesic agents and the initiation of continuous infusions of opioids and benzodiazepines.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Infant botulism.
Case 2-2024: A 57-Year-Old Woman with Melanoma and Fever,"Dr. Matthew L. Meizlish (Medicine): A 57-year-old woman with resected stage IIIC cutaneous melanoma was admitted to this hospital because of fever.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 months before the current admission, when bleeding developed from a lesion on the right side of the scalp. After evaluation by her primary care physician, she was referred to a surgical clinic at another hospital; examination of a skin-biopsy specimen revealed ulcerated melanoma with positive margins. The patient was referred to the oncology clinic of this hospital.
Three months before the current admission, a wide local excision of the scalp lesion and a neck lymph-node dissection were performed; examination of the specimens revealed metastatic melanoma in 2 of 26 lymph nodes. A diagnosis of stage IIIC melanoma was made. Molecular profiling identified the BRAF V600E mutation, and treatment with adjuvant therapy was planned to begin after the patient had recovered fully from surgery.
One month before the current admission, the patient was evaluated in the oncology clinic for initiation of treatment with a combination of dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (a MEK inhibitor) as targeted therapy for melanoma. She felt well, and the surgical wound had healed. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was started.

One day after the initiation of treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib, fever and nausea developed. Dabrafenib and trametinib therapy was temporarily discontinued, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was started. Fever and nausea resolved after 1 day, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was stopped. Once the patient had 1 day without recurrent fever after the antipyretic medications had been stopped, treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was resumed.
Two weeks before the current admission, fever recurred. The patient was evaluated at the other hospital. The blood levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of kidney function. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again stopped, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was started. Fever and nausea resolved after 1 day, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was stopped. Once the patient had 1 day without recurrent fever after the antipyretic medications had been stopped, treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again resumed.
Four days before the current admission, fever recurred. The patient was again evaluated at the other hospital. Results of liver tests and kidney-function tests were again normal, as was the complete blood count. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again stopped, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was initiated. Daily fevers persisted for 4 days, and the patient was advised to present to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
On evaluation, the patient reported fatigue that had started 1 month earlier and had gradually increased in severity, as well as light-headedness when standing from a seated position. She also reported intermittent vomiting, loose stools, and pain in the right upper quadrant that increased after eating but no diarrhea or dysuria. She had a dry cough without shortness of breath.
Other medical history included carpal tunnel syndrome that had been treated with carpal tunnel release surgery. The patient had no known drug allergies. She worked as a nurse and lived with her husband and two adult children in a coastal region of New England. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit drugs. Her father had hyperthyroidism; her mother had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease.
The temporal temperature was 40.2°C, the blood pressure 85/53 mm Hg, the pulse 108 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was diaphoretic and appeared ill. The mucous membranes were moist, and no lesions were present in the oropharynx. The heart sounds were regular, with no murmurs, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. There was mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No rash was present.
The white-cell count was 5190 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); 20% of the cells were bands (reference range, 0 to 10), and 10% were metamyelocytes (reference value, 0). The platelet count was 87,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The blood level of creatinine was 2.73 mg per deciliter (241 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]), AST 190 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32), ALT 62 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and alkaline phosphatase 173 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). Tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for adenovirus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were negative. A blood specimen was obtained for culture. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Jiyoon Kang: Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant (Figure 1A and 1B) revealed cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis or biliary ductal dilatation. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1C through 1F), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed findings suggestive of hepatic steatosis, pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions, subsegmental linear atelectasis, and bilateral lung nodules that were similar in appearance to those seen on staging CT performed 1 month earlier.

Case 1-2024: A 25-Year-Old Pregnant Woman with Bleeding after a Snakebite,"Dr. Hamdja Moustafa: A 25-year-old pregnant woman presented to the emergency department of the Poli District Hospital in the North Region of Cameroon because of vaginal bleeding after a snakebite.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 hour before this presentation, when she was bitten by a snake while walking with her family. On presentation to the emergency department, she reported fatigue, dizziness, abdominal pain, and pain and numbness in her left lower leg. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 (on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating greater alteration of consciousness). On examination, the heart rate was 134 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute while the patient was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was notable for mild conjunctival pallor and swelling in the inferior left lower leg, which had been tied with a tourniquet. The leg was tender with ecchymosis, and two fang marks were visible on the left foot (Figure 1). The patient had diffuse pain in the lower abdomen, intermittent contractions, and vaginal bleeding. Fetal movement was detected on palpation. The fetal heart rate was 112 beats per minute; ultrasonography was not available. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.

Case 40-2023: A 70-Year-Old Woman with Cough and Shortness of Breath,"Dr. Alison C. Castle: A 70-year-old woman with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was evaluated in a clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, because of cough, shortness of breath, and malaise.
Fifteen years before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of HIV infection after she had presented with substantial weight loss and fatigue. The initial CD4 cell count obtained at the time of diagnosis was 29 cells per microliter (reference range, 332 to 1642). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) with stavudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz was started. During the subsequent year, the symptoms resolved, the HIV RNA level became undetectable, and the patient reported adherence to her medications. Ten years before the current presentation, additional ART became accessible within South Africa, and the ART regimen was changed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz.
Five years before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to a local hospital because of diarrhea and diffuse myalgias, and she was found to have virologic failure. The ART regimen was changed to zidovudine, lamivudine, and lopinavir–ritonavir. During the subsequent 4 years, the patient reported adherence to these medications without a lapse in treatment. The HIV RNA level ranged from 68 to 594,000 copies per milliliter of plasma (reference value, undetectable).
Twelve months before the current presentation, the patient had new shortness of breath, cough, anorexia, and weight loss. During the subsequent 4 weeks, the symptoms progressively increased in severity. When the shortness of breath worsened to the extent that she was unable to walk, she sought evaluation at the clinic. The temporal temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 104/64 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 16.9. On examination, the patient appeared ill but was able to speak in full sentences. Auscultation of the chest was limited because of frequent coughing; diffuse crackles were present in both lungs.
Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear of the sputum was positive for mycobacteria, and subsequent nucleic acid testing and culture of the sputum was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. In accordance with recommendations from the South African Department of Health, the patient was instructed to isolate at home and complete a course of treatment for tuberculosis, which included rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.

During the subsequent 6 months, the patient took the antimycobacterial medications, and the shortness of breath and cough decreased but still persisted. Her weight decreased by 8 kg, even though the anorexia had resolved. Four months before the current presentation, new headaches and mouth ulcers developed, and the patient sought evaluation at the clinic. A sputum specimen was obtained for examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear and mycobacterial nucleic acid testing and culture, all of which were negative. The HIV RNA level was 151,000 copies per milliliter of plasma. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment.
Twelve days before the current presentation, the patient presented to the clinic for follow-up, and the ART regimen was changed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. When the symptoms did not abate, the patient presented to the clinic for additional evaluation. She described persistent shortness of breath and dry cough, as well as headaches on the right side and mouth ulcers. The review of systems was notable for fatigue and weakness during the past 12 months, as well as fever, night sweats, chest pain, mouth ulcers, and odynophagia. She had no ageusia, anosmia, vision changes, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, or joint pain. Radiography of the chest had not been performed.
The patient had not received vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). She took tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolutegravir, as well as acetaminophen for muscle pain as needed. There were no known drug allergies. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs; she did not take any remedies from traditional healers. The patient lived with her daughter in a rural farming community in a coastal region of South Africa, and she had not traveled recently. She commuted by foot within her community and had regular exposure to cattle, goats, chickens, and dogs. Her household water supply originated from a borehole and was untreated.
On examination, the patient was alert but appeared ill and cachectic. She coughed throughout the interview. The blood pressure was 97/71 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. The body-mass index was 13.7. The mucous membranes were dry. She had thrush on the tongue, as well as superficial ulcers on the buccal mucosa. On auscultation of the chest, diffuse crackles were present in both lungs and were worst in the right lower lobe. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
A diagnostic test was performed.","Advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection, persistent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and rhinocerebral aspergillus superinfection."
"Case 39-2023: A 43-Year-Old Woman with Chronic Diarrhea, Hair Loss, and Nail and Skin Changes","Dr. W.K. Claudia Wu: A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital of the Chinese University of Hong Kong because of abdominal pain and diarrhea.
The patient had been well until 6 months before this admission, when colicky, diffuse abdominal pain developed. She also had nonbloody diarrhea that occurred up to 10 times daily. During the subsequent 6 months, the patient noticed decreased appetite and weight loss of 5 kg. The symptoms did not abate, and her family encouraged her to seek medical evaluation.
On evaluation, the patient reported gradually darkening skin on the face, arms, and legs, as well as hair thinning and changes in the appearance of all the fingernails and toenails during the previous 4 months. There was no nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, hematochezia, fevers, or night sweats.
The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Ten months before this admission, she had sought evaluation by a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner because of irregular menses. She was given a “homemade” traditional Chinese medicine that contained unknown ingredients. The patient took the remedy for 4 months and stopped taking it when the abdominal pain and diarrhea developed 6 months before this admission. She did not take other medications and had no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband and son in an urban area of Hong Kong, and she did not work outside the home. She did not vape or smoke cigarettes, and she did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother and father were healthy; there was no family history of gastroenterologic, autoimmune, or hereditary diseases.
On evaluation, the temporal temperature was 37.2°C, the blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg, and the heart rate 85 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20. Examinations of the thyroid, heart, and lungs were normal. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Moderate pitting edema was observed in the lower legs, up to the mid-calf.
Dr. W.S. Agnes Chan: On dermatologic examination, the patient had patchy hair loss, with a large patch of alopecia at the vertex of the scalp; there was no scarring of the scalp (Figure 1A). A hair-pull test (in which 40 to 60 strands of closely grouped hair are gently pulled, with more than 10% of hairs pulled out indicating a positive result) was negative. There were symmetric brown macules over the lateral lower cheeks and malar regions of the face (Figure 1B and 1C), and hyperpigmentation and diffuse brown-gray macules were observed over the palms and the palmar aspects of the fingers (Figure 1D and 1E). Onychodystrophy was present on all the fingernails (Figure 1E) and toenails. There was onycholysis with distal separation of the nail plates from the nail beds, thinned nail plates, distal nail-plate crumbling, and onychomadesis with proximal separation of the nail plates from the nail matrices (Figure 1E and 1F).

Case 38-2023: A 68-Year-Old Woman with Abnormal Movements and Confusion,"Dr. D. Curtis Wegener (Neurology): A 68-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of worsening confusion and abnormal movements of the face, arms, and legs.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 9 weeks before the current presentation, when she presented to another hospital because of intermittent slurred speech and dizziness that had lasted for 1 day. The score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was obtained; the NIHSS is an 11-component tool that assesses the severity of stroke, with scores ranging from 0 to 42 and higher scores indicating more severe neurologic deficits. Her NIHSS score was 1 owing to the presence of mild-to-moderate dysarthria, and she was not considered to be a candidate for treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. Imaging studies were obtained.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed a punctate focus of restricted diffusion associated with mild signal hyperintensity involving the deep white matter of the left frontal lobe on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. This finding was consistent with an acute ischemic infarct without hemorrhage or mass effect. There were also findings that had been observed on previous imaging, including foci of encephalomalacia in the right inferior frontal lobe and left occipital lobe that were related to previous trauma, a punctate old lacunar infarct in the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere, and superimposed patchy foci of T2-weighted and FLAIR white-matter hyperintensity most consistent with small-vessel disease. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed no intracranial or cervical occlusion, high-grade stenosis, or aneurysm. The patient was admitted to the hospital.
The patient had been taking apixaban daily because of a history of two deep venous thromboses, and the treatment was continued. She had also been taking atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and the dose was increased. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no patent foramen ovale. Continuous telemetric monitoring showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation. Mobile cardiac telemetry was planned for the 30-day period after discharge.
On the second hospital day, frequent irregular movements of the right leg developed, occurring every few seconds in a nonrhythmic pattern. The next day, similar movements of the right arm developed. The patient described the movements as involuntary and reported no uncontrollable urges or compulsions to move the arm or leg. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was reportedly negative for any new findings. Electroencephalography (EEG) was reportedly normal in the waking, drowsy, and light-sleep states. The dysarthria resolved, but the involuntary movements persisted. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day.
During the next 6 weeks, involuntary movements involving the arms, legs, and tongue occurred with increasing frequency. The patient began using a walker. Nine days before the current presentation, the patient was again admitted to the other hospital after multiple falls at home, which she attributed to uncontrolled movements of her arms and legs. On examination, she had nearly constant writhing, nonrhythmic, dancelike movements of the arms, legs, and trunk, as well as rolling movements of the tongue. She could stand up from a chair while holding onto a walker. Scattered bruises were present on the lower legs. Imaging studies were obtained.
CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed mild scattered parenchymal hypodensities without hemorrhage or evidence of an acute infarct. A presumptive diagnosis of vascular chorea was made, and the patient was treated with oral levetiracetam. On the third hospital day, MRI of the head was attempted but was limited by motion artifacts due to involuntary movements. There were small foci of restricted diffusion in the right frontal and parietal periventricular white matter within the right corona radiata and centrum semiovale, findings consistent with new small acute-to-subacute infarcts without hemorrhage or mass effect.
On the fourth hospital day, the dose of levetiracetam was increased. EEG reportedly showed excessive irregular background slow-wave activity without focal, lateralizing, or epileptiform features; there were no findings that correlated to the movements of the head and body. On the fifth hospital day, the irregular movements had not abated, and treatment with levetiracetam was stopped. Treatment with low-dose clonazepam at bedtime was started to help with sleep. On the sixth hospital day, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.
Three days after discharge, a family member observed that the patient was confused and unable to maintain a conversation. The family member brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient was not able to provide additional information. Other medical history, obtained from the family member, included hypothyroidism, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, pulmonary hypertension, and vitiligo.
Medications included ambrisentan, apixaban, atorvastatin, cholecalciferol, glipizide, levothyroxine, metformin, omeprazole, and sitagliptin. Clonazepam had not been administered at the rehabilitation facility. The patient had taken warfarin for many years for her history of two deep venous thromboses; 10 months before the current presentation, treatment had been switched from warfarin to apixaban. Acetylsalicylic acid had caused hives; there were no other known allergies. Before being discharged to the rehabilitation facility, the patient had lived alone in a suburban area and had worked in a school. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol rarely. Her father and brother had diabetes mellitus; there was no family history of abnormal movements or stroke.
The temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, the pulse 79 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.6. The patient was sleepy but arousable with verbal stimuli. She was oriented to self but not to time or place. She could follow simple commands with repeated instructions but could not follow complex commands. She had irregular spontaneous movements of the face, mouth, and tongue; she also had irregular spontaneous writhing movements of the arms and legs that were partially suppressible. When she was asked to hold her arms outstretched with the palms facing upward while keeping her eyes closed, her right arm drifted downward, and the palm pronated toward the floor. Strength was 4 out of 5 on right shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, elbow extension, wrist flexion, and wrist extension; the remainder of the examination was normal.
Blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Urinalysis showed trace ketones and 1+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative); the urine sediment showed 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 44 mm per hour (reference range for women in the patient’s age group, 0 to 40). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Hillary R. Kelly: CT of the head performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, as well as CT angiography of the head and neck performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no evidence of an acute territorial infarct and no change in the long-term findings, including the previously described areas of encephalomalacia and periventricular white-matter hypodensity.
MRI of the head (Figure 1), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed multiple foci of restricted diffusion associated with T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperintensity, findings consistent with acute-to-early subacute infarcts. Foci were scattered throughout the cortex and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. The most prominent foci were located along the left temporo-occipital junction. Numerous foci involved the cortex of the frontal and parietal lobes along the precentral and postcentral gyri. There was a small punctate focus of restricted diffusion associated with T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperintensity in the right superior cerebellar hemisphere, a finding consistent with an additional small infarct. There was no associated hemorrhage or mass effect. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no intracranial occlusion, high-grade stenosis, or aneurysm.

Case 37-2023: A 29-Year-Old Man with Sickle Cell Disease and Right Hip Pain,"Dr. Ya Haddy Sallah (Medicine): A 29-year-old man with sickle cell disease was admitted to this hospital because of pain in the right hip.
The patient had received a diagnosis of sickle cell disease in childhood. The sickle cell disease had been complicated by vaso-occlusive events with pain severe enough to lead to hospitalization 3 or 4 times per year. He also had a history of osteonecrosis of the hips that had led to treatment with total hip arthroplasty of both hips 3 years before the current presentation.
Seven days before the current presentation, the patient presented to this hospital with pain in the low back, hips, and legs, which had developed 1 day after he had carried boxes up several flights of stairs. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. He was admitted to the hospital, and imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. F. Joseph Simeone: Posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the chest (Figure 1A) showed normal lungs and a normal cardiac silhouette; superior and inferior end-plate depressions in midthoracic vertebral bodies were noted. Frontal and lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine (Figure 1B) showed superior and inferior end-plate depressions at multiple vertebral levels and diffuse bony sclerosis, findings consistent with bony changes from sickle cell disease. An anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis (Figure 1C) showed evidence of total hip arthroplasty; the findings had not changed from those observed on recently obtained radiographs.

Dr. Sallah: A diagnosis of a painful vaso-occlusive event was made, and treatment included intravenous fluids, ketorolac, and hydromorphone. Musculoskeletal strain was considered to be a contributing factor for the pain, given the recent strenuous activity. The pain slowly abated, and on hospital day 5, the patient was discharged home.
One day after discharge, and 2 days before the current presentation, pain in the right hip developed while the patient was at rest. Despite treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen, the hip pain worsened, and the patient was unable to walk. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported pain in the right hip that felt different in quality from the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. He also reported pleuritic chest pain that felt similar in quality to the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. The tympanic temperature measured at home was 37.8°C.
During the 6 months before the current presentation, vaso-occlusive events had increased in frequency and severity. There had been three hospital admissions with a duration of 4 to 8 days, including one admission for acute chest syndrome. The pain associated with vaso-occlusive events typically involved the chest, arms, or thighs. There was a history of automated red-cell exchange, which had been performed before total hip arthroplasty; there was also a history of four blood transfusions. Other history included tinnitus, symmetric high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, and cholelithiasis. Medications included voxelotor and folic acid, as well as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and hydromorphone as needed for pain. The patient had no known allergies. He lived in a suburb of Boston and worked as an engineer. He had traveled to West Africa 1 year before the current presentation and to South Asia 3 weeks before the current presentation. He drank alcohol occasionally, had never smoked tobacco, and did not use illicit drugs. Both of his parents and his brother had sickle cell trait.
The temporal temperature was 35.7°C, the blood pressure 121/56 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. He had mild tenderness on palpation of the right hip but no obvious deformity; there was a well-healed incision without overlying erythema. He was able to fully extend and flex the right hip, but such movement caused mild discomfort. There was moderate discomfort with the log-roll test (rolling the thigh internally and externally with the patient in the supine position). The remainder of the examination was normal.
The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 15,680 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the hemoglobin level 7.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the platelet count 581,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The blood C-reactive protein level was 100.6 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 113 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 14). Nucleic acid amplification testing for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Simeone: Findings on radiographs of the chest, hips, and pelvis were unchanged from those observed 7 days earlier.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Campylobacter fetus bacteremia and osteomyelitis.
Case 36-2023: A 19-Year-Old Man with Diabetes and Kidney Cysts,"Dr. Weizhen Tan: A 19-year-old man was evaluated in the nephrology clinic of this hospital because of kidney cysts.
The patient had been well until 3 years before the current presentation, when diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and increased urinary frequency developed. The patient’s mother brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported that he woke up 3 or 4 times each night to urinate. He also had weight loss, decreased appetite, and increased thirst. The temporal temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 123/70 mm Hg, and the heart rate 65 beats per minute. The weight was 51.3 kg, the height 165 cm, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 18.8. The patient had dry skin; the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood glucose level was 780 mg per deciliter (43.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]), and the glycated hemoglobin level was 12.9% (reference range, 4.3 to 5.6). The blood creatinine level was 1.45 mg per deciliter (128 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was made. Insulin and intravenous fluids were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.

During the subsequent 3 days, treatment with a basal–bolus insulin regimen was established. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia resolved. On the fourth hospital day, the morning fasting blood glucose level was 162 mg per deciliter (9.0 mmol per liter), and the creatinine level was 1.33 mg per deciliter (118 μmol per liter). The patient was discharged home with instructions to continue treatment with insulin, and follow-up was arranged in the endocrinology clinic of another hospital.
During the subsequent 2 years, the patient continued treatment with insulin. Tests for glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), islet antigen 2 (IA-2), and insulin autoantibodies were negative. One year before the current presentation, the patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) obtained by his primary care provider as part of an annual physical examination.
In the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported no symptoms, and the examination was normal. The blood AST level was 87 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), the ALT level 158 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the ALP level 468 U per liter (reference range, 55 to 149), and the γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level 1158 U per liter (reference range, 8 to 61). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Samantha G. Harrington: Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant (Figure 1A) showed a normal-appearing gallbladder and common bile duct. The right kidney was partially visualized and had two cysts, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter; the left kidney was not seen. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (Figure 1B and 1C) showed a normal-appearing liver, biliary system, and spleen. The pancreatic head and neck were smaller than expected, and the body and tail of the pancreas were absent. There were multiple bilateral simple kidney cysts, ranging in size from 2 to 18 mm.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Tan: After these imaging studies were obtained, the patient did not return for scheduled follow-up in the gastroenterology clinic. One year later, and 1 week before the current presentation, the patient returned for follow-up. He had no symptoms, and the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The MRCP findings were unchanged from the previous evaluation. The patient was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospital for evaluation of his kidney cysts.
In the nephrology clinic, the patient reported that he felt well. He had had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccinations. Medications included insulin degludec and insulin lispro. There were no known drug allergies. He was a senior in high school and worked part-time at a restaurant. He lived in an apartment in a suburban area of New England with his mother and three siblings. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had prediabetes, obesity, and hypertension; his mother and three siblings were healthy. His paternal grandfather, maternal grandfather, and maternal great-grandfather had diabetes.
The blood pressure was 124/66 mm Hg and the heart rate 76 beats per minute. The weight was 65.5 kg, the height 176 cm, and the BMI 21.2. The examination was normal. Analysis of a freshly voided urine specimen revealed 1+ proteinuria, 2+ glucosuria, and trace ketonuria. Microscopic examination showed one mixed granular cast per low-power field and scattered squamous epithelial cells. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Harrington: Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder showed increased renal parenchymal echogenicity and loss of corticomedullary differentiation in both kidneys. The kidney cysts that had been seen previously were present.
Dr. Tan: A diagnostic test was performed.",HNF1B-related disease consistent with renal cysts and diabetes spectrum disorder.
Case 35-2023: A 38-Year-Old Woman with Waxing and Waning Pulmonary Nodules,"Dr. Zachary A. Sporn (Medicine): A 38-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of dyspnea, chest discomfort, and nodules on chest imaging.
Three years before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by an orthopedist for pain in the hips and lower back, and glucocorticoid injections were administered. Twenty-two months before the current admission, the patient presented to her primary care physician because of diarrhea; 4 months later, she was evaluated by her primary care physician for bloody diarrhea. Testing of a stool specimen for giardia antigen, cryptosporidium antigen, and Clostridioides difficile toxin was negative. The blood level of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase IgA was undetectable, and the level of IgA was normal. A stool culture grew Bacillus cereus. The patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist; colonoscopy reportedly revealed markedly erythematous mucosa in the rectum, ending 10 cm proximal to the anus, with granularity and loss of vascularity. A biopsy specimen obtained during the colonoscopy reportedly showed evidence of diffuse active chronic colitis. Treatment with mesalamine was started, but her symptoms did not abate; the treatment was stopped after 4 months.
During the next several months, the patient noticed progressive dyspnea and fatigue with exercise. Eight months before the current admission, she reported diffuse body and joint aches, especially of the lower back and hips, which prevented her from being able to run. Seven months before the current admission, she reported erythema, swelling, and pruritus in the right eye.
Three months before the current admission, there was a recurrence of bloody diarrhea, and colonoscopy was repeated. Examination reportedly revealed perianal skin tags; congested and erythematous mucosa in the rectum, which was biopsied; and two 5-mm colonic polyps, which were excised.
Dr. T. Leif Helland: Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimens obtained during colonoscopy reportedly revealed a tubular adenoma and a sessile serrated polyp, as well as moderately active chronic colitis. Treatment with mesalamine was resumed.
Dr. Sporn: The next month, while doing heavy housework, the patient had new dyspnea and bilateral pleuritic chest-wall pain that was greater on the left side than on the right side, and she had to stop doing housework. The pain persisted for several days, the dyspnea worsened, and the patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital. On evaluation, she had diminished breath sounds and a normal electrocardiogram. Laboratory test results were notable for a normal N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level and normal white-cell and differential counts. The troponin I level was undetectable, and the D-dimer level was 3150 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500). A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Blood cultures were obtained.
Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Chest radiography reportedly revealed bilateral focal, patchy airspace opacities (Figure 1A). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly ruled out pulmonary embolism but showed multifocal pulmonary nodules that measured up to 18 mm in diameter (Figure 1B), pleural effusions, and a kidney stone in the left kidney.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies of the Chest.
Dr. Sporn: A 5-day course of doxycycline, azithromycin, and prednisone was prescribed. Thirteen days later, approximately 2 months before the current admission, the patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospital because of continued dyspnea on exertion. The blood cultures that had been obtained during the previous visit to the emergency department were reportedly negative. White-cell and differential counts were normal, and the procalcitonin level was undetectable.
Dr. Shepard: Repeat chest radiography reportedly revealed persistent consolidations and increased pleural effusion.
Dr. Sporn: An additional 5-day course of prednisone and as-needed inhaled albuterol were prescribed. Four weeks later (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission), the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the other hospital. The patient reported pleuritic pain on the right side of the chest; her symptoms and imaging findings were thought to be related to multifocal pneumonia and parapneumonic effusions. A 3-week tapering course of prednisone was prescribed.
After completion of the prednisone course, the patient reported dyspnea with labored breathing, orthopnea, and chest discomfort. Repeat chest CT was performed, and the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital.
Dr. Shepard: The repeat chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed resolution of some of the nodules in the lingula and right upper lobe but also an overall increased number of nodules (Figure 1C and 1D).
Dr. Sporn: Six days after her repeat chest CT (6 days before the current admission), the patient was evaluated at the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. She reported that the prednisone had reduced the pain in the right side of her chest. Her exercise capacity had decreased from being able to run 5 miles to having dyspnea after running less than half a mile. A review of systems was notable for occasional night sweats, weight gain of 15 kg in the past year, a faint rash on the abdomen, blurred vision with swelling of the right eyelid that had lasted for 3 weeks, Raynaud’s phenomenon, diffuse joint stiffness and pain, and swelling of the fingers that limited some movements, such as opening jars. She had no fevers, chills, cough, nose or throat symptoms, eye pain or visual field loss, wheezing, palpitations, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits, urinary symptoms, or neurologic symptoms. She reported no sick contacts.
Medical history was notable for hypothyroidism, multiple kidney stones, and depression. Medications included mesalamine, levothyroxine, and escitalopram, as well as lorazepam and inhaled albuterol as needed.
The patient had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 5 years but had quit approximately 20 years before the current admission. She used cannabis oil, but there was no other history of substance use. She previously worked as an educator but had left her job because of illness. She lived in a small town in New England with her spouse and three children. Birds and cats were kept in the home, and she had previously had a cat bite. She reported that she had had no other environmental or occupational exposures. There was no travel history except for a commercial vacation cruise. Family history included celiac disease in her mother and lung cancer in her maternal grandfather, who had been a long-term smoker.
The temporal temperature was 36.5°C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Examination was notable for intermittent shallow breathing and faint crackles in the right lung. The right eyelid was erythematous and mildly swollen.
Blood levels of creatine kinase, aldolase, and rheumatoid factor were normal. Anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Smith, anti-RNP, anti–Jo-1, anti–Scl-70, anti–human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were not detected. Serum tests for cryptococcal antigen and 1,3-β-d-glucan were negative, as were urine tests for blastomyces, coccidioides, and histoplasma antigens. An interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel were also negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital, and repeat CT imaging was scheduled.

During the next 6 days, dyspnea worsened, and diffuse pain with involvement of the chest and fingers persisted. The patient was admitted to the medicine unit of this hospital for additional evaluation. The temporal temperature was 36.1°C, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/85 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was observed to take intermittent, shallow breaths. There were no ulcers or lesions in the oropharynx. A faint erythematous rash was noted under the breasts, but no other rashes were present. Chest discomfort was not reproducible with palpation. There was no swelling, warmth, or erythema of the joints.
Blood levels of high-sensitivity troponin T, NT-proBNP, angiotensin-converting enzyme, galactomannan antigen, and C3 and C4 were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urine levels of human chorionic gonadotropin and anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies were undetectable.
Dr. Shepard: High-resolution chest CT (Figure 1E and 1F) revealed persistent bilateral solid lung nodules with surrounding ground-glass opacities and a small pleural effusion in the right lung. Gallstones and kidney stones were also visible.
Dr. Sporn: On the second hospital day, an ophthalmologic examination performed after dilation revealed blepharitis with a foamy tear layer; there was no uveitis. Oral doxycycline and eye rinses were administered.
On the third hospital day, a transthoracic echocardiogram showed trace right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale but was otherwise was normal. Antitreponemal antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgM and IgG, and β2-glycoprotein 1 IgM and IgG were undetectable.
Diagnostic tests were performed.",Granulomatous lung disease as an extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease.
Case 34-2023: A 49-Year-Old Woman with Loss of Consciousness and Thrombocytopenia,"Dr. Joseph B. Stegeman (Emergency Medicine): A 49-year-old woman was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital after being found unconscious at work.
At approximately 4:30 p.m. on the day of this evaluation, the patient was found unconscious on the floor next to a copy machine at work. Emergency medical services were activated and found the patient to be confused and aphasic; she could say only “yes” and “no.” There was no evidence of incontinence or trauma. A fingerstick blood glucose level was normal. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
On the patient’s arrival at the emergency department, limited additional information was obtained from coworkers and family members. The patient had had coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) 4 weeks earlier and had returned to work after 2 weeks. On the morning before this evaluation, coworkers had observed that she appeared “unwell.” Before 2 p.m., she had participated in a lunchtime conference call and had spoken to family members and colleagues. Her medical history was notable for hypertension, for which she took amlodipine. There was no known family history of neurologic disorders.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3°C, the heart rate 70 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/98 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. On examination, she was aphasic; her speech was described as mumbling, and she was able to answer simple questions only intermittently. Strength and sensation appeared to be grossly intact, but she could not perform rapidly alternating movements or tests of coordination. There was no evidence of head or other trauma. The remainder of the examination was normal. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Shahmir Kamalian: Forty minutes after the patient’s arrival, computed tomography (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, or intracranial or cervical arterial stenosis or occlusion. The dural venous sinuses and deep cerebral veins were patent. A chest radiograph was normal.
FIGURE 1

CT and CT Angiography of the Head.
Dr. Stegeman: Approximately 1 hour after the patient’s arrival, initial laboratory test results were received (Table 1). The blood ethanol level was undetectable, and urine toxicologic screening was negative, as was screening for human chorionic gonadotropin. The blood thyrotropin level was normal. Intravenous normal saline was administered.

Within 2 hours after the patient’s arrival, her aphasia abated; her speech was slow but fluent. On a repeat review of systems, she noted that she had felt warm earlier in the day, but she reported no other symptoms and no use of alcohol or drugs.
Three hours after the patient’s arrival, additional laboratory test results were received (Table 1). Analysis of a peripheral-blood smear showed numerous schistocytes per high-power field, very few platelets, and reticulocytosis.
Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Case 33-2023: An 86-Year-Old Man with Shortness of Breath,"Dr. Elliott Winford (Medicine): An 86-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of shortness of breath.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 months before the current admission, when he began to have shortness of breath that occurred intermittently during his daily walk of 1 to 2 miles. Ten weeks before the current admission, posterior lumbar decompression was performed for the treatment of spinal stenosis. The patient healed from the surgery; however, as his mobility increased, he noticed that shortness of breath occurred more frequently.
During the 7 weeks after the surgery, shortness of breath occurred with decreasing levels of exertion. Three weeks before the current admission, the patient’s symptoms worsened such that he was unable to walk across a room, and he sought evaluation in the primary care clinic of another hospital. The d-dimer level was 3220 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500), and he was instructed to present to the emergency department of this hospital.
On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient described shortness of breath that was worse with exertion or lying down. He also noted mild swelling in the right leg. There was no fever, cough, or chest discomfort. The temporal temperature was 35.8°C, the blood pressure 156/74 mm Hg, the heart rate 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued. The lungs were clear on auscultation; there was a systolic murmur. Trace edema was present in the right leg. The high-sensitivity troponin level was 24 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14), and the N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level was 1105 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 1800). Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus types A and B were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Ryan Chung: Computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography was negative for pulmonary emboli but showed bilateral subpleural clustered nodules and tree-in-bud opacities, as well as ground-glass and reticular opacities at the lung bases. The right atrium and right ventricle were dilated.
Dr. Ada C. Stefanescu Schmidt: Myocardial perfusion imaging, performed after the administration of intravenous regadenoson, revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 75%. There was no evidence of ischemia or infarction.
Dr. Winford: The patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up in the primary care clinic.
During the 2 weeks after hospital discharge, shortness of breath persisted. On the day of the current admission, the patient was unable to walk even a few steps because of his shortness of breath. He returned to the primary care clinic of the other hospital for evaluation. The oxygen saturation was 78% while he was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula, and he was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.
The patient reported that the shortness of breath had worsened such that he used hiking poles to walk to the bathroom and sometimes used a wheelchair. The review of systems was notable for weight loss of 11 kg during the past 3 months, intermittent dizziness, cough that was worse when he was lying down, and diarrhea.
The patient had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, depression, migraines, spinal stenosis, and osteoarthritis. Medications included omeprazole, sertraline, cholecalciferol, and a fluticasone inhaler. He took oxycodone as needed for musculoskeletal pain, and he used an albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was retired and lived in a suburban area of coastal New England with his wife and two dogs. He drank one glass of wine weekly and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His father had died of stroke and his mother of heart disease.
On examination, the blood pressure was 150/73 mm Hg, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.7. The patient appeared tired, and there were telangiectasias on his cheeks. He had dyspnea during the conversation and needed to take short breaks between sentences. He had an elevated jugular venous pressure with a prominent c-v wave; Kussmaul’s sign was absent. Crackles were heard at both lung bases, and there was no wheezing. There was a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, which was heard best at the left lower sternal border, as well as a soft diastolic murmur. The abdomen was nontender on palpation, and the liver was pulsatile. There was 1+ edema in both legs. The NT-proBNP level was 1788 pg per milliliter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Stefanescu Schmidt: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a right bundle-branch block. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) (Figure 1; and Videos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 68%. The right ventricle was dilated, and the interventricular septum was flattened; these findings are consistent with right ventricular volume overload. The tricuspid valve, particularly the septal leaflet, was thickened and retracted and had restricted motion. There was resultant severe tricuspid regurgitation with a large coaptation gap; the jet was directed predominantly toward the atrial septum. The pulmonic valve was thickened, with at least moderate pulmonic regurgitation. The mitral and aortic valves were mildly thickened, without clinically significant stenosis or regurgitation. The right atrium was dilated, and there was a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with right-to-left shunting on color Doppler imaging. The right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated to be 30 mm Hg.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram.
Dr. Winford: Intravenous furosemide was administered. The patient was admitted to the hospital.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Carcinoid heart disease due to a metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid tumor) associated with carcinoid syndrome.
Case 32-2023: A 62-Year-Old Woman with Recurrent Hemorrhagic Pericardial Effusion,"Dr. Nilay K. Patel: A 62-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of recurrent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 months before the current admission, when pleuritic pain and tightness in her chest developed suddenly while she was eating. The chest pain persisted and began to radiate to the neck and back. The symptoms did not abate with aspirin or acetaminophen. Within an hour after symptom onset, she noticed that the pain worsened with exertion and when she was in the supine position; she was also unable to take a full breath and had dizziness with exertion. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.5°C, the heart rate 104 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/91 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Except for the finding of tachycardia, the examination was reportedly normal. The prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) reportedly showed ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion in the anterior and inferior leads. A chest radiograph reportedly showed a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Intravenous heparin was administered. Four hours later, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed according to a pulmonary embolism protocol, reportedly ruled out pulmonary embolism; it also revealed a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with an attenuation level of 34 to 50 Hounsfield units, a mildly dilated ascending aorta (at a diameter of 37 mm; normal diameter, <36 mm on the basis of the patient’s sex and body-surface area), and a pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe that measured 4 mm in diameter. Intravenous heparin was stopped, and protamine sulfate was administered. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of a second hospital 3 hours later.
On arrival at the second hospital, the temporal temperature was 36.5°C, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/75 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. Pulsus paradoxus measured 16 mm Hg. The jugular venous pressure was 12 cm of water. Auscultation revealed tachycardia and a pericardial friction rub. The remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the level of troponin were normal. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia and right-axis deviation, with minor nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities.
Dr. Daniela R. Crousillat: A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a small-to-moderate circumferential pericardial effusion primarily abutting the right atrium and right ventricle with right atrial inversion and intermittent diastolic inversion of the right ventricle (Figure 1A). There was increased respiratory variation in the mitral inflow velocities and a dilated inferior vena cava with reduced respirophasic collapse; both these features were suggestive of the presence of physiologic characteristics of early tamponade (Figure 1B and Video 1). Colchicine and ibuprofen were administered, and the patient was admitted to the second hospital.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies Obtained before This Admission.
Dr. Patel: The next morning, pericardiocentesis was performed under fluoroscopic guidance with the use of a subxiphoid approach, and 200 ml of bloody fluid was drained; the intrapericardial pressure decreased from 12 mm Hg to 4 mm Hg. Analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed 4,700,000 erythrocytes per microliter and 12,010 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 78% were neutrophils, 13% monocytes, 8% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. Gram’s staining revealed neutrophils and no organisms. The pericardial fluid albumin level was 3.0 g per deciliter, the total protein level 4.7 g per deciliter, the lactate dehydrogenase level 614 U per liter, the glucose level 71 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter), and the amylase level 31 U per liter.
Dr. Vinit Baliyan: On the second hospital day, a CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest showed a reduction in hemopericardium, and a pericardial drain was visible; there was no aortic dissection. There was an atrial septal occluder device in place that appeared to be in an appropriate position. The device appeared to be relatively large and abutted the aortic root anteriorly (Figure 1C). However, there was no evidence of erosion of the device into the aortic wall (known as device erosion) or pseudoaneurysm formation (Figure 1D).
Dr. Patel: On the third hospital day, no pericardial effusion was detected on TTE. Cytologic analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed reactive mesothelial cells, neutrophils, histiocytes, and eosinophils, with no malignant cells. The patient was discharged home with prescriptions for colchicine and ibuprofen.
Ten days after discharge from the second hospital, the patient had a follow-up visit with her cardiologist and reported that the chest pain and dyspnea had resolved. The heart rate was 94 beats per minute, the blood pressure 159/88 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the examination was normal. The antinuclear antibody titer was 1:160, with a homogeneous pattern, and a test for rheumatoid factor was negative. CT of the chest, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small-volume pericardial effusion, mild bronchial wall thickening, and a 4-mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe. Colchicine treatment was stopped.
Six weeks before the current admission, the patient called her primary care physician to report recurrent back pain and dyspnea that she noted were similar to her previous presentation; treatment with colchicine was resumed. During the next 12 days, sinus pressure, myalgias, nasal congestion, and cough productive of green sputum developed, and she was seen by her primary care physician. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, the blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 94% while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. A screening test for respiratory viruses was negative. A chest radiograph reportedly showed clear lungs. Doxycycline was prescribed.
Four days before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by her cardiologist at this hospital and reported ongoing cough and dyspnea. The heart rate was 87 beats per minute, and the blood pressure was 138/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was normal.
Dr. Crousillat: A TTE showed recurrence of a moderate pericardial effusion, measuring up to 14 mm in end diastole, that was adjacent to the right ventricular free wall. There was evidence of right ventricular diastolic inversion that was suggestive of the physiologic characteristics of tamponade (Figure 2A and 2B). The patient was admitted to the cardiology floor of this hospital.
FIGURE 2

Echocardiograms Obtained on This Admission.
Dr. Patel: On evaluation, the patient reported that she had had episodes of dyspnea and cough with sputum production and a decrease in exercise tolerance in the weeks before this admission. She had no known sick contacts.
The patient’s medical history was notable for postoperative pulmonary embolism, hypertension, dyslipidemia, recurrent episodes of syncope with cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses on tilt testing, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (for which she used a continuous positive airway pressure device), obesity, tubular adenomas (colonic polyps), hepatic steatosis, hiatal hernia, osteopenia, and cataracts. She also had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; on previous pulmonary-function testing, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 0.92 liters (39% of the predicted value), and the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity was 47%.
Five and a half years before the current admission, the patient had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and abdominoplasty that had resulted in postoperative hemorrhage; she had lost 44 kg of weight after the sleeve gastrectomy. Fourteen years before this admission, the patient had undergone percutaneous transcatheter closure of a fenestrated atrial septal defect (ASD) with an interatrial septal aneurysm and a right-to-left shunt that was possibly related to recurrent transient ischemic attacks; the procedure had been performed with a 30-mm Amplatzer septal occluder device. She had had mammography and cervical cancer screening within the 16 months before this admission.
Medications included colchicine, apixaban, losartan, theophylline, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, a multivitamin, and inhaled tiotropium and mometasone–formoterol, as well as furosemide and albuterol as needed. Topiramate had caused paresthesia. The patient lived in Massachusetts with her husband and was a business owner. She had a 40-pack-year history of cigarette smoking and had quit smoking 10 years earlier; she did not drink alcohol or use other substances. Her family history was notable for coronary artery disease in her mother and father, stroke in her maternal grandmother and paternal grandfather, and seizure in a nephew.
The temporal temperature was 36.9°C, the heart rate 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Pulsus paradoxus measured 10 mm Hg. The height was 163 cm and the weight 67 kg; the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.2. On examination, the jugular venous pressure was 10 cm of water. Auscultation revealed tachycardia, with no murmur or rub. The remainder of the examination was normal.
The prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An ECG showed irregular tachycardia of uncertain underlying rhythm, low voltage in the limb leads, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and a rightward axis.
Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",Amplatzer septal occluder device erosion.
Case 31-2023: A 79-Year-Old Man with Involuntary Movements and Unresponsiveness,"Dr. Carrie Chui (Neurology): A 79-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of involuntary movements on the left side and transient unresponsiveness.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before admission, when involuntary movements of the left shoulder and left side of the face developed. The movements were described by the patient as twitching, were not associated with a change in the level of consciousness, and resolved after 1 to 2 minutes. During the next 6 months, the patient had similar episodes approximately once per month, but the episodes increased in duration, lasting 5 to 6 minutes.
Three months before admission, the episodes of involuntary movements increased in frequency, and the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The physical examination was normal. Results of kidney-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose and electrolytes, except for the sodium level, which was 129 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). There was a history of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and the sodium level was similar to levels obtained during the past 4 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a focus of enhancement in the right middle frontal gyrus that was thought to be a small vascular anomaly. Electroencephalography (EEG), performed with the patient in awake and drowsy states, revealed rare, brief, focal slowing in the left temporal lobe during drowsiness; no epileptiform abnormalities were present.
FIGURE 1

MRI of the Head and CT Angiogram of the Head and Neck.
Two months before admission, the patient was evaluated in the epilepsy clinic affiliated with this hospital. He reported that the episodes of involuntary movements had increased in both frequency and duration, occurring once or twice per day and lasting approximately 10 minutes. Episodes began with tingling and numbness in the left leg that prompted the patient to voluntarily stomp the left foot to relieve the uncomfortable sensation. Then, the patient had involuntary movements that he described as an uncontrollable invisible force moving the left leg and arm, with hyperextension of the arm backward and pronation of the wrist. There was associated numbness in the distal portions of the left third, fourth, and fifth fingers and involuntary movement of the left cheek. No prodromal symptoms occurred. The patient had awareness during the episodes, and after the episodes, he felt fatigued but had a normal level of consciousness, without confusion. The examination in the epilepsy clinic was normal. A diagnosis of seizure disorder was considered, and treatment with levetiracetam was started.
Three weeks before admission, the patient was again evaluated in the epilepsy clinic. He reported that the episodes of involuntary movements still occurred on a daily basis but had decreased in duration and involved only the left leg, without abnormal movements of the arm or face. Dizziness, headache, and weakness had developed and were attributed to the use of levetiracetam. The patient’s family had recorded a video of one of the episodes of involuntary movements. After reviewing the video, the patient’s neurologist thought that the episodes were less likely to be caused by seizures and more consistent with choreoathetoid movements. Cross-tapering of medications — with the simultaneous administration of levetiracetam in decreasing doses and clobazam in increasing doses — was initiated, and the patient was referred to the movement disorders clinic affiliated with this hospital.
On the morning of admission, an episode of involuntary movements of the left leg and left shoulder occurred and persisted for 1 hour. Several hours after the symptoms abated, the patient’s wife found the patient to be unresponsive; he was sitting in a chair. Emergency medical services were called, and when they arrived, the patient was responsive. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 180 mg per deciliter (10.0 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported dysuria and increased urinary frequency. The patient’s daughter noted that he had been more anxious during the past 3 years and occasionally had trouble with memory. Other medical history included Barrett’s esophagus, benign prostatic hypertrophy, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, eczema, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and osteoporosis. There was no history of head trauma or extended loss of consciousness. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, doxazosin, finasteride, omeprazole, metoprolol, sacubitril, and valsartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol rarely; he did not use illicit drugs. His mother had had gastric cancer, and his sister had had esophageal cancer; there was no family history of seizures.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 152/97 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.7. The blood pressure decreased to 130/63 mm Hg with standing. The patient was alert and interactive. The lower jaw was held to the left, but the nasolabial folds and smile were symmetric with activation. There were nonrhythmic, nonstereotyped, writhing movements of the left arm. Tone was normal, and strength was assessed as 5 out of 5 in the arms and legs. Results of liver-function and kidney-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose and electrolytes, except for the sodium level, which was 125 mmol per liter. The lactate level was 2.1 mmol per liter (19 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]). The urinalysis was normal. Intravenous fluids were administered. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Rajiv Gupta: Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1B) revealed extensively calcified plaque with severe stenosis of the distal right common carotid artery (CCA), extending into the proximal right internal carotid artery (ICA), as well as stenosis of the right and left paraclinoid ICAs and the left vertebral artery at its origin. There was no vascular abnormality on the CT angiogram that corresponded to the abnormality in the right middle frontal gyrus seen on the previous MRI.
Dr. Chui: The patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the sodium level had increased to 130 mmol per liter, and the lactate level was normal. Additional imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Gupta: MRI of the head showed no evidence of acute infarction. The focus of enhancement in the right frontal lobe that had been noted previously was not seen on the current MRI.
Dr. Chui: Blood levels of thyrotropin, cobalamin, and glycated hemoglobin and results of coagulation tests were normal. Screening tests for Lyme disease, tuberculosis, and syphilis were negative, as were tests for antibodies to cardiolipin and β2-glycoprotein. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive, at a titer of 1:160 in a homogeneous pattern. During a physical therapy session, the patient had abnormal movements of the left leg, left arm, and left side of the face. The abnormal movements diminished when the patient used distraction techniques, such as thigh tapping, finger snapping, and walking while holding a glass of water.
The transient unresponsiveness that led to the patient’s admission was attributed to a combination of sedation from clobazam and hypovolemia. Treatment with clobazam was stopped, and hydration was encouraged. A diagnosis of functional neurologic disorder was considered; outpatient physical therapy with continued use of distraction techniques was recommended. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day.
Episodes of involuntary movements continued to occur on a daily basis at home. Two weeks after discharge, when the patient was doing exercises while sitting in a chair and having a conversation with his wife, he suddenly stopped talking. She found him slumped in the chair with his eyes closed, no longer exercising. When she asked him questions, he repeatedly said “yes.” Emergency medical services were called, and when they arrived, the patient was alert, diaphoretic, and nonverbal. He had a facial droop on the left side and a right gaze preference. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 130 mg per deciliter (7.2 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
In the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 143/63 mm Hg, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and interactive. There was a facial droop on the left side. There was no effort against gravity in the left arm. The patient was able to lift the left leg off the bed for 1 to 2 seconds. He had a right gaze deviation that could not be overcome and mild dysarthria. The remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of stroke was considered, and emergency CT angiography was performed.
Dr. Gupta: CT angiography showed no evidence of acute territorial infarction and no changes in cerebrovascular disease.
Dr. Chui: On repeat physical examination performed after CT angiography, the gaze deviation and dysarthria had resolved, and strength was normal. Mild facial paralysis was present.
A diagnosis was made.",Limb-shaking transient ischemic attacks.
Case 30-2023: A 50-Year-Old Woman with Confusion,"Dr. Grace R. Bobkowski (Medicine): A 50-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of confusion.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 months before the current presentation, when dysphagia developed. One month later, she was evaluated by her primary care physician. She reported having a sensation that pills and food were getting stuck in her throat when she swallowed. She was unable to take her medications, and her food intake had decreased to two eggs per day. She estimated that her weight had decreased by 5 kg during the previous month. She was referred for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which reportedly revealed ulceration of the gastrojejunal junction from a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass performed 12 years earlier but otherwise normal mucosa. Examination of biopsy specimens obtained during the procedure reportedly revealed findings consistent with lymphocytic esophagitis. Treatment with swallowed fluticasone was recommended.
Three months before the current presentation, leg swelling developed, and the patient was again evaluated by her primary care physician. She had stopped using fluticasone after 1 week of treatment because she had not noticed any decrease in the dysphagia. Her weight had decreased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month earlier. Pitting edema was present in the legs. A diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency was considered, and compression stockings were recommended.
Two months before the current presentation, leg swelling worsened, arm swelling developed, and the patient had trouble performing activities of daily living. She was admitted to another hospital. She reported persistent dysphagia and reduced food intake. Her weight had increased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month earlier. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The blood albumin level was 2.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.5 to 4.8), and the zinc level was 0.36 μg per milliliter (reference range, 0.66 to 1.10). Blood levels of vitamin B2, vitamin B12, folate, and methylmalonate were normal; the blood level of N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide was normal for the patient’s age. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The albumin:creatinine ratio in a random urine sample was 11.6 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine (reference value, <30.0). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Abdominal ultrasonography reportedly revealed an echogenic liver, a finding consistent with fatty infiltration, as well as trace free fluid. Pitting edema of the arms and legs was attributed to hypoalbuminemia from limited oral intake, which was related to dysphagia from untreated lymphocytic esophagitis. The use of fluticasone was encouraged, and supplemental nutritional drinks were recommended, along with a multivitamin and zinc sulfate. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was discharged home.
One month before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to this hospital because of confusion and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Escherichia coli. Confusion resolved with treatment of the UTI. Her weight had decreased by 2 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. The patient reported loose stools without blood or mucus, which had occurred for 1 month. Edema was present. The blood albumin level was 1.7 g per deciliter, the zinc level 0.3 μg per milliliter, the selenium level 34 ng per milliliter (reference range, 70 to 150), the vitamin A level 16.6 μg per deciliter (reference range, 32.5 to 78.0), and the vitamin C level 0.2 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.4 to 2.0). Blood levels of vitamin B1 and vitamin B3 were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
EGD showed ulceration of the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. Biopsy specimens of the esophagus, stomach, and jejunum showed normal mucosa. A biopsy specimen of the gastrojejunal anastomosis showed small-intestinal mucosa with erosion and nonspecific morphologic features; periodic acid–Schiff staining was negative for microorganisms, Congo red staining was negative for amyloid, and immunohistochemical staining was negative for cytomegalovirus. Magnetic resonance enterography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of active inflammatory bowel disease. A high-protein diet was recommended, along with a multivitamin, zinc sulfate, and selenium. On the eighth hospital day, the patient was discharged home.
After discharge, the patient initially felt well. The edema abated, and her appetite improved. She began to have six small meals and three protein shakes per day. Two weeks after discharge, and 1 week before the current presentation, confusion developed, and the gait became unsteady; she began using a walker for ambulation. During the next week, confusion increased, and she fell while walking. Her family brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
On the patient’s arrival in the emergency department, she was unable to answer questions about her history. Her family reported that she had had slowed and slurred speech for the past week and increasing difficulty with attention, including difficulty with holding a conversation. Other medical history included chronic back pain, bipolar disorder, seizure disorder, and ulcerative colitis. Medications included carbamazepine, ergocalciferol, fluticasone, gabapentin, mesalamine, methocarbamol, mirtazapine, a multivitamin, olanzapine, omeprazole, oxycodone–acetaminophen, selenium, sucralfate, thiamine, topiramate, and zinc sulfate. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was receiving disability benefits and did not work because of chronic back pain. She had smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 35 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had endometrial cancer, and her father had lung cancer.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 89/52 mm Hg, the pulse 132 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.9. Her weight had decreased by 6 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. She appeared chronically ill and was lethargic but arose in response to voice. She moved her arms and legs but did not participate in a detailed neurologic examination. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The white-cell count was 17,150 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with neutrophil predominance. The blood zinc level was 0.35 μg per milliliter, the copper level 0.28 μg per milliliter (reference range, 0.75 to 1.45), and the vitamin B6 level less than 2 μg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50). Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and 50 to 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
A chest radiograph was normal, without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Urine, blood, and stool specimens were obtained for culture. Three liters of intravenous lactated Ringer’s solution were administered, and the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Three hours after the patient’s arrival in the emergency department, she became more lethargic and had no response to voice; she reacted to being shaken but did not open her eyes or answer questions. Additional imaging studies were performed.
Dr. Theodore T. Pierce: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed no abnormalities. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse hepatic steatosis, as well as mucosal hyperenhancement and submucosal edema involving portions of the small and large bowel, with relative sparing of the distal jejunum, proximal ileum, descending colon, and sigmoid colon.

Dr. Bobkowski: Treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was initiated. Six hours after the patient’s arrival in the emergency department, the blood pressure decreased to 85/45 mm Hg, and the heart rate increased to 132 beats per minute. There was no response to painful stimuli. Myoclonic jerking movements were observed. Treatment with norepinephrine was initiated, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The trachea was intubated for airway protection, and sedation with propofol and dexmedetomidine was initiated. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was continued; prescribed medications of carbamazepine, a multivitamin, omeprazole, selenium, sucralfate, thiamine, topiramate, and zinc sulfate were administered.
On the first hospital day, the blood pressure increased, and vasopressors and sedative medications were discontinued. The patient had no spontaneous interaction or speech production. She did not follow commands or grimace in response to noxious stimuli. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The corneal reflexes were intact, as were the cough and gag reflexes. There was no spontaneous movement of the arms or legs, but they withdrew in response to pain; the deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The results of CT of the head were normal. Sedation was not resumed, and serial neurologic examinations were performed.
On the second hospital day, leukocytosis had resolved, but the patient’s mental status had not improved. Electroencephalography (EEG) with long-term monitoring revealed near-continuous generalized periodic discharges with triphasic morphologic features, often with superimposed rhythmic activity. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head were normal, as were the results of magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck. Lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed normal protein levels and no nucleated cells. The urine culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. The blood and stool cultures were negative, as was a stool test for Clostridioides difficile and an examination of the stool for ova and parasites. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was stopped, and treatment with ciprofloxacin was started.
On the third hospital day, the patient’s mental status had not improved. EGD showed a small scar at the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. The results of flexible sigmoidoscopy were normal. Biopsy specimens of the jejunum and descending colon showed normal mucosa.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Noncirrhotic hyperammonemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
Case 29-2023: A 34-Year-Old Woman with Abdominal Distention and Acute Kidney Injury,"Dr. Matthew B. Roberts (Medicine): A 34-year-old woman with a history of end-stage liver disease due to alcohol use disorder was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal distention, fatigue, and acute kidney injury that occurred 10 months after orthotopic liver transplantation.
Two weeks before the current admission, fatigue, weakness, and anorexia developed, along with associated myalgias and night sweats. Three days before the current admission, three to five episodes of nonbloody, watery diarrhea occurred.
The next day, symptoms did not abate, and the patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. She reported no fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspnea, or swelling of the legs. The temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 76/49 mm Hg, the pulse 132 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. She appeared thin and frail. There was abdominal distention without tenderness. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The blood creatinine level was 3.25 mg per deciliter (287 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.55 to 1.30 mg per deciliter [49 to 115 μmol per liter]), which was higher than the level obtained 1 month earlier (1.27 mg per deciliter [112 μmol per liter]). The blood sodium level was 120 mmol per liter (reference range, 136 to 146) and the potassium level 6.3 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.2); additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Three liters of fluids, hydrocortisone, piperacillin–tazobactam, and vancomycin were administered intravenously, and the blood pressure increased. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a large volume of ascitic fluid and scattered areas of high-density material. Paracentesis was performed, and 1300 ml of ascitic fluid was removed. Analysis of the ascitic fluid was notable for more than 1000 red cells per microliter, 2099 nucleated cells per microliter (with 400 neutrophils per microliter), and numerous atypical cells that were not further characterized. Blood and ascitic fluid specimens were obtained for culture.
On the second hospital day, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital because of concern for sepsis. She reported persistent fatigue, weakness, myalgias, and watery diarrhea.
Additional history was obtained. Twenty-two months before this admission, the patient had been admitted to the other hospital because of abnormal results on liver-function tests. She had received a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis complicated by cirrhosis with ascites. Treatment with a short course of prednisone had been initiated, furosemide administered, and large-volume paracentesis performed for the management of ascites. The patient had been advised to discontinue alcohol consumption. Ten months later, and 12 months before the current admission, the patient had been admitted to this hospital because of decompensated liver disease complicated by hepatorenal syndrome. Renal replacement therapy had been initiated, and small-volume paracentesis had been performed to obtain ascitic fluid for cytologic and hematologic analysis.
Dr. Robert P. Hasserjian: Analysis of the ascitic fluid performed 12 months before the current admission had been notable for 44 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 1% were lymphocytes, 53% monocytes, 17% macrophages, and 29% atypical-appearing plasma cells (Figure 1A). These findings had prompted flow cytometric analysis of the ascitic fluid, which had revealed a clonal plasma cell population with lambda light-chain restriction (Figure 1B) but no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population.
FIGURE 1

Ascitic Fluid Specimen Obtained before Transplantation.
Dr. Roberts: Twelve months before the current admission, the serum IgG level had been 1394 mg per deciliter (reference range, 614 to 1295), the IgA level 885 mg per deciliter (reference range, 69 to 309), and the IgM level 177 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334). Serum protein electrophoresis had revealed a diffuse increase in the gamma globulin level in a normal pattern; no monoclonal protein had been detected on immunofixation. The serum level of free kappa light chains had been 246.2 mg per liter (reference range, 3.3 to 19.4) and the level of free lambda light chains 78.4 mg per liter (reference range, 5.7 to 26.3), with a kappa:lambda ratio of 3.14 (reference range, 0.26 to 1.65). A bone marrow biopsy had been performed, and analysis of the bone marrow had revealed 5% plasma cells, which were polytypic for kappa and lambda light chains on in situ hybridization. Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow had revealed no clonal plasma cells or abnormal lymphocytes. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis had revealed a cirrhotic liver with evidence of portal hypertension, including abdominal varices and ascites, but no focal masses or lymphadenopathy.
Taken together, these findings had been considered to be due to liver disease, an inflammatory state, and kidney dysfunction, and the patient had been listed for liver transplantation. Ten months before the current admission, orthotopic liver transplantation had been performed. Pretransplantation testing for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) IgG and cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG had been positive in both the donor and the recipient. The explanted native liver had shown micronodular cirrhosis with mildly inflamed septa and evidence of iron overload. The immediate post-transplantation course had been notable for intraperitoneal hemorrhage, as well as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and recurrent peritonitis. The patient had been discharged to a rehabilitation facility 21 days after transplantation.
Three months after liver transplantation, and 7 months before the current admission, biliary stent obstruction and multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia had developed. The biliary stent had been removed and intravenous antibiotic agents administered. Four months before the current admission, asymptomatic CMV viremia had developed. Outpatient treatment with valganciclovir had been initiated. The patient had remained well until the current admission.
At the time of the current admission, medications included aspirin, atovaquone, vitamin B complex, calcium citrate, vitamin D3, ferrous sulfate, fludrocortisone, gabapentin, magnesium, melatonin, mycophenolate, omeprazole, prednisone, tacrolimus, and ursodiol. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in New England and lived with her mother. She had not traveled outside the region, and there had been no animal exposures. The patient had stopped drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes approximately 2 years before the current admission. There was no illicit drug use. Her mother and father both had cardiac and liver disease; her maternal grandfather also had liver disease.
On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 100/53 mm Hg, the heart rate 114 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21. The patient appeared thin and frail. An abdominal examination revealed moderate distention, shifting dullness, and softness without tenderness. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with intravenous cefepime and linezolid and oral vancomycin was initiated, and intravenous fluids were continued. Blood, urine, and stool specimens were obtained for culture.
Dr. Mark A. Anderson: PET-CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed multifocal, predominantly peritoneal FDG-avid masses, as well as diffuse FDG uptake along the surface of large-bowel and small-bowel loops (Figure 2). These findings had not been present on a CT scan obtained 1 year earlier.
FIGURE 2

Abdominal Images.
Dr. Roberts: Testing for Clostridioides difficile toxin in stool was positive. Treatment with intravenous antibiotics was stopped, and oral vancomycin was continued. The diarrhea abated, and the hypotension resolved. On the third hospital day, the blood creatinine level decreased to 2.25 mg per deciliter (199 μmol per liter); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood, urine, and stool cultures were negative. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed, and analysis of the ascitic fluid was notable for 2018 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 30% were unclassified; additional results are shown in Table 1.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Plasma cell myeloma (multiple myeloma).
Case 28-2023: A 37-Year-Old Man with a Rash,"Dr. Stephanie Lin-Beckford (Medicine): A 37-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a rash.
The patient had been well until 9 days before this admission, when a diffuse rash developed on the hands and feet. During the next 3 days, the rash spread proximally to the arms and the legs, then extended to the groin, trunk, and face. Six days before this admission, the patient noticed new throat tightness and lip swelling. Three days before this admission, when difficulty with swallowing and shortness of breath developed, the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital.
On evaluation at the other hospital, the patient reported that he had received an mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine on the day before the rash appeared. Vital signs and results of routine laboratory tests were reportedly normal. Treatment with dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, famotidine, and intravenous fluids was administered. The patient was discharged home.
During the next 3 days, the symptoms did not abate. On the day of this admission, the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. He described having difficulty with opening his mouth because of pain in his lips, as well as mild difficulty with swallowing and breathing. The rash had become more confluent over the arms, legs, chest, back, face, and groin, and there was increased redness and swelling. The patient described the rash as mildly itchy and painful and stated that the affected skin felt “tight.” A review of systems was notable for fatigue, malaise, chills, and night sweats, as well as intermittent nausea, abdominal pain, watery stools, and dysuria. He had no fever, headache, cough, myalgias, or arthralgias.
The patient had no known medical conditions, took no medications, and had no known drug allergies. He was born in coastal South America and had immigrated to the United States 17 years before this admission. He lived in suburban New England with extended family members and had no pets; he had not traveled recently and had no known sick contacts. The patient worked in environmental services and wore gloves whenever he used cleaning products. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years; he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He was sexually active and reported that his last episode of unprotected sexual intercourse had been with a female partner 2 years before this admission. No family members had autoimmune diseases or skin conditions.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 37.1°C, the heart rate 105 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/92 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was fissuring at the oral commissures, and the posterior oropharynx had a cobblestone appearance; no mucosal lesions were noted. There was no conjunctival injection. The lungs were clear on auscultation. No joint swelling or cervical lymphadenopathy was present, but he had nontender bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Morbilliform macules, papules, and plaques were observed on the arms, legs, chest, back, face, scalp, groin, and penis (Figure 1). The rash became confluent at the dorsa and palms of the hands and at the dorsa and soles of the feet. No skin sloughing, erosions, ulcers, vesicles, or bullae were present. The complete blood count, blood levels of electrolytes, and results of tests of kidney and liver function were normal. The C-reactive protein level was 16.7 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 30 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13). Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Case 27-2023: A 53-Year-Old Woman with Celiac Disease and Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding,"Dr. Emily W. Lopes: A 53-year-old woman with celiac disease was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital for the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with hemorrhagic shock.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 3 weeks before the current presentation, when fatigue, malaise, anorexia, generalized weakness, and watery diarrhea developed. Two weeks later, the diarrhea increased in frequency and became bloody. The patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.
On examination, the blood pressure was 63/32 mm Hg, the hemoglobin level 6.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), the international normalized ratio 7.63 (reference range, 0.90 to 1.10), the creatinine level 1.4 mg per deciliter (124 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.5 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [44 to 115 μmol per liter]), the alkaline phosphatase level 330 U per liter (reference range, 56 to 136), the albumin level 1.4 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.5), and the lactate level 3.3 mmol per liter (30 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]). Normal saline, albumin, norepinephrine, fresh-frozen plasma, vitamin K, 4 units of packed red cells, vancomycin, piperacillin–tazobactam, octreotide, and pantoprazole were administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.
Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of oral contrast material, reportedly revealed ground-glass opacities in the lungs, pulmonary nodules, esophageal dilatation, and diffuse osteopenia, along with ascites, hepatic steatosis, diffuse bowel-wall thickening, dilated loops of small bowel, and horseshoe kidney. A heterogeneous mass, measuring 11 cm by 8 cm by 7 cm, with internal necrosis was identified near the pancreatic tail. Abdominal ultrasonography reportedly showed a cirrhotic-appearing liver and ascites. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was reportedly notable for severe esophagitis but showed no source of acute bleeding.
During the first 7 hospital days, diarrhea continued, with an output of up to 2 liters of green liquid stool daily. Examination of a stool specimen was reportedly positive for leukocytes and negative for Clostridioides difficile and Shiga toxin, as well as campylobacter, giardia, and cryptosporidium antigens.
On hospital day 7, anuria occurred, and the bladder pressure was 23 mm Hg. Paracentesis was performed for the treatment of abdominal distention, and 3.7 liters of ascitic fluid was removed. Testing of the ascitic fluid revealed 14,000 erythrocytes per microliter and 91 neutrophils per microliter. The albumin level in ascitic fluid was 0.3 g per deciliter; the concurrent serum albumin level was 3.2 g per deciliter. No organisms were detected on Gram’s staining of the ascitic fluid. Norepinephrine and albumin were administered intravenously.
The next day, there was an output of copious black stool. The hemoglobin level decreased from 8.1 g per deciliter to 5.1 g per deciliter; additional norepinephrine was administered intravenously, along with 4 units of packed red cells, cryoprecipitate, vitamin K, and fresh-frozen plasma. Intubation of the trachea was performed for repeat EGD, which reportedly revealed a pulsatile vascular lesion in the distal esophagus; blood was detected around the lesion. Octreotide and pantoprazole were administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to the ICU of this hospital.
Because the patient had undergone intubation, the medical history was initially obtained from her husband and was limited. Celiac disease had been diagnosed in her late 30s, but she did not follow a gluten-free diet. Her one pregnancy had been complicated by severe gestational hypertension, with delivery by cesarean section performed at 33 weeks’ gestation. Menopause had occurred in her mid-40s. Recurrent otitis media had led to tympanic membrane perforation and resultant chronic hearing loss. In the past year, she had lost 7 kg of weight unintentionally. In the 2 weeks before she was admitted to the other hospital, after the onset of diarrhea, she had had a decreased appetite and had eaten only candy and cereal, with 2 kg of weight loss.
The patient attended college and worked as a technical consultant. She lived with her husband. She had no history of nicotine, alcohol, or illicit substance use. She took no medications or supplements, and there were no known adverse reactions to medications. Her family history included stroke in her father, colon cancer in her paternal grandfather, and pancreatic cancer in a paternal great-grandfather and a paternal aunt. She had an adult child, who was healthy.
On examination in the ICU, the patient appeared chronically ill. The temporal temperature was 37.1°C, the heart rate 91 beats per minute, the blood pressure 102/67 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 98% while she was receiving mechanical ventilation on a spontaneous-breathing mode (positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; fraction of inspired oxygen, 35%). The height was 142 cm, the weight 50.6 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.1. The bladder pressure was 12 mm Hg. The sclerae were icteric, and the skin was jaundiced. The corners of the mouth were inflamed, erythematous, and crusted. The abdomen was distended, and a fluid wave was present. The palmar surfaces appeared mildly erythematous and denuded, and there were pigmented nevi on the back and shoulder. Symmetric 1+ pitting edema was observed in the lower legs.
The calcium and phosphorus levels were normal. Tests for hepatitis A antibodies, hepatitis B surface antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigens, hepatitis B core antibodies, hepatitis C antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and liver–kidney–microsomal autoantibodies type 1 were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Stool was obtained for culture and examination for ova and parasites. Albumin, 2 units of packed red cells, ceftriaxone, propofol, pantoprazole, and octreotide were administered intravenously.

EGD was performed the next morning (Figure 1). There was a blind-ended submucosal pouch that suggested the possibility of an intramural dissection in the posterior esophagus. Severe esophagitis, cratered esophageal ulcers, and a distal esophageal varix with an overlying fibrin plug were noted. An attempt at esophageal band ligation was unsuccessful, with unroofing of the fibrin clot and active spurting of blood. Two clips were applied for hemostasis. Hematin was found throughout the stomach. The duodenal bulb appeared nodular, and the duodenal mucosa appeared scalloped; a duodenal biopsy was performed. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

EGD Images.
Dr. Ranjodh S. Dhami: CT angiography of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed for assessment of the esophageal vessels and possible esophageal perforation (Figure 2). Multiple esophageal, perigastric, and perisplenic varices were present. A 1.8-cm esophageal diverticulum, pneumomediastinum, and foci of air in the retropharyngeal space and other deep spaces of the neck were noted, along with diffuse hepatic steatosis (without morphologic features of cirrhosis), mild splenomegaly, horseshoe kidney, and diffuse thickening of the small and large bowel walls. An enhancing, centrally hypodense left retroperitoneal mass, measuring 10.7 cm in greatest dimension, was present. There was diffuse mottling of bones.

Dr. Lopes: In the first 24 hours of hospitalization, there was an output of 800 ml of red liquid stool. On hospital day 2, a total of 3 units of packed red cells were administered. On hospital day 3, transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular function, aortic-valve sclerosis, and mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Additional diagnostic tests were performed.","Turner syndrome associated with celiac disease, hepatic steatosis, portosinusoidal vascular disorder, and paraganglioma and schwannoma."
Case 26-2023: A 15-Year-Old Girl with Abdominal Pain and an Ovarian Mass,"Dr. Margaret R. Connolly (Surgery): A 15-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and an ovarian mass.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 6 weeks before the current presentation, when lower abdominal pain developed along the midline. The pain was sharp and crampy, increased with movement, and decreased with lying down. During the next 24 hours, the pain shifted from the midline to the right side. The patient was taken to the emergency department of a hospital affiliated with this hospital for evaluation.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 125/82 mm Hg, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The lower abdomen had mild tenderness that was present on both sides but was greater on the right side. The abdomen was soft and nondistended. Bowel sounds were normal, and there was no rebound, guarding, or tenderness at the costovertebral angle. The white-cell count was 14,270 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,500) and the hemoglobin level 10.9 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The urinalysis was normal. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were performed.

Dr. Ali Pourvaziri: Transabdominal ultrasonography with Doppler analysis revealed a complex, thick-walled cyst in the right ovary. There were multiple follicular cysts, measuring up to 1.7 cm in diameter, in the left ovary. Doppler flow was normal in both ovaries. There was a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. The appendix was not visualized.
Dr. Connolly: Acetaminophen, ketorolac, and intravenous fluids were administered. A diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst was considered, and the patient was discharged home with plans to undergo repeat transabdominal ultrasonography 6 weeks later.
After the patient was discharged from the emergency department, the abdominal pain slowly resolved. Three days after discharge, the patient resumed competitive long-distance running. Five weeks later, and 4 days before the current presentation, she participated in a running competition. The next day, abdominal pain recurred, and the patient was unable to go to school. She took ibuprofen, but it did not alleviate the pain. She was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
The patient reported that the current episode of abdominal pain was similar to the episode that had occurred 6 weeks earlier. She had no fever, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dysuria, hematuria, frequent urination, or vaginal bleeding or discharge. She had noticed an increase in her waist size during the past 2 weeks and had difficulty fitting into her pants.
The patient had no notable medical history. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She had normal growth and development; menarche had not occurred. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. The patient lived in suburban New England with her parents and sister. She was not sexually active and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her parents and sister were healthy; menarche had occurred in her mother and sister when they were each 12 years of age.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 141/89 mm Hg, and the pulse 95 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.7. The right lower abdomen was firm and distended, with mild tenderness. Bowel sounds were normal, and there was no rebound, guarding, or evidence of a discrete mass or hepatosplenomegaly on palpation. Development of pubic hair and breasts was classified as Tanner stage 4 (with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development). The white-cell count was 16,120 per microliter and the hemoglobin level 10.1 g per deciliter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were performed.
Dr. Pourvaziri: Transabdominal ultrasonography with Doppler analysis revealed a heterogeneous mass, measuring 16.6 cm by 15.6 cm by 9.9 cm, that was inseparable from the right ovary with the use of probe pressure maneuvers. The mass had normal vascular flow and areas of increased echogenicity. The left ovary was normal, and there was a moderate-to-large amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed a heterogeneously attenuating mass, measuring 17.8 cm by 13.6 cm by 8.6 cm, that displaced the bowel and pelvic viscera. The mass had prominent amorphous, peripherally enhancing components and internal vasculature. The right ovary was not definitively identified separately. There was a large amount of ascitic fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis (Figure 1), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, also showed a heterogeneous mass with thick, nodular, peripheral enhancement that appeared to originate from the right adnexa. The endometrial lining appeared thickened, measuring up to 22 mm in thickness.

Dr. Connolly: The patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.",Juvenile granulosa-cell tumor.
Case 25-2023: An 18-Year-Old Man with Fever and Foot Pain,"Dr. Daniele Lerner (Pediatrics): An 18-year-old man with the Dravet syndrome was admitted to this hospital because of fever and increased frequency of seizures.
The Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes the sodium channel α1 subunit (SCN1A), had been diagnosed during evaluation for intractable seizures that had begun when the patient was 6 months of age. He had had developmental delay, was nonverbal, and required supervision while walking because of a slow, shuffling gait with associated falls.
The patient was in his usual state of health until 2 months before this admission, when his parents noticed swelling of the left foot after a fall. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital, and radiography of the left foot was reportedly normal.
Two weeks before this admission, swelling of the left foot increased. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician, and additional imaging of the foot was recommended. The patient was already scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (which was planned to be performed with the patient under general anesthesia) as part of a research study for patients with the Dravet syndrome.1 MRI of the left foot was performed at the same time.
Dr. Teresa Victoria: MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse cerebral volume loss. There were incidental secretions filling the sphenoid and frontal sinuses that had heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted images and hyperintense signal intensity on T1-weighted images; mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses was also noted. MRI of the left foot, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal bone marrow edema in the midfoot and hindfoot. There was no fracture, dislocation, or joint effusion.
Dr. Lerner: Treatment with amoxicillin was initiated by the patient’s primary care physician to treat possible sinusitis. Seven days before this admission, the patient’s parents noticed increased swelling and new warmth of the left foot, and the patient appeared uncomfortable when bearing weight on that foot. The oral temperature measured at home was 38.3°C. Five days before this admission, bruising of the left foot developed, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.
On evaluation, the patient was afebrile and appeared well. There was swelling, bruising, and tenderness of the left foot. The white-cell count was 5870 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the hemoglobin level 11.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the blood level of C-reactive protein (CRP) 23.9 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Victoria: Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed minimally displaced fractures at the base of the second metatarsal and the cuboid, as well as diffuse bone demineralization.
FIGURE 1

Radiographs of the Left Foot.
Dr. Lerner: A walking cast was placed, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 5 days, his parents noticed that he was less interactive than usual. He had intermittent diaphoresis and tachycardia, and the frequency of seizures had increased from one every 2 to 3 days to two or three seizures daily. One day before this admission, the oral temperature measured at home was 38.1°C. After a telephone consultation with the patient’s primary care physician, treatment with amoxicillin was changed to amoxicillin–clavulanate. The seizure frequency did not decrease, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.
Additional history was obtained from the patient’s parents. They had not observed nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or cough. The patient had gingivitis that had recently worsened; during the 2 weeks before this admission, there had been new bleeding from the gums and bleeding from the nose. The patient was following a ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment for seizures; because of multiple food allergies, the ketogenic formula was administered through a gastrostomy tube. He had loose stools, which the parents attributed to tube feeding; the stools were unchanged in volume and frequency. He had had two episodes of nonbilious, nonbloody emesis during the week before this admission.
The patient’s parents also reported that 7 months before this admission, the patient had begun to have fever, vomiting, and increased volume and frequency of stools; coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was diagnosed, and the volume of the ketogenic formula was decreased by half for 4 days until vomiting resolved. Medications included amoxicillin–clavulanate, cannabidiol, clobazam, famotidine, glycopyrrolate, levocarnitine, levocetirizine, a multivitamin, potassium citrate, and phosphorus, as well as lorazepam as needed for seizures lasting longer than several minutes. He had no known drug allergies. He lived with his father and two cats in an urban area of New England; he occasionally stayed with his mother in a rural area of New England.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8°C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the blood pressure 124/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.8. The patient appeared tired and flushed but was alert and interactive. There was low muscular bulk and tone. The gingivae were erythematous and bleeding (Figure 2), and several dental caries were seen. There was no sinus tenderness or discharge. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the heart sounds were normal. The abdomen was nontender, and the insertion site of the gastrostomy tube was not erythematous or indurated. The walking cast was removed; there was edema and bruising of the left foot (Figure 2).
FIGURE 2

Clinical Photographs.
The results of tests of liver function and kidney function were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes and glucose. Urinalysis was normal; there were 2+ ketones (reference value, negative; however, 2+ is considered to be a normal value for patients following a therapeutic ketogenic diet). The blood level of CRP had increased to 74.0 mg per liter; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was negative. Stool testing for Clostridium difficile antigen and toxin was negative, as was a stool examination for ova and parasites. Specimens of blood and stool were sent for culture. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest revealed a patchy opacity in the right lung base. Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed diffuse bone demineralization and fractures of the second metatarsal and cuboid, findings that were similar to those seen on previous imaging. There was sclerosis in the proximal first and distal fourth and fifth metatarsals that was suggestive of new fractures. A crescentic osseous fragment was thought to be an avulsed fragment of bone.
Dr. Lerner: A diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made, treatment with intravenous fluids and ampicillin–sulbactam was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 7 days, he had no fever, but tachycardia persisted. Blood cultures showed no growth, and stool cultures showed normal intestinal flora. The CRP level had increased to 108.1 mg per liter, the d-dimer level was 6953 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500), and the hemoglobin level had decreased to 7.0 g per deciliter. Additional imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Victoria: Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed multiple new areas of cortical erosions, including the medial base of the first metatarsal and the medial navicular bone. MRI of the left tibia, fibula, and foot (Figure 3), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed worsening bone edema in the left foot; foci of bone edema were also seen in the proximal tibia and fibula. Multiple fractures that had been seen on previous imaging of the left foot were noted, and there were intraosseous cystic hemorrhagic foci within the calcaneal, cuboid, and second metatarsal fractures.
FIGURE 3

MRI of the Left Foot.
Dr. Lerner: On hospital day 8, the temporal temperature was 38.0°C. New nontender, purpuric macules were present on the fingers, hands (Figure 2), arms, and toes.
A diagnostic test was performed.","Multiple vitamin deficiencies, including vitamin C deficiency."
Case 24-2023: A 43-Year-Old Man with a Pulmonary Nodule,"Dr. Margo A. Peyton (Medicine): A 43-year-old man was evaluated in the multidisciplinary Pulmonary Nodule Clinic of this hospital because of an incidentally found pulmonary nodule.
One month before the current evaluation, the patient, who lived in Panama, was seen at a primary care clinic in Colombia for a routine annual physical examination. He was in his usual state of good health, but because of a family history of cancer, he requested that imaging studies be obtained.
Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography (CT) of the neck, chest, and abdomen (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a pulmonary nodule (measuring 12 mm by 13 mm) in the right middle lobe.
FIGURE 1

Chest CT.
Dr. Peyton: During the next month, follow-up testing was performed. The 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid level in a 24-hour urine specimen and the chromogranin A level in blood were reportedly normal, as were the results of pulmonary function testing and colonoscopy.
Dr. Shepard: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)–positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT (Figure 2) revealed FDG uptake in the right-middle-lobe nodule (measuring 14 mm in diameter), with a maximum standardized uptake value of 3.8. There was also FDG uptake in multiple normal-sized right inferior paratracheal, subcarinal, and hilar lymph nodes. A right hilar lymph node (measuring 8 mm in diameter) had a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.7.
FIGURE 2

PET Scan.
Dr. Peyton: The patient requested evaluation in the United States and was referred to the multidisciplinary Pulmonary Nodule Clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient felt well. He had no fever, shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, headache, vision changes, oral ulcers, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, arthralgias, or rash. He reported no recent illnesses.
The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Three years before this evaluation, chest radiography and abdominal ultrasonography, performed at his request because of a family history of cancer, had reportedly shown no abnormalities. The patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He worked in the finance industry and had previously been a health care worker. He was born in northern South America and had moved to southern Central America 5 years earlier. He lived in an urban area with his wife, son, and dog.
The patient had visited nearly every country in North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. Four years earlier, he had traveled by motorcycle from Alaska to Panama; 6 months earlier, he had traveled by motorcycle from Colombia to Chile. The patient had also traveled to several countries in western and eastern Europe, northern Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific Islands. He had a physically active lifestyle that included weight lifting and bicycling at least four times per week. He had smoked two cigarettes daily and one cigar every 3 months for 2 years. His family history of cancer included breast cancer in his mother, prostate and pancreatic cancers in his father, cancer of unknown primary origin in his maternal grandfather, and ovarian cancer in his paternal grandmother.
On evaluation, the temporal temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 133/82 mm Hg, the pulse 68 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.1. He appeared well, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. There was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The white-cell count was 6970 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the hemoglobin level 12.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the platelet count 213,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Results of kidney-function, liver-function, and coagulation tests were normal.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Histoplasmosis
Case 23-2023: A 21-Year-Old Man with Progressive Dyspnea,"Dr. Alison S. Witkin: A 21-year-old male college student was evaluated in the cardiology clinic at this hospital, before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, because of progressive dyspnea.
When the patient was in his early teens, he was evaluated for intermittent exertional dyspnea and received a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma. Montelukast and an albuterol inhaler were prescribed for use as needed; however, he had not used these medications in the 2 years before the current presentation.
Several months before the current presentation, the patient noticed increased dyspnea, which occurred when he was playing sports such as volleyball or walking on campus, specifically when walking at an incline or while carrying parcels. Friends had commented on his inability to “keep up” during games and while walking.
Six days before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated for dyspnea by his primary care physician at a hospital affiliated with this hospital. The heart rate was 71 beats per minute and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG), transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and chest radiograph were obtained.
Dr. David M. Dudzinski: An ECG (Figure 1A) showed right bundle-branch block and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. A TTE (Figure 1B and 1C) showed right ventricular enlargement with severe hypokinesia and hypertrophy (estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, 84 mm Hg), right atrial enlargement, flattening of the interventricular septum during systole and diastole, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and inferior vena cava dilatation.

Dr. Witkin: The patient was referred to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the heart rate was 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 130/82 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. The white-cell differential count and blood levels of calcium, amylase, lipase, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Echocardiography performed after the administration of agitated saline (a “bubble study”) did not reveal an atrial septal defect, but a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting was identified.

Dr. Shenoy-Bhangle: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material and in accordance with a pulmonary embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism. However, the main pulmonary artery was dilated (diameter, 39 mm; normal value, 29 in men and 27 in women), as were segmental pulmonary artery branches. The right ventricle was enlarged. Bilateral mild, diffuse, centrilobular ground-glass nodules were noted, along with interlobular septal thickening. A 45-mm area of coarse calcification was seen in the right lobe of the liver.
Dr. Witkin: The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital with a plan for follow-up the next morning in the cardiology clinic at this hospital. At the follow-up visit, the system review was notable for snoring (reported by his roommates) and dyspnea that occurred after he ascended three flights of stairs. He had no chest pain or pressure, edema, orthopnea, dyspnea at night, light-headedness, syncope, fever, recent illness, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, change in weight, jaundice, abdominal pain or distention, change in bowel habits, nausea, anorexia, hair or nail changes, or rash.
The patient’s medical history was notable for internal hemorrhoids with an episode of rectal bleeding, as well as a traumatic ankle sprain 3 years before the current presentation. He took no medications but had previously taken methylphenidate and atomoxetine for a learning disability characterized by inattention and difficulty with auditory processing. He took several supplements for calming and increased attention, which included the following ingredients: rhodiola extract, phosphatidylserine, melatonin, astaxanthin, and amino acids such as glutamate, glycine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, taurine, theanine, and tyrosine. He consumed protein shakes before workouts and had used creatine supplements 2 years earlier. He had received an influenza vaccine and all the routine immunizations that are required to attend school.
The patient was a student at a local college. During the current school year, he had been exercising at the gym three times per week, doing mostly isometric exercise and some aerobic exercise. He had never used cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, marijuana, or illicit substances. He lived with roommates, and there were no known allergic or environmental exposures in their apartment. His family history was notable for inflammatory bowel disease in his father, coronary artery disease in several paternal relatives, myocardial infarction in his maternal grandfather (when he was in his 70s), colon cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after long-term smoking in his maternal grandmother, and asthma in his maternal aunt. His two siblings were healthy.
On examination, the heart rate was 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg in the right arm and 122/72 mm Hg in the left arm, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was in the supine position and breathing ambient air, and the level decreased to 90% after he ascended two flights of stairs. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.6. The patient appeared to have normal development and was breathing comfortably. The sclerae were anicteric. The jugular venous pressure was 14 cm of water. A parasternal heave was detected. On auscultation, the lungs were clear, the P2 heart sound was accentuated, and a grade 3/6 early systolic murmur was present at the left sternal border. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Clubbing of the fingers and toes was present, without cyanosis.
An ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute, right bundle-branch block, and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. Blood levels of thyrotropin and glycated hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Additional tests were performed the next day. Spirometry showed normal lung volumes and a reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO; 71% of the predicted value). A bronchodilator test showed no clinically significant response to an inhaled bronchodilator. Right heart catheterization revealed a right atrial pressure of 6 mm Hg, a right ventricular pressure of 90/7 mm Hg, a pulmonary arterial pressure of 89/28 mm Hg (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 57 mm Hg), and a pulmonary arterial wedge pressure of 8 mm Hg. The central venous oxygen saturation was 67% (reference range, 60 to 70), the mixed venous oxygen saturation 71% (reference range, 65 to 75), and the arterial oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The cardiac output, measured by means of thermodilution, was 6.2 liters per minute. The pulmonary vascular resistance was approximately 8 Wood units. After the patient inhaled 30 ppm of nitric oxide, the mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 52 mm Hg and the cardiac output 6.0 liters per minute.
A diagnosis was made.",Congenital absence of the main portal vein with a congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (Abernethy malformation).
Case 22-2023: A 59-Year-Old Woman with Hypotension and Electrocardiographic Changes,"Dr. Yuefan Chen (Anesthesia, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine): A 59-year-old woman had hypotension and electrocardiographic (ECG) ST-segment abnormalities after the administration of anesthetic agents while she was in the operating room of this hospital.
Eighteen weeks before the current presentation, features of acromegaly were observed on routine physical examination by the patient’s primary care provider at another hospital. The blood level of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) was 595 ng per milliliter (reference range, 50 to 317) and the growth hormone level 9.1 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 7.1). The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital.
Eleven weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic. She reported that her shoe size, which had been stable since young adulthood, had recently increased by two sizes. She also reported a deepening of her voice, fatigue, headaches, arthralgias, oily skin, skin tags, and acne on her face and back. She had had an intentional weight loss of 12.7 kg during the previous 9 months. The facial features were coarse, and there was no frontal bossing. Visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The tongue was thick and obscured the soft palate; the lower jaw was enlarged, with increased spacing between the teeth. The hands and feet were large and fleshy. Scattered skin tags were present on the neck. Auscultation of the heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a normal-sized pituitary gland with a well-circumscribed area of hypoenhancement that measured 9 mm by 7 mm by 10 mm. The patient was referred to the neurosurgery clinic of this hospital, and an elective microscopic transsphenoidal hypophysectomy was subsequently recommended.
Seven weeks before the current presentation, an extensive preoperative evaluation was performed, given the patient’s diagnosis of acromegaly. As part of the preoperative evaluation, additional history was obtained. The patient’s medical history included hypertension, prediabetes, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, polycystic ovary syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and scoliosis. Physical activity was limited by pain in the knees; she could climb a flight of stairs but did so very slowly because of knee pain. She had no chest pain or dyspnea. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan, and ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed for joint pain. Hydroxychloroquine had caused leukopenia, and meperidine had caused gastrointestinal upset. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her husband and worked in an office. She did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; she drank alcohol rarely. Multiple maternal and paternal family members had cardiovascular disease.
ECG revealed sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, including a T-wave inversion in lead III. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular volume and systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, and there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal; the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 28 mm Hg. Mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation were present. A pharmacologic stress test, with myocardial perfusion imaging performed after the administration of regadenoson, revealed no evidence of ischemia.
Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was taken to the operating room for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. The preoperative temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 131/69 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 35.7. Midazolam was administered, and anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, propofol, lidocaine, and rocuronium. Tracheal intubation was moderately challenging because of the presence of redundant tissue in the supraglottic region. During intubation, the oxygen saturation decreased to 79% but normalized in less than 1 minute. Inhaled sevoflurane (an anesthetic) and dexamethasone and piperacillin–tazobactam were administered, remifentanil and phenylephrine infusions were started, and the patient was placed in a level, supine position for the procedure.
After the induction of anesthesia, before the surgical procedure was initiated, the blood pressure gradually decreased (Figure 1A). Sixteen minutes after induction began, the blood pressure was 96/48 mm Hg and the heart rate 75 beats per minute; 29 minutes after induction began, the blood pressure had decreased to 67/36 mm Hg and the heart rate to 71 beats per minute. Telemetric monitoring (Figure 2A) showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads and ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads. Aspirin was administered rectally, the rate of the phenylephrine infusion was increased, and multiple boluses of phenylephrine and an ephedrine bolus were administered. The blood pressure increased to 110/54 mm Hg and the heart rate to 111 beats per minute. Telemetric monitoring showed resolution of the ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Findings on ECG and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) performed in the operating room were consistent with those of the preoperative ECG and TTE. The procedure was aborted, the patient was weaned from the vasopressor therapies, and the trachea was extubated. She was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit.
FIGURE 1

Intraoperative Vital Signs.
FIGURE 2

Intraoperative Telemetric Monitoring.
On admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, the blood level of troponin T was 10 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 9); 1 hour later, the level had decreased to 8 ng per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography was normal. Computed tomographic angiography of the coronary arteries revealed moderate stenosis of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery. The intraoperative ST-segment elevations were attributed to coronary vasospasm. Treatment with amlodipine and isosorbide mononitrate was initiated for coronary vasospasm, and treatment with atorvastatin was started for nonobstructive coronary artery disease. After discussion among the cardiology, neurosurgery, and anesthesia teams, it was determined that the patient remained a candidate for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, particularly because the surgery could offer a cure for her acromegaly; the procedure was rescheduled. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day.

During the subsequent 3 weeks, the patient continued taking the newly prescribed medications, and no new symptoms developed. On the day of the current presentation, she was again taken to the operating room to undergo transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. The preoperative blood pressure, as measured through an arterial catheter, was 118/67 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. Sedation with fentanyl and midazolam was started, topical lidocaine was used to anesthetize the airways, and fiberoptic tracheal intubation was performed while the patient was awake. Anesthesia was then induced with propofol, rocuronium, and sevoflurane. A phenylephrine infusion was started, and piperacillin–tazobactam was administered.
The blood pressure decreased abruptly to 54/29 mm Hg (Figure 1B). Telemetric monitoring (Figure 2B) showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads and ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads.
Management decisions were made, and a diagnostic test was performed.",Kounis syndrome due to exposure to piperacillin–tazobactam.
Case 21-2023: A 61-Year-Old Man with Eyelid Swelling,"Dr. Jonathan E. Lu (Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear): A 61-year-old man was evaluated in an ophthalmology clinic affiliated with this hospital because of eyelid swelling.
Eight years before the current presentation, the patient noticed mild puffiness of the eyelids that was worst in the morning and typically resolved by midday. Five years before the current presentation, the eyelid swelling began to progressively worsen and to last throughout the day. The patient had a history of glaucoma; when the eyelid swelling began to interfere with his vision, he asked for a consultation with the ophthalmologist who had treated his glaucoma. A diagnosis of dermatochalasis with fat prolapse was suspected, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery clinic affiliated with this hospital for consideration of blepharoplasty.
In the clinic, the patient reported that eyelid puffiness was interfering with his ability to read and drive. He did not have dry eye. He had a sensation of pressure behind the eyes and intermittent double vision. There was generalized joint stiffness in the mornings that resolved after 1 hour. There was left lateral hip pain that radiated to the left buttock and thigh, with associated paresthesia in the left foot.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection had been diagnosed 31 years before the current presentation and was well controlled with antiretroviral therapy, although lipodystrophy had occurred with treatment. Other medical history included carpal tunnel syndrome, cataracts, depression, dyslipidemia, hypertension, allergic rhinitis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma, in addition to primary open-angle glaucoma. Surgical history included carpal tunnel release surgery (performed 2 months before the current presentation), intraocular lens replacement in both eyes, and lipectomy for the reduction of dorsocervical lipohypertrophy due to lipodystrophy. Medications included antiretroviral therapy (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide), bupropion, fluoxetine, triamterene, amlodipine, atorvastatin, inhaled albuterol, and topical testosterone. The administration of iodinated contrast material had caused hives. The patient lived part time in Florida and part time in New England. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit substances.
On examination, the corrected visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light. Confrontation testing revealed deficits in the outer superior temporal visual fields and the superior nasal visual fields, which abated with manual elevation of the eyelids. Supraduction and abduction were limited in both eyes. Soft edema of the upper and lower eyelids was present, along with mild erythema of the upper eyelids (Figure 1). The upper-eyelid skin was overhanging the lashes medially, a finding indicative of dermatochalasis. There was upper-eyelid ptosis. The globes were moderately resistant to retropulsion, and there was mild proptosis. The levator palpebrae superioris muscles had impaired function, with an eyelid elevation of 8 mm in the right eye and 11 mm in the left eye (reference range, 12 to 18). Slit-lamp examination revealed 1+ chemosis and trace injection in the conjunctivae; there was no evidence of superficial punctate keratopathy or cells in the anterior chambers. Funduscopic examination revealed an increased cup-to-disk ratio in the optic nerves, a finding consistent with the patient’s known history of glaucoma. The tongue was enlarged, and there was dorsocervical lipohypertrophy on the posterior aspect of the neck.
FIGURE 1

Clinical Photographs at Presentation.
The blood levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins were normal. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Laura V. Romo: Computed tomography (CT) of the face and orbits (Figure 2A and 2B), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral enlargement of the extraocular muscles and fat stranding in the orbits and elsewhere in the face. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the face and orbits (Figure 2C through 2F), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed orbital fat stranding and mild, symmetric, diffuse extraocular-muscle enlargement. A short-tau inversion recovery sequence showed an increased signal that spared the myotendinous junctions. Diffuse thickening and stranding of the skin on the preseptal eyelids and face, episcleritis along the posterior margin of both globes, and perineuritis around the optic nerves were also noted.
FIGURE 2

Imaging Studies of the Face and Orbits.
Dr. Lu: The blood levels of glucose and electrolytes and the results of kidney-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), lysozyme, rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 22 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). The blood IgG level was 1980 mg per deciliter (reference range, 767 to 1590), the IgG1 level 283 mg per deciliter (reference range, 341 to 894), and the IgG2 level 1750 mg per deciliter (reference range, 171 to 632); the blood IgG3 and IgG4 levels were normal. Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) was negative, including an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase. A rapid plasma reagin test was nonreactive. An interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infection was negative.
A diagnostic procedure was performed.",Systemic immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis.
Case 20-2023: A 52-Year-Old Man with a Solitary Fibrous Tumor and Hypoglycemia,"Dr. Gregory M. Cote: A 52-year-old man with a metastatic solitary fibrous tumor was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 1.5 years before the current admission, when dysuria and pain in the lower abdomen and left leg developed after a motor vehicle accident. At another hospital, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reportedly revealed an incidental 14-cm necrotic mass in the pelvis, anterior to the bladder. Biopsy of the mass was reportedly diagnostic of a solitary fibrous tumor.
The patient was referred to the multidisciplinary oncology clinic of this hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed for staging, revealed two 9-mm nodules in the left lung. The patient was treated with a 3-month course of dacarbazine chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy targeting the pelvic mass, and then he underwent surgical resection of the pelvic tumor, including partial cystectomy and placement of a ureteral stent. Pathological examination of the resected specimen (Figure 1) confirmed the diagnosis of spindle-cell sarcoma with features consistent with a dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumor. Immunohistochemical staining of the resected specimen revealed signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and CD34 in the tumor cells. Stereotactic radiation therapy for the lung nodules was also administered.
FIGURE 1

Specimen of the Resected Mass.
However, metastatic disease progressed in the lungs, chest, bladder, and right leg. Over the subsequent 12-month period, the patient underwent serial treatment with four different chemotherapeutic regimens: pazopanib, doxorubicin with olaratumab, gemcitabine with docetaxel, and vinorelbine. Palliative radiation therapy for a painful leg metastasis was also provided.
Eleven days after the initiation of vinorelbine chemotherapy and 30 days before the current admission, the patient was admitted to this hospital with fever (temperature, 38.3°C), neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, 770 per microliter; reference range, 1800 to 7700), and pneumonia in the left lower lobe.
Dr. Reece J. Goiffon: CT of the chest and abdomen (Figure 2A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed known metastatic involvement of the lungs, bladder, retroperitoneum, peritoneum, skeletal muscles, and subcutaneous fat. There was no metastatic involvement of the adrenal glands, pancreas, or liver.
FIGURE 2

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Cote: Empirical treatment with cefepime was administered. Over the next several days, the neutropenia and fever resolved and the pneumonia abated. On the seventh hospital day, the patient was discharged home with a follow-up visit scheduled in the oncology clinic.
Eleven days after hospital discharge and 12 days before the current admission, the patient attended a scheduled outpatient visit for an infusion. He reported weakness and appeared confused. A fingerstick glucose level was 47 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter). Supplemental oral and intravenous glucose was administered, and his mental status improved, but fingerstick glucose levels remained below 70 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter). Review of fingerstick glucose measurements obtained during the patient’s recent hospitalization showed multiple levels ranging from 50 to 60 mg per deciliter (2.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter).
The patient was admitted to the oncology unit of this hospital for the management of hypoglycemia. Laboratory test results from the second hospital admission are shown in Table 1. While the patient was in the hospital, he began to have diaphoresis that correlated with episodes of hypoglycemia, for which he received orange juice and dextrose. On evaluation by a dietitian, he was found to be meeting anticipated caloric requirements. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day; the blood glucose level was 55 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter) before discharge.

Three days later and 6 days before the current admission, the patient attended the scheduled follow-up visit in the oncology clinic. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with trabectedin was initiated, along with pegfilgrastim and a 3-day tapering course of dexamethasone. The day after the dexamethasone course was completed, the patient reported increased fatigue and cough. Two days later, he was admitted to the oncology unit because of weakness and diaphoresis; a fingerstick glucose level was 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter).
On the current admission, review of systems was notable for fatigue; pain associated with tumors involving the back, shoulders, and right leg; numbness of the right leg; the use of an indwelling Foley catheter for 2 months owing to urinary retention; dull chest pain and intermittent dyspnea that had persisted for 4 months; and constipation. The patient had no recent anorexia, weight change, fever, chills, orthopnea, hemoptysis, light-headedness, dizziness, palpitations, syncope, nausea, or vomiting.
The patient’s medical history was notable for transfusion-dependent anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (for which he had received metformin, although not in the previous 6 months), hypertension, a colonic tubular adenoma, a renal cyst, osteoarthritis, chronic low-back pain, and depression. He had undergone an appendectomy in the remote past. Medications included oral gabapentin, cyanocobalamin, tamsulosin, and finasteride; transdermal fentanyl; and oral acetaminophen, clonazepam, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and oxycodone as needed. He had no access to insulin or other hypoglycemic medications. There were no known adverse drug reactions.
The patient had formerly worked as a laborer and had been receiving disability benefits since the motor vehicle accident. He had previously consumed six beers per week and smoked one pack of cigarettes per day, but he had stopped drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco 1 year earlier. There was no history of other substance use. His family history of cancer included melanoma in his father, thyroid cancer in his sister, ovarian cancer in his maternal grandmother, leukemia in his maternal aunt, and sarcoma in his paternal uncle. His mother had hypertension and dyslipidemia, and a brother had diabetes. The patient had an adult child, who was healthy.
The tympanic temperature was 37.0°C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Multiple tender, palpable masses were present, including masses on the left shoulder, neck, and left upper leg. A venous-access port was in place in the chest wall on the right side. The abdominal incision was well healed. A Foley catheter was in place, and there was pink-tinged urine. A faint rash was present on the lower abdomen at the site of previous radiation therapy. Edema was present in both legs. Laboratory test results from the current hospital admission are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Goiffon: A chest radiograph (Figure 2B) showed abundant metastatic pulmonary nodules. CT of the chest (Figure 2C and 2D), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed that the nodules had increased in size and quantity over a period of 1 month. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Dr. Cote: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, a leftward axis, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and intraventricular conduction delay.
On the first hospital day, although the patient was receiving a continuous infusion of dextrose, five bolus injections of dextrose and six glasses of orange juice were needed to increase the blood glucose level to more than 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter). On the morning of the second hospital day, the blood glucose level was 42 mg per deciliter (2.3 mmol per liter). Treatment with oral prednisone was initiated.
A diagnosis was made.",Doege–Potter syndrome.
Case 19-2023: An 80-Year-Old Man with Left Foot Drop,"Dr. Joshua U. Okonkwo (Neurology): An 80-year-old man was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of left foot drop.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 5 years before the current presentation, when he first noticed that he needed to lift up his left leg while walking in order to prevent the toes of his left foot from dragging on the ground. During the next 2 years, his ability to dorsiflex the left ankle decreased progressively. Three years before this presentation, he began to use an ankle–foot orthosis.
One year before this presentation, the patient was evaluated in a neurology clinic affiliated with another hospital. He reported left foot drop, as well as occasional falls that he attributed to poor balance. Examination reportedly revealed wasting in the muscles below the left knee, weakness with attempts at dorsiflexion and eversion of the left ankle, loss of pinprick sensation to the midshins in both legs, and decreased vibratory sensation in the toes of both feet. The blood levels of cobalamin, folate, thyrotropin, and glycated hemoglobin and the results of serum protein electrophoresis were reportedly normal. Tests for syphilis and antinuclear antibodies were negative, as were blood tests for antibodies to sulfate-3-glucuronyl paragloboside and myelin-associated glycoprotein and a serum paraneoplastic autoantibody panel. The blood creatine kinase level was 456 IU per liter (reference range, 30 to 194) and the aldolase level 5.8 U per liter (reference value, <8.1). Imaging studies were obtained.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was reportedly normal. MRI of the lumbar spine reportedly revealed diffuse disk bulging with facet hypertrophy at multiple levels, which was contributing to mild spinal stenosis. Needle electromyography (EMG) of the left leg reportedly showed changes consistent with moderate-to-severe, subacute-to-chronic radiculopathy at L5 and S1 on the left side.
The patient declined further workup at that time. One year later, his symptoms had not resolved, and he presented to the neurology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.
On the current evaluation, the patient reported stable left foot drop and mild low-back pain without radiating symptoms. He had no bowel or bladder changes, no double vision or hearing changes, and no difficulty with breathing, chewing, or swallowing. His medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, and adenocarcinoma of the prostate, which had been treated with local radiation therapy 4 years before this presentation. Medications included aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, metoprolol, and simvastatin. The patient was married, resided in New England, and was retired from work in the insurance industry. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit smoking 30 years before this presentation. He drank four alcoholic drinks per day. His sister had breast cancer, and his father had died in his 70s from esophageal cancer.
On examination, the blood pressure was 140/60 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.1. He had a steppage gait pattern with prominent left foot drop. He could not walk on his left heel, but he was able to walk on his left toes and to walk with a tandem gait.
There was mild facial weakness, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side, with an asymmetric smile and weak eye closure and cheek puffing. The optic disks had sharp margins. The pupils were round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were full. There was no weakness or atrophy of the jaw, palate, or tongue. Hearing was grossly intact. Shoulder shrug was asymmetric, with less rise on the right side. A motor examination revealed wasting of the shoulder girdle, which was more prominent on the right side, and wasting of the calves. Tone was mildly decreased throughout, and there were no fasciculations. There was severe scapular winging, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side. There was no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia.
Strength was assessed according to the Medical Research Council scale, which ranges from 0 (no visible muscle contraction) to 5 (normal strength). On the right and left sides, strength was 4 and 4+, respectively, on shoulder abduction; 5 and 3 on ankle dorsiflexion; 4+ and 4 on big-toe extension; 5 and 4+ on ankle inversion; and 5 and 4− on ankle eversion. On both sides, strength was 4+ on hip flexion and was normal on neck flexion and extension, elbow flexion and extension, wrist flexion and extension, finger extension and abduction, thumb abduction, hip abduction, knee flexion and extension, and plantar flexion. Deep-tendon reflexes were 1+ at the biceps, 1+ at the triceps, trace at the brachioradialis, 2+ at the knees, and not elicited at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor. There was loss of pinprick and temperature sensations to the midshins in both legs, as well as decreased vibratory sensation to the ankles. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Karen A. Buch: MRI of the lumbar spine (Figure 1) revealed a large, leftward, eccentric disk herniation at L5 and S1 that impinged on the exiting L5 nerve roots, with greater impingement on the left side than on the right side. There was narrowing of the left subarticular zone and left lateral recess that encroached on the descending left S1 nerve root. Facet hypertrophy and ligamentous infolding at multiple levels were contributing to mild central spinal stenosis.

Dr. Okonkwo: Additional testing was performed, and a diagnosis was made.",Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.
Case 18-2023: A 19-Year-Old Woman with Dyspnea and Tachypnea,"Dr. Jacquelyn M. Nestor (Medicine): A 19-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of respiratory failure.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 weeks before the current presentation, when pain developed in the right shoulder and the right flank. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital and was discharged home after testing for kidney stones and appendicitis was reportedly negative.
Two weeks before the current presentation, dyspnea with exertion and nonproductive cough developed. Six days after the onset of dyspnea and cough, the patient departed on a vacation cruise with her family. During the 8-day trip, dyspnea and cough worsened and prevented her from participating in activities such as swimming and hiking. By the end of the cruise, she had severe dyspnea with walking, and she required the use of a wheelchair during her trip home. After returning to Massachusetts, she presented to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation.
The patient reported ongoing cough and progressively worsening dyspnea but no chest pain or hemoptysis. The temporal temperature was 37.1°C, the heart rate 132 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/47 mm Hg, the respiratory rate more than 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while she was breathing ambient air. She appeared ill and had increased work of breathing. A murmur was heard on cardiac examination; other details of the examination are not available. An electrocardiogram (ECG) reportedly showed sinus tachycardia and lateral and precordial T-wave inversions. Urinalysis results and blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; the blood level of N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 24,913 pg per milliliter (reference range, 5 to 125). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material according to a pulmonary embolism protocol, reportedly revealed pericardial and pleural effusions and multifocal lung opacities but no evidence of pulmonary emboli. Point-of-care ultrasonography reportedly revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, marked aortic regurgitation, and a possible aortic-root abscess. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula. Treatment with intravenous furosemide, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin was started. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit of this hospital.
On arrival at the cardiac intensive care unit, the patient received bilevel positive airway pressure. A family member accompanying the patient provided additional history. The patient had had intermittent back pain beginning 6 months before the current presentation. Two months before the current presentation, she had had asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Five weeks before the current presentation, she had had a dental cleaning. During the cruise, the patient had two episodes of diarrhea without fever or chills; the family member did not know whether other persons on the cruise had been ill. The patient had told her family that she had noticed visible pulsations in her chest during the 2 weeks before the current presentation, and the family member reported that the patient’s breathing had appeared labored while she was sleeping.
Other medical history included anxiety and anemia. The patient took supplemental iron and had no known drug allergies. She did not use alcohol, tobacco, or other substances. She lived with her family in Massachusetts and worked in child care. There was no family history of cardiac or autoimmune disease.
The temporal temperature was 36.8°C, the heart rate 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure 145/58 mm Hg in the right arm and 136/65 mm Hg in the left arm, the respiratory rate 48 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving bilevel positive airway pressure (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.70). The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. While the patient was sitting in an upright position, she had increased work of breathing and intermittent cough. The heart rhythm was tachycardic, with a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the base and a grade 3/4 decrescendo diastolic murmur at the base that radiated to the apex, without an S3 gallop. Carotid and subclavian bruits were present. The jugular venous pressure was 8 cm of water. There were rales and decreased breath sounds in both lungs. Brachial, ulnar, radial, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses were symmetric. The remainder of the examination was normal.
The blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, thyrotropin, lipase, human chorionic gonadotropin, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of liver function and kidney function. A urine toxicology screening test was negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 77 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the blood level of C-reactive protein was 147.8 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Tests for SARS-CoV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative.
Dr. Eric M. Isselbacher: An ECG (Figure 1A) showed sinus tachycardia, a borderline rightward axis, poor R-wave progression in leads V1 through V4, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 1B through 1F and Videos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 34%. The aortic valve was tricuspid, without evidence of vegetation or aortic-root abscess, but there was incomplete closure of the aortic valve, which resulted in severe aortic regurgitation. The ascending thoracic aorta was dilated, measuring 44 mm in diameter, with thickened walls. The dilated left ventricle caused tethering of the mitral valve, which resulted in mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation and mild left atrial enlargement. There was a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of cardiac tamponade.
FIGURE 1

Cardiac Studies.
Dr. Vinit Baliyan: CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 2) showed an irregular aortic contour with narrowing of the lumen in the vessels of the aortic arch and in the right renal artery. This imaging was performed with ECG gating, which allowed for the assessment of the aortic root. There was no evidence of a perivalvular abscess. However, circumferential wall thickening was present in the aorta at the root and in the ascending segment. In addition, there was circumferential wall thickening in partially visualized proximal vessels of the aortic arch and in the abdominal aorta. The mural thickening of the aorta showed enhancement that was suggestive of active inflammation; this enhancement was most visible in the abdominal aorta. Other findings included cardiomegaly with a markedly dilated left ventricle, alveolar pulmonary edema, a small pericardial effusion, and bilateral small pleural effusions.

"Case 17-2023: A 58-Year-Old Woman with Fatigue, Abdominal Bloating, and Eosinophilia","Dr. Rachel M. Erdil (Medicine): A 58-year-old woman was evaluated in the infectious disease clinic of this hospital because of fatigue, abdominal bloating, and eosinophilia.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 8 months before the current evaluation, when she fell and injured her right leg while hiking in a rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Before this injury, she had been traveling throughout the DRC for 1 month. She had hiked, walked barefoot, and gone swimming in freshwater lakes and rivers.
Approximately 55 hours after the fall, the patient was transported to the trauma center of a regional hospital. Imaging studies revealed fractures of the right tibia with associated hemorrhage. Packed red cells were transfused, and an external fixation device was placed. Once the patient’s condition was stable, she was transferred to a hospital in the United States.
At the second hospital, the eosinophil count was 3530 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 400); the eosinophil count had been normal 18 months earlier. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. One week after the fall, open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture was performed. The patient started physical therapy and was discharged home.

The patient had persistent weight gain and mild fatigue, which had developed 4 years before the current presentation. She had associated these symptoms with the onset of menopause. However, after the traumatic leg injury, she noticed that the symptoms increased in severity. One month before the current evaluation, the patient’s weight had increased by 8.6 kg since the leg injury, and she took a 1-hour nap every afternoon because of fatigue. In addition, she had new abdominal bloating that did not abate with the use of probiotics. The patient sought evaluation at a clinic associated with the second hospital. On evaluation, the results of blood tests for thyroid, kidney, and liver function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes. A test for Lyme disease was negative. The results of testing for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)–specific antibodies and other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient moved to New England and established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. She continued to receive physical therapy for rehabilitation of the right leg. She reported that the weight gain, fatigue, and abdominal bloating had worsened at a rapid rate; her weight had increased by 13.6 kg since the leg injury. The patient was referred to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital.
The patient had a history of chronic migraines and hyperlipidemia. Review of systems was notable for mild cough and swelling of the right knee that began after the surgery. She had no fever, hot flashes, night sweats, headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myalgias, arthralgias, or rash.
Current medications included levothyroxine and probiotics. There were no known allergies. The patient had previously traveled to the southwestern United States, North and East Africa, western Europe, and South and Southeast Asia. She currently lived in a suburban area of New England with her husband and cats in a house that had mold. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.
On examination, the temperature was 36.1°C, the blood pressure 98/66 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.9. She appeared well. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the abdomen was soft and nontender; there was no hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The right knee and leg had healed surgical scars. The skin examination was normal.
The eosinophil count was 1760 per microliter. Tests for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and strongyloidiasis were negative. The urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Vincent V. Dinculescu: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed calcified, nonenlarged subcarinal lymph nodes, along with calcified lesions in the right lung, liver, and spleen, findings suggestive of granulomatous disease. There was also a low-attenuation hepatic lesion measuring 1.6 cm in diameter, which was probably a cyst.

Case 16-2023: A 13-Year-Old Boy with Depression and Hypotension,"Dr. Abigail L. Donovan: A 13-year-old boy with a history of attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of worsening depression, thoughts of self-injurious behavior, and suicidality.
The patient had a history of impulsivity and frequent episodes of self-injury, such as head-butting and cutting, which sometimes occurred while he was in treatment settings. Twelve months before the current presentation, he began to have suicidal ideation, with occasional suicidal planning and a suicide attempt. During the next year, the patient had 10 evaluations in the emergency department and six inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations.
One day before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from an inpatient psychiatric hospital, where he had been admitted and treated for 3 weeks because of urges to hurt himself. On the day of the current presentation, the patient visited his middle school and participated in therapy at home. Throughout the day, he noticed worsening depression and had recurrent thoughts of self-injury and suicide. He asked his parents to call emergency medical services because he felt unsafe in his home. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.
On arrival, the patient was in an agitated and combative state, reporting that he had changed his mind and no longer wanted to be in the hospital. Attempts at verbal deescalation were not effective. Treatment with intramuscular olanzapine was administered, and physical restraints were placed on his arms and legs. During the next 6 hours, the agitation decreased, and the physical restraints were removed. Additional history was obtained but was limited because the patient shrugged his shoulders in response to most questions. He described the school visit as difficult and uncomfortable. He did not indicate why he felt unsafe in his home; he reported that he had picked at scabs on his arms and legs in order to hurt himself and had ongoing suicidal ideation. The patient also reported difficulty sleeping and concentrating, as well as loss of interest and motivation, although he still enjoyed playing sports. He had no homicidal ideation, paranoid thoughts, or delusions.
Medications included extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He lived in an urban area of New Hampshire with his mother, father, and sister.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 133/78 mm Hg, the heart rate 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared disheveled. There were scattered cuts and wounds in varying stages of healing on both arms. The patient was in a disengaged and agitated state. He had a depressed mood, a guarded affect, and difficulty concentrating. His speech was slow and soft, with reduced prosody. His thought process was logical and linear; the thought content was notable for suicidal ideation. He had no loosening of associations, delusions, or hallucinations. Insight and judgment were poor.
The patient was deemed to be at high risk for harm and was transferred to the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department. Transfer to an inpatient psychiatric hospital was requested, but no beds were available at any facility in the region. During the next 6 weeks, while the patient was awaiting admission to an inpatient psychiatric hospital, treatment with extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone was continued, and treatment with sertraline, diphenhydramine, and melatonin was initiated. He had frequent episodes of agitation, which led to the administration of oral clonidine or oral or intramuscular olanzapine as needed. He also had several episodes of self-injury; surveillance was heightened, with well-being checks performed every 15 minutes.
On day 41 in the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department, agitation developed, and a dose of oral olanzapine was administered in addition to scheduled medications. One hour later, agitation continued, and a dose of intramuscular olanzapine was administered. After the administration of intramuscular olanzapine, the temporal temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 119/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air.
The next morning, the blood pressure was 146/87 mm Hg and the heart rate 52 beats per minute. There were no new symptoms; the examination was unchanged. Twelve hours later, the blood pressure was 69/39 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. The patient reported malaise and lightheadedness with standing, as well as nausea and abdominal pain. He appeared pale, tired, and lethargic. Oral rehydration was encouraged. One hour later, the blood pressure was 94/50 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. Three hours after the onset of hypotension, the blood pressure was 79/45 mm Hg and the heart rate 85 beats per minute.
Blood and urine toxicologic screening was negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A blood specimen was obtained for culture. Intravenous fluids, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone were administered. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the pediatric medical service of this hospital.

Case 15-2023: A 33-Year-Old Man with Paresthesia of the Arms and Legs,"Dr. Priyanka Pullarkat (Medicine): A 33-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of progressively worsening paresthesia.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when he began to have an abnormal tingling sensation in the toes that he described as “pins and needles.” Over the course of several days, the paresthesia extended to the feet.
Six weeks before the current presentation, episodes of headache that lasted approximately 5 minutes and affected the left periorbital region began to occur on a daily basis. The headaches became less severe after the patient took acetaminophen. He had no associated nausea, vomiting, or neck pain.
Two weeks before the current presentation, paresthesia developed in the fingertips and, over the course of several days, extended to the hands and then the forearms. One week before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The temporal temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 134/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.9. He had no rash. Sensation to light touch and pinprick was absent from the toes to the midfoot.
Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C viruses, and Lyme disease were negative. The blood level of folate was greater than 20 ng per milliliter (45 nmol per liter; reference value, >4.6 ng per milliliter [>10 nmol per liter]), the vitamin B1 (thiamine) level 149.1 nmol per liter (reference range, 66.5 to 200), and the vitamin B12 (cobalamin) level 235 pg per milliliter (173 pmol per liter; reference range, 232 to 1245 pg per milliliter [171 to 919 pmol per liter]). Testing for anti–myelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies was negative. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Saurabh Rohatgi: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1) was performed. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, obtained before the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed mild, nonspecific, scattered foci of hyperintensity involving the supratentorial white matter; the dominant lesion, which was located in the right frontal centrum semiovale and corona radiata, measured 1.4 cm in diameter. No associated abnormal enhancement was seen on images obtained after the administration of contrast material.
FIGURE 1

MRI of the Head.
Dr. Pullarkat: The patient was referred to a neurology clinic. One week later, while the patient was awaiting an appointment in the neurology clinic, paresthesia extended into the thighs and torso. The patient was advised by his primary care physician to present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported worsening paresthesia and loss of dexterity in his hands. He was no longer able to play guitar. He had no motor weakness, bowel or bladder incontinence, or double vision. There was no change in sensation in his face or in articulation of his speech, and he had no dysphonia, dysphagia, or shortness of breath.
Other medical history included depression and chronic knee and ankle pain after trauma. Medications included bupropion and mirtazapine. There were no known allergies. The patient was a graduate student and lived with several roommates. He was sexually active with women. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 11 years before quitting 4 years before the current presentation. He had consumed three alcoholic drinks daily for many years, but 1 month before the current presentation, he had reduced consumption to two drinks one or two times per week. He used intranasal cocaine three or four times per week and inhaled nitrous oxide once per week. He had last used lysergic acid diethylamide and ketamine 10 weeks before the current presentation during a camping trip in rural New England; there were ticks in the area where he had camped, but he had not found any ticks on his body. The patient had a normal diet with no dietary restrictions, and there was no history of diarrhea or unintentional weight loss. His maternal grandfather had diabetes, and his paternal grandfather had gastric cancer.
The patient was alert and interactive and followed commands. The temporal temperature was 36.5°C, the blood pressure 131/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. He had a flat affect but was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. Muscle tone and strength were normal. In the legs, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the toes to the hips and flanks, with sparing of the anterior trunk and the back. In the arms, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the fingers to the shoulders. The reduced sensation was most pronounced in the fingers and toes. Vibratory sensation and proprioception were decreased below the shins. The reflexes were 2+ in the arms but were absent in the legs. The patient was able to touch the tip of his nose with his index finger when his eyes were open but was unable to do so when his eyes were closed. His gait was unsteady, and the Romberg test was positive.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Functional vitamin B12 deficiency from use of nitrous oxide.
Case 14-2023: A 31-Year-Old Man with Redness of the Right Eye,"Dr. Aaron R. Kaufman (Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear): A 31-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of redness of the right eye.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 days before the current evaluation, when he noticed an itchy perianal rash and rectal pain. After 2 days, the symptoms did not abate, and he sought evaluation in the urgent care clinic of this hospital.
On evaluation, the patient reported the perianal rash and gradually increasing rectal pain. He had been sexually active with two male partners in the previous month. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 117/84 mm Hg, and the pulse 80 beats per minute. Three scattered, tender, shallow ulcers and a vesicle were present in the perianal area. No rectal discharge or fissures were seen. Tender inguinal lymphadenopathy was present bilaterally; there was no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and orthopoxvirus infection were performed. Empirical treatment with valacyclovir was started. The patient was discharged home with instructions to await the test results.
Two days before the current evaluation, test results were available. The test for HIV types 1 and 2 was nonreactive, as were the tests of urinary and rectal specimens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acids. The blood test for treponemal antibodies was positive; the results of rapid plasma reagin (RPR) testing were not yet available. Polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of a swab specimen obtained from the perianal vesicle detected the presence of nonvariola orthopoxvirus DNA. Species-specific real-time PCR testing confirmed the presence of mpox virus (MPXV; formerly known as monkeypox virus), clade II. The patient was called and instructed to return to the emergency department of this hospital.
On evaluation, the patient reported a new rash on his chest, abdomen, and back that was similar to the perianal rash. He reported new fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, and headache. There was no weight loss, sore throat, or cough. Numerous scattered, tender, shallow ulcers were present on the chest, abdomen, and back, in addition to five tender, umbilicated pustules and one shallow ulcer in the perianal area (Figure 1). Treatment with tecovirimat was started. The patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up in the sexual health clinic of this hospital.
FIGURE 1

Photographs of the Skin.
During the next 2 days, the patient took tecovirimat. On the day of the current evaluation, he called the sexual health clinic because of redness and throbbing, pressurelike pain of the right eye. He was instructed to return to the emergency department of this hospital.
On the current evaluation, the patient reported that redness and discomfort of the right eye had started after he had been discharged from the emergency department and had increased in severity and become painful during the subsequent 2 days. He rated the pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He did not have blurry vision, photophobia, flashing lights, or floaters. There were no symptoms in the left eye. Since the initiation of antiviral therapy, the fever, chills, and headache had resolved, and the rectal pain had decreased in severity. There was no rhinorrhea or cough.
The patient had a history of syphilis, which had occurred 5 years earlier and had been treated with intramuscular penicillin G. Since receiving the diagnosis of mpox, he had learned that syphilis and mpox had been diagnosed in one of his sexual partners from the previous month. Medications included tecovirimat and valacyclovir. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England and worked in the food-service industry. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He did not know his family history.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4°C. The uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, without a relative afferent pupillary defect, and extraocular movements were full. The intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg in the right eye and 17 mm Hg in the left eye (normal range, 10 to 21). When proparacaine drops were administered to check the intraocular pressure, the pain in the right eye did not decrease in severity. There was mild tenderness on palpation of the right globe under the closed eyelid. Slit-lamp examination revealed mild meibomian-gland dysfunction in both eyes; there was no eyelid edema or erythema. The right conjunctiva was diffusely injected, with severe bulbar hyperemia (Figure 2A). The right caruncle was boggy and erythematous. On eversion of the eyelids, small-to-medium-sized follicles and tarsal conjunctival petechiae were observed on the right lower and upper lids (Figure 2B and 2C). The left conjunctiva was normal. The cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and lens appeared normal in both eyes. Dilated funduscopic examination was performed. The vitreous, optic nerve, retinal vasculature, macula, and periphery appeared normal in both eyes.

A diagnosis was made.",Mpox conjunctivitis.
Case 13-2023: A 25-Year-Old Woman with Abdominal Pain and Jerking Movements,"Dr. John C. Schell (Medicine): A 25-year-old woman with a history of acute intermittent porphyria was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and jerking movements of the right arm and leg.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 days before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed. She also felt confused and agitated, and a rash developed on her chest. One day before this admission, four episodes of jerking movements of the right arm and leg occurred, and the patient was concerned that she was having seizures. She presented to another hospital for evaluation.
At the other hospital, the patient reported that the symptoms were consistent with her previous flares of acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that jerking movements of the right arm and leg had occurred 5 minutes before her arrival at the hospital and had caused jaw dislocation; she also reported that the rash on her chest had become painful. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable. The mental-status and neurologic examinations were reportedly normal. The jaw was dislocated to the left, and there was diffuse abdominal tenderness. Intravenous morphine, diphenhydramine, and ondansetron were administered; an infusion of dextrose was started; and the dislocated jaw was manually reduced. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. The next day, the severity of pain in the abdomen and rash increased. Transfer to this hospital was requested because of a shortage of hemin at the other hospital.
On evaluation at this hospital, the patient described intense pain in the abdomen, a painful rash, and persistent nausea, agitation, and confusion. She was worried that she might have seizures, have blistering of the skin, or die because the hemin infusion had been delayed. Additional history was obtained from the patient. She had a history of obesity, anxiety, and chronic pain that had been attributed to acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that acute intermittent porphyria had been diagnosed 13 years before this admission, when abdominal pain, jerking movements of the right arm and leg, and a painful rash developed during menarche. During the 13 years before this admission, one or two flares of acute intermittent porphyria had occurred each year; during the 6 months before this admission, no flares had occurred.
Two previous flares of acute intermittent porphyria had been treated with a hemin infusion. During the first hemin infusion, the patient had a reaction that was characterized by intense yelling and writhing in pain, and intubation was performed to complete the infusion. Before the second hemin infusion, she received intravenous methylprednisolone and underwent elective intubation to prevent a reaction. The patient identified heat, stress, and menses as triggers for acute intermittent porphyria flares.
Medications included intravenous diphenhydramine and dextrose, which were administered daily through a central-venous-access port in the right side of the chest. The patient had previously taken intravenous morphine daily; however, she had not had access to this medication for approximately 3 months because of an inability to transport it from her home in the United Kingdom. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and penicillin had caused anaphylaxis, prochlorperazine had caused flushing, metoclopramide had caused anxiety, and fentanyl had caused altered mental status.
The patient was born in New England and had moved to the United Kingdom 15 years earlier. She was a student in a graduate program at a university in the United Kingdom and had returned to New England to visit her family. She did not use alcohol or illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke cigarettes. Her mother had dementia, and her father had died years earlier from an unknown cause. Her maternal grandmother had acute intermittent porphyria. Her immediate family had undergone genetic testing for acute intermittent porphyria; her brother was an asymptomatic carrier of a pathogenic variant, and her six other siblings were not carriers.
On examination, the temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 144/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared older than her stated age. She was awake, alert, and oriented. She was frustrated and irritable, with pressured speech. A port in the right side of the chest was palpated. Tenderness in the abdomen was diffuse but was worst in the right upper quadrant. Erythematous plaques and excoriations were present on the arms and chest and under the breasts. The neurologic examination was normal.
Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The hemoglobin level was 10.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0) and the platelet count 120,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). A urine specimen was obtained for measurement of the urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) and porphyrin levels, but the amount of urine was inadequate. Oral acetaminophen and intravenous morphine, diphenhydramine, lorazepam, and ondansetron were administered. Infusions of dextrose and hemin were started, and the patient was admitted to this hospital.
During the subsequent 2 days, the hemin infusion was continued, but the patient’s symptoms did not abate. On the second hospital day, an additional urine specimen was obtained; the urinary PBG level was 0.3 μmol per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 1.3) and the uroporphyrin level 4 nmol per liter (reference range, 0 to 30). On the third hospital day, the patient reported worsening jerking movements of the right arm and leg, which she believed had caused jaw dislocation. On examination, the jaw was dislocated to the left. She did not cooperate with a manual reduction, and a surgical reduction of the jaw was performed.
A diagnosis was made.",Factitious disorder.
Case 12-2023: A 44-Year-Old Woman with Muscle Weakness and Myalgia,"Dr. Chidiebere D. Akusobi (Medicine): A 44-year-old woman was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of proximal muscle weakness and myalgia.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 years before the current presentation, when morning stiffness and pain developed in the small joints of both hands. Laboratory evaluation reportedly revealed elevated blood levels of anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies and rheumatoid factor, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed, but the patient chose not to begin specific therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Instead, she began taking selenium, cod-liver oil, and turmeric as home remedies for joint pain. Morning stiffness and joint pain resolved after 4 weeks.
Four years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was started after the occurrence of another episode of morning stiffness and pain in the small joints of the hands. Three years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was stopped after melasma developed. Treatment with methotrexate was initiated, but morning hand stiffness and pain recurred; methotrexate was replaced with leflunomide, and the symptoms in the hands subsequently decreased.
Six months before the current presentation, the patient began to have myalgia in the arms and thighs, as well as generalized fatigue. She had difficulty raising her arms above her head, and she could no longer independently brush her hair or apply makeup. Myalgia worsened with exercise and was worst at the end of the day. The patient reported episodes of tingling in the hands and feet, but she had no stiffness or pain in the small joints of her hands.
Three months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a local rheumatologist and laboratory testing was performed. The blood level of creatine kinase was 422 U per liter (reference range, 40 to 150) and the lactate dehydrogenase level 509 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected at a titer of 1:320 in a nuclear homogenous pattern, and anti–U1-ribonucleoprotein (U1-RNP) antibodies were present. The blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal, and testing for anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and anti-Smith antibodies was negative. Two months before the current presentation, treatment with azathioprine was started, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital.
In the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported ongoing myalgia and tingling in the hands and feet but had noticed an improvement in her ability to raise her arms above her head after starting treatment with azathioprine. Two weeks earlier, episodes of muscle spasms in the hands and fingers had developed; massage of the hands had been performed to relax the spasms.
The patient had a history of Graves’ disease, which had been complicated by ophthalmoplegia and had been treated with methimazole for 2 years, followed by radioactive iodine ablation 11 years before this presentation; hypothyroidism had developed after radioactive iodine ablation therapy. Other history included latent tuberculosis infection, which had been treated with a 3-month course of isoniazid and rifampin, and hypoparathyroidism that had developed 9 years before this presentation. Medications included azathioprine, levothyroxine, calcium supplements, and calcitriol; the patient was unsure of the formulation and dose of calcium supplementation. She lived outside the United States and traveled intermittently to Boston for specialized medical care. She lived with her mother and worked in information technology. She drank alcohol occasionally, smoked cigarettes, and used no illicit drugs. A sibling had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 145/70 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She had mild exophthalmos in both eyes. There was an area of hyperpigmentation on the face. The joints had a normal range of motion without tenderness on palpation; there was no synovitis. Neck flexion was mildly weak, as was hip flexion; strength was otherwise normal, as was sensation. There was no rash. The remainder of the examination was normal.
Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",Hypocalcemic myopathy due to hypoparathyroidism.
Case 11-2023: A 67-Year-Old Man with Mantle-Cell Lymphoma and Hypoxemia,"Dr. Samuel A. Hofacker (Medicine): A 67-year-old man was admitted to this hospital with hypoxemia.
Six years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated because of melena and anemia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed duodenal ulcers; biopsy of one of the ulcers revealed changes consistent with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a locally invasive mass in the head of the pancreas. A diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the duodenum was made, and treatment included chemotherapy, chemoradiation, and pancreaticoduodenectomy. Two months after the surgery, surveillance CT of the chest showed segmental pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe. Treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin was recommended, but the patient declined.
During the next 5 years, surveillance CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed every 6 months. Six months before the current presentation, CT of the abdomen showed a new mass in the sigmoid colon with associated nodularity and lymphadenopathy. Colonoscopy revealed two fungating, nonobstructing, medium-sized masses, one at the ileocecal valve and the other in the sigmoid colon. Biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of mantle-cell lymphoma was established. The patient was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital, and plans were made for treatment with chemotherapy. Five months before the current presentation, pain in the right leg developed after a long car trip. Ultrasonography of the right leg revealed distal deep-vein thrombosis, and treatment with apixaban was initiated.
Nine weeks before the current presentation, cycle 1 of rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP) chemotherapy was administered, along with filgrastim. In addition, the administration of acyclovir and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was started for prophylaxis; however, rash developed on the trunk after 1 week, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was replaced with atovaquone for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.
Six weeks before the current presentation, cycle 2 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was administered. Two days later, melena, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion developed. Laboratory testing revealed anemia (hematocrit, 26.8%; normal range, 41.0 to 53.0). The patient received 2 units of packed red cells, and fatigue and dyspnea resolved. Treatment with omeprazole was initiated. Four weeks before the current presentation, the administration of atovaquone was stopped because of the cost of the medication, and dapsone was started for prophylaxis against P. jirovecii pneumonia.
Three weeks before the current presentation, cycle 3 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was administered. Ultrasonography of the right leg revealed resolution of the distal deep-vein thrombosis, and treatment with apixaban was stopped. Two weeks before the current presentation, fatigue and dyspnea on exertion recurred, but melena did not. Laboratory testing again revealed anemia (hematocrit, 28.7%), and the patient received 1 unit of packed red cells; fatigue resolved, but dyspnea did not.
On the day of presentation, the patient was evaluated before the administration of cycle 4 of R-DHAP chemotherapy. He reported ongoing dyspnea on exertion but no cough, fever, chills, chest pain, or orthopnea. He had been having loose stools since the pancreaticoduodenectomy. Other medical history included hypertension and hereditary spherocytosis, which had been treated with splenectomy. Medications included acyclovir, dapsone, lisinopril, and omeprazole. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole had caused a rash; there were no other known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol rarely; he had smoked tobacco for 2 years but had quit 20 years before this presentation. He was divorced, lived alone in a suburb of Boston, and worked as a lawyer. His mother had had breast cancer.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 134/82 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 92% while the patient was at rest and breathing ambient air, 88 to 90% while he was walking and breathing ambient air, and 93% while he was at rest and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.4. The patient had tachypnea but no increased work of breathing. The lung sounds were normal, and the jugular venous pulse was not elevated. The legs had no edema.
The blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of coagulation, kidney-function, and liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA was negative, as was a respiratory viral panel. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm.

Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: CT pulmonary angiography of the chest (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed filling defects in the right upper lobe and both lower lobes, findings consistent with pulmonary emboli. Subtle tree-in-bud and ground-glass opacities were present in the upper lobes. Scattered pulmonary nodules were present bilaterally; they were stable in size as compared with nodules observed on previous imaging studies. The main pulmonary artery measured 2.6 cm in diameter proximal to bifurcation.

Dr. Hofacker: Cycle 4 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was delayed. Treatment with intravenous heparin was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the oxygen saturation was 91% while he was at rest and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia.
Case 10-2023: A 27-Year-Old Man with Convulsions,"Dr. Nathan C. Praschan (Psychiatry): A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.
Four months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.
Three months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.
One month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed “shaking and clenching” movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.
At least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician’s hand was placed on the patient’s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient’s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell’s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician’s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.
During the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.
On the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient’s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.
On examination, the temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 111/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.
Approximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as “pretty good” and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.
The patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.
Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Functional seizures.
Case 9-2023: A 20-Year-Old Man with Shortness of Breath and Proteinuria,"Dr. Miranda M. Ravicz (Pediatrics): A 20-year-old man with bipolar disorder was transferred to this hospital because of hemoptysis and hypoxemia.
Eleven months before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Six weeks before the current presentation, he was taken to another hospital for evaluation of racing thoughts, generalized hyperactivity, and difficulty sleeping. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. During the admission, the patient was involved in an altercation and was struck on the left side of the chest; pain subsequently developed in that area. Five weeks before the current presentation, chest pain persisted, and nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite developed. The patient was transported from the psychiatric hospital to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Teresa Victoria: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe.
FIGURE 1

Initial Imaging Studies.
Dr. Ravicz: The patient was told that he had a pulmonary contusion and was transported back to the psychiatric hospital. The dosages of quetiapine and paliperidone were increased. Four weeks before the current presentation, the patient had urticaria and intermittent nausea; a single dose of methylprednisolone was administered. Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged home.
Ten days before the current presentation, chest pain continued, cough developed, and nausea increased in severity. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a second hospital. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest (Figure 1B) revealed a consolidation in the left lower lobe and a left pleural effusion.
Dr. Ravicz: A course of doxycycline was started for the treatment of presumed pneumonia, and the patient was discharged home. During the subsequent 6 days, the cough and chest pain abated. Four days before the current presentation, the course of doxycycline was completed. During the next several days, the cough increased in severity and became productive of yellow sputum with dark-red streaks, and shortness of breath developed; nausea also increased in severity. One day before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated again in the emergency department of the second hospital.
On evaluation, the patient appeared ill and had difficulty breathing. The temporal temperature was 37.5°C, the blood pressure 99/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 31 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The hemoglobin level was 11.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 14.0 to 18.0) and the albumin level 1.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.0). Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Nucleic acid amplification testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was negative for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for culture, and additional imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Victoria: CT angiography of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed emboli of the right and left pulmonary arteries that extended into multiple segmental and subsegmental branches (Figure 2). There were wedge-shaped opacities without enhancement in the left upper and lower lobes, findings consistent with infarction. There were small pleural effusions that were larger on the left side than on the right side.

Imaging Studies Obtained on Current Presentation.
Dr. Ravicz: Treatment with enoxaparin, vancomycin, and cefepime was started, and intravenous fluids were administered. The patient was admitted to the second hospital. On hospital day 2, the oxygen saturation decreased, and supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula. Blood cultures showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional evaluation and treatment.
On admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and nausea continued. The patient reported fatigue and weight loss that had started after the injury to the chest. He had also noticed discoloration in his fingers that was associated with changes in temperature. There was no headache, abdominal pain, or joint pain.
The patient had a history of asthma, migraines, and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder. Bipolar disorder had been diagnosed when he was hospitalized for mania, grandiose thoughts, and paranoid delusions. Medications included quetiapine, paliperidone, and methylphenidate. Sulfa drugs and valproate had caused rash, nausea, and vomiting. The patient had previously been sexually active with female partners. He drank alcohol rarely and vaped marijuana frequently; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother, maternal aunt, paternal aunt, and paternal uncle had depression.
On examination, the temperature was 38.6°C, the blood pressure 89/40 mm Hg, the heart rate 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The right lung was clear on auscultation, but the left lung had diminished sounds. There was no abdominal tenderness, joint swelling, or rash. The patient had a flat affect, apathy, grandiose thoughts, poverty of speech and thought, and psychomotor retardation. There was no evidence of paranoia or hallucinations. The hemoglobin level was 8.7 g per deciliter and the albumin level 1.6 g per deciliter. Urinalysis revealed 2+ blood and 3+ protein; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Diagnostic tests were performed.",Systemic lupus erythematosus with membranous lupus nephritis.
Case 8-2023: A 71-Year-Old Woman with Refractory Hemolytic Anemia,"Dr. Florence H. Porterfield (Medicine): A 71-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of refractory hemolytic anemia.
The patient, who had recurrent breast cancer and diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, had been in her usual state of health until 7 months before the current admission, when fatigue and dyspnea on exertion developed. She was reportedly evaluated by a cardiologist and a pulmonologist, but no cause for her symptoms was identified.
Two months before the current admission, dyspnea on exertion worsened, palpitations and dizziness developed, and the patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. Laboratory studies revealed anemia, a low blood level of haptoglobin, and an elevated blood level of lactate dehydrogenase. The blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A peripheral-blood smear showed schistocytes. A direct antiglobulin test was negative, complement levels were reportedly low, and a low titer of cold agglutinins was present. Testing for antibodies against β2-glycoprotein I and cardiolipin was negative, as was a screening test for lupus anticoagulant. Nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and other common respiratory viruses was negative. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood revealed no aberrant clonal population of cells and no evidence of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy that was unchanged from that observed on imaging performed 2 years earlier. Packed red cells were transfused, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Treatment with glucocorticoids was initiated for a working diagnosis of Coombs’-negative autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
On the third hospital day, anemia persisted, and additional units of packed red cells were transfused. The blood pressure had increased from 118/62 mm Hg on admission to 150/60 mm Hg. Treatment with glucocorticoids was stopped, and treatment with captopril was initiated for a working diagnosis of scleroderma renal crisis. Blood testing for the level of ADAMTS13 activity was performed, and on the sixth hospital day, treatment with plasmapheresis was started for the possible diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient underwent a total of six sessions of plasmapheresis during the first 2 weeks of the hospitalization.
During the second week of the hospitalization, treatment with eculizumab was initiated. The patient received packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days for ongoing hemolytic anemia. The results of the blood test for activity of ADAMTS13 returned; the activity level was 65% (reference value, >67%), and treatment with plasmapheresis was stopped.
During the third week of the hospitalization, treatment with eculizumab was continued, and treatment with rituximab was initiated; however, the patient still received packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days. During the fourth week of the hospitalization, weekly treatment with both eculizumab and rituximab was continued, and a 3-day course of intravenous immune globulin was administered. Despite this treatment, there was no reduction in hemolysis.
During the fifth week of the hospitalization, the patient continued to receive packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days, and thrombocytopenia developed. Treatment with glucocorticoids was resumed, and treatment with twice-weekly injections of epoetin alfa was initiated. A biopsy specimen of the bone marrow reportedly showed hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and erythroid predominance.
During the sixth week of the hospitalization, the need for red-cell transfusion persisted, treatment with cyclophosphamide was initiated, and the dose of captopril was increased. During the seventh week of the hospitalization, acute kidney injury (AKI) developed, and treatment with captopril and glucocorticoids was stopped. On the 50th hospital day, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation.
On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported nausea, poor appetite, and weight loss of 9 kg during the past 2 months. She also reported that her urine had appeared pink or cola-colored after each transfusion of packed red cells.
Twenty-one years earlier, localized clinical stage T1cpN1aM0 (according to the tumor–node–metastasis classification system), estrogen receptor (ER)–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative invasive lobular breast cancer of the left breast was diagnosed. She had been treated initially with lumpectomy, radiation, and adjuvant chemotherapy, as well as with tamoxifen for 5 years and letrozole for 2 years. Three years before the current admission, there was a locoregional recurrence of ER-positive breast cancer in her left axilla; a lymph-node biopsy was negative. Staging studies reportedly revealed mildly prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and several indeterminate hepatic and renal lesions. Biopsy of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes was reportedly negative. The patient declined recommended chemotherapeutic treatment options for recurrent breast cancer and instead opted for surveillance imaging. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and mammography of the breasts, which had been performed 6 months before the current admission, were reportedly unchanged from previous imaging. She had not palpated any new breast lumps on self-examination.
Three years before the current admission, systemic sclerosis associated with antibodies against RNA polymerase III was diagnosed. Sclerosis was limited to the skin, and the patient had not received any specific treatment. Other medical history included Sjögren’s syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, latent tuberculosis that had been diagnosed 30 years earlier and treated with isoniazid for 9 months, dyslipidemia, and osteoporosis. Medications included exemestane, goserelin, calcium, cholecalciferol, pantoprazole, and rosuvastatin. The patient took no over-the-counter remedies or supplements. She was allergic to trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, which had caused fever and hives. She drank alcohol rarely and did not use any other substances. She had smoked tobacco for 3 years but had quit 50 years before the current admission. The patient was married and lived with her husband in New England. She was retired from work in health care. Three of her sisters had had breast cancer in their seventh decades of life; there was no family history of hemolysis.
On examination, the temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 162/98 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 17. The patient was alert and oriented. There was jaundice and scleral icterus. She had a well-healed lumpectomy scar on the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There was no cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Mild skin thickening was present on the hands and feet, with subtly reduced skin mobility of the forearms and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal.
The blood level of creatinine was 2.87 mg per deciliter (254 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]), and the blood urea nitrogen level was 62 mg per deciliter (22 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [3 to 9 mmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 3+ blood and 2+ protein, without bilirubin, urobilinogen, glucose, ketones, leukocyte esterase, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed 10 to 20 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2) and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10), and there were muddy-brown casts without dysmorphic red cells. The total protein:creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample was 6.41 (reference value, <0.15). A peripheral-blood smear was obtained.
Dr. Robert Ta: The peripheral-blood smear (Figure 1) showed anisopoikilocytosis, 10 to 15 schistocytes per high-power field, teardrop cells, nucleated red cells, reticulocytes, and mature and left-shifted myeloid cells.

Dr. Porterfield: Additional imaging studies were obtained, and a diagnostic test was performed.",Breast cancer–associated thrombotic microangiopathy.
"Case 7-2023: A 70-Year-Old Man with Covid-19, Respiratory Failure, and Rashes","Dr. Carolina Geadas (Medicine): A 70-year-old man with a history of kidney transplantation was evaluated at this hospital because of multiple erythematous rashes that had developed during an admission for respiratory failure, pneumococcal bacteremia, and kidney failure.
Approximately 4.5 years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitis after he presented with progressive glomerulonephritis with kidney failure and new hemoptysis. The anti-myeloperoxidase antibody titer was 221.0 U (reference value, <2.8). The patient underwent plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were administered. Hemodialysis was initiated. Two weeks later, rituximab was administered, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were discontinued. During the next 4 years, his renal function did not improve, and treatment with rituximab and hemodialysis was continued.
Four months before the current admission, the patient underwent transplantation of a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C virus antibody–positive status. After the kidney transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy included a dose of basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and tapering doses of prednisone. The patient had delayed graft function; the blood creatinine level decreased from approximately 4.00 mg per deciliter (354 mmol per liter) immediately after transplantation to 1.50 mg per deciliter (133 mmol per liter) 6 weeks later. Six days before the current admission, at a routine follow-up visit, the creatinine level was 1.33 mg per deciliter (118 mmol per liter).
Four days before the current admission, the patient began to have central abdominal discomfort, nausea, anorexia, chills, and diarrhea with loose stools three times per day. During the next several days, he noticed decreased urine output and malaise, and he began to have rhinorrhea, cough, sinus congestion, and dyspnea. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.
A review of systems was notable for palpitations and dizziness and was negative for fever, emesis, and hematuria. The patient’s brother had recently received a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient’s medical history was notable for vasculitis with end-stage kidney disease (culminating in kidney transplantation), coronary artery disease (with placement of a stent in the right coronary artery), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cholelithiasis (with cholecystectomy), colonic polyps and diverticulosis, gout, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, hernia (with hernia repair), and spinal stenosis. Medications taken at home included mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, prednisone, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, valganciclovir, warfarin, aspirin, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, and cholecalciferol, as well as lorazepam as needed. Penicillin had caused anaphylaxis.
The patient was a retired business owner and lived with family in Boston. He had a remote history of tobacco smoking that totaled 10 pack-years; he had quit smoking approximately 40 years earlier. He did not drink alcohol or use other substances. His family history was notable for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease in his father and siblings. There was no known family history of kidney or autoimmune disease.
The temperature was 36.4°C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/56 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air, 92% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 60 liters per minute. On examination, he appeared acutely ill and weak. He had bitemporal cachexia, dry oral mucosa, and increased work of breathing. Auscultation of the chest revealed tachypnea, diminished breath sounds and crackles in the lungs, and tachycardia. There was tenderness in the periumbilical area and the right lower quadrant, at the site of the kidney transplantation; the incision was well healed.
Blood levels of lipase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine specimens were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed possible sinus tachycardia with right bundle-branch block. Vancomycin and cefepime were administered intravenously. Three hours after presentation, a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was positive, and remdesivir and dexamethasone were administered intravenously.

Dr. Joseph D. King: Radiography of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed confluent basilar consolidation in the left lung and scattered patchy opacities in the right lung. Ultrasonography that targeted the renal allograft revealed normal renal parenchyma and a trace amount of adjacent free fluid. Doppler ultrasonography (Figure 1B through 1E) showed patent vasculature with normal flow velocities but showed elevated renal arterial resistive indexes, which are suggestive of allograft dysfunction. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1F and 1G), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed confluent consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs, with more extensive findings in the left lung than in the right lung, as well as patchy multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of both lungs and the middle lobe of the right lung. Concurrent CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1H), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was remarkable for only a trace amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant, along the renal allograft.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Geadas: The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital. Phenylephrine was administered intravenously. He could not be weaned from the high-flow nasal cannula; because he had increased work of breathing and tachypnea, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation initiated. Bronchoscopy revealed dark secretions in the lower lobe and lingula of the left lung. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae in four of four bottles. A blood test for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative, and serum levels of 1,3-β-d-glucan and galactomannan were undetectable. Azithromycin, cefepime, linezolid, amiodarone, furosemide, and vitamin K were administered intravenously, and valganciclovir and atovaquone were administered orally. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed low-normal ventricular function, atrial enlargement, and no valvular vegetations. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated. ANCA titers were undetectable.
On hospital day 3, excoriation and erythema of the buttock and a purpuric plaque on the sacrum were noted (Figure 2A). Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no changes. Punch biopsy of skin on the right buttock was performed. The antibiotic regimen was transitioned to intravenous ceftriaxone.
FIGURE 2

Clinical Photographs.
The following day, histologic examination of the skin-biopsy specimen revealed epidermal necrosis, with scattered apoptotic and necrotic keratinocytes and extravasated erythrocytes. No microorganisms were identified, and microbiologic culture of the biopsy specimen was negative. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 4 are shown in Table 1.
During the next 6 days, treatment with continuous venovenous hemofiltration and intravenous ceftriaxone was continued. The level of mechanical ventilation was reduced from mandatory provided breaths to spontaneous ventilation, and the mode was switched to pressure-support ventilation. Repeat blood cultures were negative. On hospital day 11, the patient’s respiratory status worsened; the fraction of inspired oxygen was increased, and a mandatory respiratory rate was reinstituted.
Two days later, a new well-circumscribed purpuric patch was noted on the abdomen (Figure 2B). The patch measured 5 cm in greatest dimension and had a hyperpigmented halo but had no fluctuance or crepitus. The next day, a similar-appearing lesion was noted on the right thigh. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 14 are shown in Table 1.
Dr. King: Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed increased consolidative and ground-glass opacities in both lungs.
Dr. Geadas: Ceftriaxone was discontinued, and vancomycin, cefepime, and liposomal amphotericin B were administered intravenously. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.",Mucormycosis.
Case 6-2023: A 68-Year-Old Man with Recurrent Strokes,"Dr. Scott B. Silverman: A 68-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of worsening confusion.
The patient had a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. A myocardial infarction had occurred 18 years before the current admission; atrial fibrillation had also been diagnosed at that time. He had taken warfarin for many years but had stopped taking it 10 years before this admission.
Seven and a half weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to another hospital with aphasia. His score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 3, with scores ranging from 0 to 42 and higher scores indicating greater severity. The score of 3 was due to partial loss of the right visual field and mild-to-moderate aphasia and dysarthria.
Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities. CT angiography of the head and neck revealed calcified atherosclerosis along the arch of the aorta, the origin of the left vertebral artery, the intracranial portion of the left vertebral artery, the carotid bifurcations, and the cavernous portions of both internal carotid arteries; there was no hemodynamically significant stenosis. Treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and the aphasia resolved on the second hospital day.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a few small foci of acute infarction involving the frontal lobes, the posterior limb of the right internal capsule, and the right middle cerebellar peduncle. There was also a small focus of remote petechial hemorrhage in the subcortical white matter of the left parietal lobe.
Although continuous telemetry revealed no evidence of atrial fibrillation, the patient’s strokes were thought to be cardioembolic, resulting from atrial fibrillation. Treatment with aspirin was continued, clopidogrel was discontinued, and apixaban was started; previously prescribed antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine and lisinopril was resumed. The patient was discharged home on the second hospital day.
Four days after discharge, and 7 weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to the other hospital with transient mild aphasia. Results of CT of the head (performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material) and MRI of the head (performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material) were reportedly unchanged from the studies obtained 6 days earlier. The patient’s systolic blood pressure was less than 100 mm Hg, and his symptoms were thought to be due to hypoperfusion or recrudescence of symptoms from previous stroke. Treatment with amlodipine and lisinopril was stopped, and the systolic blood pressure increased. The patient was discharged home on the fourth hospital day.
Three weeks after discharge, and 3.5 weeks before the current admission, the patient’s daughter noticed that the patient had confusion and lethargy, and she took him to the other hospital for evaluation. She reported that he had new urinary incontinence, unsteady gait, and withdrawn affect. MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new foci of acute infarction involving the centrum semiovale and corona radiata bilaterally.
Dr. Javier M. Romero: CT of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed diffuse emphysematous changes, including a spiculated mass (1.7 cm in diameter) with perilesional rectilinear markings in the lower lobe of the left lung. CT of the abdomen (Figure 1B) revealed an exophytic hyperdense mass (1.6 cm in diameter) arising from the anterior cortex of the left kidney.

Initial Imaging Studies.
Dr. Silverman: On the fourth hospital day, the patient was transferred to a rehabilitation facility with plans for an oncology evaluation after discharge. After 10 days at the rehabilitation center, he was discharged home.
Three days after discharge from the rehabilitation center, and 1 week before the current admission, numbness and tingling in the right hand and forearm developed, and the patient’s daughter again took the patient to the other hospital. On examination, he had pronator drift of the right arm and dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing. MRI of the head revealed new foci of acute infarction involving the left thalamus, the subcortical white matter of the right frontal lobe, and the periventricular white matter on the left side, but there was no hemorrhage. Treatment with apixaban was stopped, and enoxaparin was started. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day.
Five days after discharge, the patient’s daughter noticed that the patient had new difficulty with swallowing pills and worsening confusion, and she brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient was not able to provide additional history, but his daughter reported that his aphasia and difficulty with balance had worsened since discharge from the other hospital. Other medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Medications included enoxaparin, aspirin, atorvastatin, and metformin. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburb of Boston and was retired. He had smoked cigarettes for 40 years, but he had recently decreased tobacco use from one pack per day to three cigarettes per day. He smoked marijuana occasionally, and he drank alcohol rarely. His father had had coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction in the fourth decade of life.
The temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 158/75 mm Hg, the pulse 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.1. The patient was alert and interactive. He was able to answer orientation questions correctly, although he was slow to respond. His speech was fluent, with no paraphasic errors. He had some difficulty with following simple commands and was unable to follow complex commands. There was decreased activation of the right nasolabial fold with preserved wrinkling of the forehead. Pronator drift of the right arm was present, and there was mild hemiparesis on the right side. The remainder of the examination was normal.
Blood levels of electrolytes and rheumatoid factor were normal, as were results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The hemoglobin level was 12.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5); the remainder of the complete blood count with differential count was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13). The d-dimer level was 912 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500). Urinalysis showed more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). A test for lupus anticoagulant was negative, as were tests for antibodies against cardiolipin and β2-glycoprotein 1. Antinuclear antibodies were present at a titer of 1:160 in a speckled pattern. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Romero: CT angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1C), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed focal encephalomalacia within the left frontal corona radiata and right cerebral peduncle. Atheromatous changes had resulted in multifocal mild narrowing of the cervical and intracranial arteries. MRI of the head (Figure 1D and 1E), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed numerous new small foci of acute infarction involving the centrum semiovale and corona radiata bilaterally, the left thalamus, the left internal capsule and lentiform nucleus, the left subinsular region, the medial right precentral gyrus, the anterior right frontal lobe, the superior frontal gyri, and the right temporal lobe. There were also several scattered patches of increased signal intensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging and T2-weighted imaging, findings that are indicative of moderate small-vessel disease.
Dr. Silverman: The patient was admitted to the hospital, and intravenous heparin was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography performed on the second hospital day revealed a normal ejection fraction and no valvular vegetations or patent foramen ovale. Blood cultures showed no growth. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.",Paraneoplastic vasculitis of the central nervous system.
"Case 5-2023: A 67-Year-Old Man with Interstitial Lung Disease, Fever, and Myalgias","Dr. Peter W. Croughan (Medicine): A 67-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, myalgias, and one previous episode of vomiting.
Nine months before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital with cough and shortness of breath, and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia was diagnosed. He received remdesivir, dexamethasone, and supplemental oxygen, which was delivered through a high-flow nasal cannula. His clinical condition gradually improved, and he was discharged home with supplemental oxygen, which was to be administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute.
While the patient was recovering at home, cough persisted and shortness of breath worsened, despite treatment with prednisone. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital, organizing pneumonia was diagnosed. Pulmonary-function testing revealed a severe restrictive ventilatory defect with impaired gas exchange, and findings on computed tomography (CT) of the chest were consistent with organizing pneumonia superimposed on fibrotic interstitial lung disease. Treatment with pirfenidone and mycophenolate mofetil was initiated, and the dose of prednisone was increased. Despite the use of these treatments, there was no decrease in dyspnea; consequently, treatment with pirfenidone was stopped, and the dose of prednisone was tapered over the course of the 2 months before the current admission. Because of persistent severe dyspnea on exertion, the patient was listed for lung transplantation 2 weeks before the current admission.
Two days before the current admission, myalgias and nausea developed, and an episode of vomiting occurred. The tympanic temperature, as measured by the patient at home, was 40.0°C. There was also a slight increase in shortness of breath, and the patient began to administer supplemental oxygen at an increased rate of 5 liters per minute. One day before the current admission, a home test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen was negative. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported a chronic dry cough that was unchanged. Other medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and prostate cancer that had been treated surgically 4 years before this admission. Medications included albuterol, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, ipratropium–albuterol delivered by nebulizer, mycophenolate mofetil, pantoprazole, prednisone, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. He had no known drug allergies. He drank three or four alcoholic drinks per week and was a lifelong nonsmoker. He lived in a rural area of New England on five acres of land with woods. He used well water at home, but he boiled drinking water before consumption. He owned a dog, and he spent time outdoors, including mowing the lawn 1 week before this admission. He had had mosquito bites but no known tick bites. He was retired from previous work as a welder.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 126/67 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.8. Respirations were slightly labored, and the patient spoke in short sentences. He was alert and oriented and answered questions appropriately. No oral thrush was present. There were crackles at the bases of both lung fields. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Urinalysis results were normal. The blood level of 1,3-β-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60), and the blood galactomannan index was 0.13 (reference range, 0.00 to 0.49). Tests for Lyme disease and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A respiratory viral panel that included testing for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids was negative. Imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Amita Sharma: Chest radiography revealed bilateral peripheral reticular opacities that were similar in appearance to those observed in studies obtained 7 and 9 months earlier and were consistent with the patient’s reported history of interstitial lung disease, with no new focal consolidation. CT of the chest (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed resolution of multifocal air-space opacities and new peripheral curvilinear opacity. There was peripheral reticulation that was unchanged from that seen in the studies obtained 7 and 9 months earlier, basilar-predominant architectural distortion, and traction bronchiectasis with evidence of honeycombing in the lung bases. There was a slight decrease in mediastinal lymphadenopathy as compared with the earlier studies and a single new paraesophageal lymph node on the right side.
FIGURE 1

CT of the Chest on Admission.
Dr. Croughan: Blood and urine cultures were obtained, and treatment with intravenous cefepime was initiated. Twelve hours after the patient presented to the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 38.8°C, the blood pressure 82/53 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. One liter of intravenous fluids was administered, and the blood pressure increased to 108/52 mm Hg. Owing to the patient’s acute illness, the dose of prednisone was increased, and he was admitted to the hospital.
On hospital day 1, fever persisted; the maximum temporal temperature was 39.9°C. The blood pressure remained stable; treatment with intravenous vancomycin was added.
On hospital day 2, pancytopenia developed, and the results of liver-function tests had worsened; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. A diagnostic test was performed.",Human granulocytic anaplasmosis.
Case 4-2023: A 56-Year-Old Man with Abnormal Results on Liver Testing,"Dr. Esperance A. Schaefer: A 56-year-old man with a history of alcohol and opioid use was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of abnormal results on liver testing.
Three years before the current presentation, the patient had elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase on routine testing performed by his primary care physician. At that time, he reported that testing for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies had been positive in the past. The HCV RNA level was undetectable; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cessation of alcohol use was advised. Two years before the current presentation, the levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase had decreased; additional laboratory test results obtained at that time are shown in Table 1.

Seven months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital because of pain and swelling in the left wrist that had lasted for 3 weeks. The temporal temperature was 36.6°C. The volar aspect of the left wrist was erythematous and swollen, as was the left knee. Tests for Lyme disease antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Radiographs showed subcutaneous edema of the left knee but no fracture, dislocation, or evidence of advanced arthropathy of the left knee or wrist. A 10-day course of prednisone was prescribed for presumed inflammatory arthritis. The joint swelling and pain resolved.
Six months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the same emergency department because of a painful rash. The temporal temperature was 36.3°C. The distal left forearm was erythematous and had scattered small subcutaneous nodules. Laboratory evaluation revealed pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and uric acid were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A plain radiograph of the left wrist showed soft-tissue edema but no abnormalities of the bone. A second course of prednisone was prescribed, and the patient was referred to a dermatologist and a gastroenterologist for consultation.
Two weeks later, the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had multiple tan macules on the face and trunk, angiomas, and reddish-purple papules (some >1 cm in diameter) on the left forearm. A biopsy of a papule on the left forearm was performed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed nonspecific suppurative and granulomatous dermatitis. No microorganisms were identified, and culture of the biopsy specimen was negative.
Four months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had spider angiomas and fullness of the left upper quadrant. On a serum-based test for liver fibrosis (FibroTest), he had a score of 0.96 (with scores of 0.00 to 0.21 indicating no fibrosis and scores of 0.74 to 1.00 indicating severe fibrosis). Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. William R. Bradley: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed a nodular hepatic contour with patchy perfusion but no focal hepatic lesions (Figure 1A). Splenomegaly, portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation, and perigastric, paraesophageal, and splenorenal collateral vessels were also identified (Figure 1B and 1C). There was no dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts; the common bile duct measured 8 mm in diameter (Figure 1D).
FIGURE 1

MRCP Images.
Dr. Schaefer: Three months before the current evaluation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. Grade 2 esophageal varices were identified and banded. Eight days later, the patient was admitted to a second hospital because of new confusion, lethargy, delayed and slurred speech, and visual hallucinations. The blood ammonia level was 99 μmol per liter (169 μg per deciliter; reference range, 11 to 60 μmol per liter [19 to 102 μg per deciliter]). Urinalysis was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. Abdominal ultrasound images showed persistent splenomegaly and heterogeneous liver echotexture without ascites. A computed tomographic scan of the head, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, a pattern consistent with incomplete right bundle-branch block, downsloping ST-segment depressions in the precordium, and a prolonged corrected QT interval. Treatment with lactulose was initiated for a working diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. Confusion resolved, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day with arrangements made for additional cardiac testing after discharge.
One month before the current evaluation, an echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, mild right ventricular dilatation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation with right atrial dilatation, and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 71 mm Hg. Perfusion images obtained during vasodilator stress testing showed no evidence of inducible left ventricular ischemia. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation.
In the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported chronic dyspnea with exertion. He had no orthopnea, chest pain, or palpitations. He had consumed six beers daily for approximately 30 years but had not consumed alcohol during the previous 18 months. Three years before the current presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of dyslipidemia, with a blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 337 mg per deciliter (8.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 129 mg per deciliter [1.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter]) and a total cholesterol level of 380 mg per deciliter (9.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 155 to 199 mg per deciliter [4.0 to 5.1 mmol per liter]). He had a history of opioid use disorder, including intravenous opioids; the disorder had been in remission with the use of buprenorphine–naloxone. Other medical history included depression, insomnia, and multiple knee surgeries. In addition to buprenorphine–naloxone, medications included lactulose, omeprazole, and trazodone. Penicillin had caused a rash. He had worked as a laborer but was disabled and no longer working. He had smoked two cigarettes daily for 30 years. His family history included stroke in his father, diabetes in his mother, and rheumatoid arthritis in his sister.
On examination, the heart rate was 73 beats per minute, the blood pressure 99/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 69.9 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.9. He was alert and oriented; asterixis was present. The lung fields were clear, and there was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable hard mass in the epigastrium, a finding that indicated a probable firm caudate lobe of the liver. The knees had healed surgical scars, and there was no edema in the legs. A few spider angiomas were present on the chest. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serologic testing was negative for antinuclear antibodies and was positive for antimitochondrial antibodies, with a titer of 1:5120.
Additional diagnostic tests were performed.",Primary biliary cholangitis with portopulmonary hypertension.
Case 3-2023: A 16-Year-Old Girl with Abdominal Pain and Bloody Diarrhea,"Dr. Erin E. Mauney (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea.
The patient had been well until 5 weeks before this admission, when diarrhea and intermittent, diffuse, crampy abdominal pain developed. During the subsequent week, the diarrhea occurred more frequently, and the abdominal pain worsened in severity, such that it sometimes awoke the patient from sleep. Four weeks before this admission, the diarrhea began to contain dark-red blood. The patient’s mother took her to the primary care clinic of another hospital.
In the primary care clinic, the weight was 98.7 kg; the physical examination was otherwise normal. The hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Stool cultures for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were negative, as were antigen tests for giardia, cryptosporidium, and Clostridioides difficile toxin. Empirical treatment with ciprofloxacin was started.
During the next 3 weeks, the patient completed the course of ciprofloxacin as instructed, but the abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea continued. On the day of this admission, diarrhea occurred at least four times. The patient’s parents called the primary care clinic and were instructed to bring her to the emergency department of this hospital.
On evaluation, the patient reported fatigue, malaise, weight loss, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea and vomiting when she ate food. She also had headache and mild, diffuse joint and muscle pain. She had had no fever or sick contacts.
The patient had obesity, anxiety, and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Medications included fluoxetine and dextroamphetamine–amphetamine; there were no known drug allergies. Menarche had occurred when she was 11 years of age, and her last menstrual period had been 2 months earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke tobacco. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her mother, father, and sister, as well as her pet dog, cat, and lizard. She attended a technical high school with an emphasis on agriculture, and she had frequent interactions with marine and farm animals through school. Her family history included colorectal cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in her maternal grandfather, diverticulosis in her maternal grandmother and mother, psoriasis in her maternal grandmother and uncle, and celiac disease in her paternal cousin. Her father had hyperlipidemia, and her mother had had one miscarriage, which had occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy.
On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4°C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 94/68 mm Hg. The weight was 89.8 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.7. The patient appeared pale, tired, and uncomfortable because of pain. The mucous membranes were dry. The abdomen was nondistended, and there was mild tenderness in both lower quadrants. There was no ulceration or rash.
The white-cell count was 10,690 per microliter (reference range in children 12 to 17 years of age, 4500 to 10,700), the platelet count 188,000 per microliter, and the hemoglobin level 9.8 g per deciliter. The blood level of C-reactive protein was 248.0 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 71 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, and ondansetron were administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital.

On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level was 8.2 g per deciliter, and one unit of packed red cells was transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed.
Dr. Maureen M. Leonard: On EGD, two cratered esophageal ulcers were located 30 cm from the incisors (Figure 1A). The proximal, middle, and distal portions of the esophagus were normal. Diffuse mild inflammation — characterized by erythema and friability — was found in the cardia, gastric fundus, and gastric antrum (Figure 1B). The duodenum appeared normal. Biopsy specimens were obtained throughout the procedure for histologic evaluation.
FIGURE 1

Images Obtained during Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and Colonoscopy.
When the patient was being positioned on the procedure table for the colonoscopy, a large volume of bright-red blood was noted to be draining from the rectum. Perianal and digital rectal examinations did not reveal a source of bleeding. Emergency radiography of the abdomen did not reveal free air, and the colonoscopy was started. On colonoscopy, the rectum and proximal sigmoid colon appeared normal (Figure 1C). However, as the colonoscope was advanced farther into the sigmoid colon, multiple nonobstructing, large, friable, dark-violet lesions were identified and biopsied (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F). Because of narrowing and severe friability, the area was not traversed with the endoscope, and the procedure was aborted.
Dr. Mauney: The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of this hospital. During the subsequent 2 days, an additional two units of packed red cells were transfused. Treatment with pantoprazole was started.
Dr. Sjirk J. Westra: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and chest was performed (Figure 2A through 2D). There was irregular thickening of the large bowel wall and adjacent fat stranding, with sparing of the distal sigmoid colon and rectum. The kidneys had multifocal patchy areas of hypoattenuation.
FIGURE 2

Initial Imaging Studies.
Dr. Mauney: On hospital day 5, tachycardia and tachypnea developed. The hemoglobin level was 8.8 g per deciliter, and the platelet count was 67,000 per microliter. The prothrombin time was 17.3 seconds (reference range, 11.5 to 14.5), the prothrombin-time international normalized ratio 1.4 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), the activated partial-thromboplastin time 50.0 seconds (reference range, 22.0 to 36.0), and the blood d-dimer level greater than 10,000 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Westra: Thoracic CT angiography revealed a central filling defect in the distal right pulmonary artery, a finding consistent with pulmonary embolism (Figure 2E). There was also a large right pleural effusion.
Dr. Mauney: A diagnostic test was performed.",Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome.
Case 2-2023: A 76-Year-Old Man with Dizziness and Altered Mental Status,"Dr. George Karandinos (Medicine): A 76-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of dizziness and altered mental status.
On the day of the current evaluation, the patient was observed crawling on a city sidewalk. He appeared pale and diaphoretic. On evaluation by emergency medical services, he reported feeling dizzy and “weird.” A fingerstick blood glucose level was 152 mg per deciliter (8.4 mmol per liter). He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient could not recall recent events, but he reported shortness of breath, as well as chronic back pain and persistent ringing in the ears. He was unable to give additional details of his history, but he provided the name of the hospital where he routinely received care. On a phone consultation, physicians at that hospital reported that the patient had a history of traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, seizure disorder, chronic back pain due to spinal stenosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety. Prescribed medications included lisinopril and transdermal lidocaine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had consumed alcohol in the past but not for 40 years. His family history was unknown.
The temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 183/113 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient appeared disheveled and diaphoretic. He was somnolent but awakened to verbal stimuli. He was oriented to person, place, and time but only intermittently followed commands. A small superficial skin abrasion was noted above the left eyebrow. There was mild tenderness on palpation of the midback but no other evidence of trauma. The remainder of the examination was normal.
Point-of-care ultrasonography, performed with an approach known as FAST (focused assessment with sonography for trauma), showed no abnormalities. The blood ethanol level was undetectable, and urine toxicologic testing was negative for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opiates. The blood levels of lipase, magnesium, and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. There was mild normocytic anemia, but the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Samples of blood and urine were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, intraventricular conduction delay, left axis deviation, and nonspecific minor ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Brooks P. Applewhite: Radiographs of the chest and pelvis showed no acute abnormalities. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1A) revealed nonspecific mild white-matter changes, a nonspecific small focal calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter, atherosclerosis without high-grade cerebrovascular stenosis, and multilevel spondylotic changes without severe spinal canal stenosis. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarction. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1B and 1C) revealed no evidence of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, lung consolidation, or pericardial effusion. There was a left adrenal nodule that measured 19 mm in diameter, a finding consistent with an adenoma.
FIGURE 1

Initial Imaging Studies.
Dr. Karandinos: Normal saline with 5% dextrose was administered intravenously. During the next 8 hours, the patient was agitated and combative. He repeatedly removed peripheral intravenous catheters and disconnected monitors. He was no longer oriented to place or time. Two doses of olanzapine were administered intravenously, and the patient slept for several hours during the night.
Sixteen hours after the patient arrived in the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 37.7°C, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the blood pressure 160/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The patient was observed to be breathing deeply. He was able to state his name, but his speech was otherwise nonsensical and dysarthric. He followed commands only when visual cues were given; for example, he stuck out his tongue after the examiner demonstrated the task. Motor, sensory, and reflex examinations were normal; tests of cerebellar function were not performed. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The results of electroencephalography (EEG) were normal, without epileptiform abnormalities. Normal saline with potassium chloride was administered intravenously, as was lorazepam. Additional imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Applewhite: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2) revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute or subacute infarction. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed a mild burden of white-matter signal hyperintensities, which are nonspecific but typical of chronic small-vessel disease. The previously detected calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter correlated with an 8-mm focus of T1 and T2 signal abnormalities with associated susceptibility blooming, a finding suggestive of either a calcified cavernous malformation or sequelae of previous infection or inflammation.
FIGURE 2

MRI of the Head.
Dr. Karandinos: The patient’s mental status did not improve. Twenty-four hours after he arrived in the emergency department, he was admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of seizure. The temporal temperature was 37.6°C, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 151/70 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. Respiratory effort appeared increased. He was somnolent, and he followed simple commands but did not open his eyes in response to sternal rub. The blood levels of creatine kinase, fibrinogen, and ammonia were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Thiamine was administered intravenously. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.",Chronic salicylate toxicity.
Case 1-2023: A 49-Year-Old Man with Hypokalemia and Paranoia,"Dr. David J. Bozym (Medicine): A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypokalemia and paranoid thoughts.
Six months before the current admission, discomfort on the right side of the chest developed, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital.
Dr. Mark C. Murphy: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung that measured 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm, as well as bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
FIGURE 1

Images Obtained 6 Months before Current Admission.
Dr. Bozym: An endobronchial ultrasound–guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node was performed. Cytologic examination of the specimen revealed small-cell carcinoma.
Five months before the current admission, the patient sought a second opinion in the oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient was counseled about the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer and the need for additional imaging before consideration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Additional imaging was scheduled, along with a follow-up appointment. The patient did not undergo additional imaging and did not attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic of either this hospital or the other hospital.
Six weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed swelling of both legs. Ten days before this admission, the swelling had not abated, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.
In the emergency department, the patient described himself as generally healthy and did not report any chronic health conditions. He reported no fever, chills, shortness of breath, or pain. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s brother. The patient had been pursuing alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer that included a strict diet and intravenous infusions, and he had not shared the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer with his family until several days earlier. The patient’s brother believed that the patient was in denial about the diagnosis.
When the patient was 12 years of age, he had received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which had been treated with radiation therapy and splenectomy. Fifteen years before this presentation, ischemic colitis had been treated with small-bowel resection. One year before this presentation, deep-vein thrombosis had been treated with a 4-month course of anticoagulation. There was no history of psychiatric disease. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies; he did not disclose details about the infusions that he had received as alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents. He was divorced and frequently visited his children. He worked part-time as a skilled tradesman. Family members reported that he was a lifelong nonsmoker.
The temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 167/95 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and appeared well, but he looked thinner than he had looked during his evaluation at the oncology clinic 5 months earlier. The abdomen had a healed surgical scar, and the legs had symmetric 1+ edema. The blood potassium level was 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.1); the white-cell count was 14,630 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis.

Dr. Murphy: CT pulmonary angiography of the chest (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a marked increase in the size of the left-lung mass, which now measured 9.3 cm by 4.6 cm, as well as enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed numerous new ill-defined rim-enhancing hepatic lesions, which measured up to 8.0 cm in diameter; an adrenal mass, which measured 4.1 cm by 3.4 cm; and thrombosis of the branches of the right portal vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal.
FIGURE 2

Images Obtained on Current Admission.
Dr. Bozym: Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the next 3 days, additional supplemental potassium was administered. During follow-up interviews, the patient acknowledged the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer, but he did not explain why he had not shared the diagnosis with his family or provide details about the alternative treatment that he had pursued. On the fourth hospital day, the blood potassium level increased, and the patient asked to go home. He stated that he was willing to attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic, but he was evasive when chemotherapy and immunotherapy were discussed. The patient was discharged.
One week after discharge, and 1 day before the current admission, the patient’s father accompanied the patient to receive massage therapy and an intravenous infusion as alternative treatment. During the infusion, the patient abruptly became volatile, agitated, and angry. On the drive home, he refused to close the window and stared into the distance. He stated that doctors had cast spells on him during his recent hospitalization and that he had killed his oldest child, which was not true.
The next day, the patient borrowed his brother’s car without permission and drove across the state. After he returned home, family members brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient stated that he was “embarrassed” for being in the hospital. He initially reported no symptoms, but on specific questioning, he acknowledged fatigue, weight loss, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and ongoing leg swelling. He reported that he did not feel confused, afraid, or worried and that he had no suicidal or homicidal thoughts or auditory or visual hallucinations. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s family members. The patient had not slept for several days. His aggressive and erratic behavior and delusions were not typical, although he could become easily angered and had a long-standing belief that his doctors had administered radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma to make money.
The temporal temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 194/106 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The patient alternated between being alert and lethargic, and he could state the names of his children but not their ages. He was cooperative but intermittently paused and stared; he was not distracted by external stimuli, but he seemed to be responding to internal stimuli. He spoke only a couple of words at a time and answered most questions by nodding or shaking his head. There was generalized weakness, which was most pronounced in the proximal muscle groups. The leg edema was unchanged, and the skin appeared abnormally tan; there was no scleral icterus, sublingual jaundice, or asterixis.
The blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter, the carbon dioxide level 37 mmol per liter (reference range, 22 to 32), and the ammonia level 51 μmol per liter (87 μg per deciliter; reference range, 12 to 48 μmol per liter [20 to 82 μg per deciliter]). The white-cell count was 13,530 per microliter. Urinalysis was normal, and urine and blood toxicologic testing was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, was normal. Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Cushing’s syndrome due to ectopic secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone from small-cell lung cancer.
Case 40-2022: A 38-Year-Old Man with Exertional Chest Discomfort,"Dr. J. Sawalla Guseh: A 38-year-old man was evaluated at the cardiology clinic of this hospital because of exertional chest discomfort.
The patient had been a competitive athlete in the past and had remained an avid runner. Approximately 15 years before the current evaluation, while he was running, he had episodes of flushing with diffuse cutaneous swelling involving the face, lips, hands, and trunk, along with hives on the abdomen and legs and associated dyspnea. The first episode occurred in autumn and the second episode the following summer. After the second episode, he lost consciousness while sitting on a bench. The next day, he was evaluated at an urgent care center. A Holter monitor was placed, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was reportedly normal. The patient consulted with an allergist, who made a diagnosis of food-related exercise-induced anaphylaxis with reactions to soybeans, chickpeas, and tahini, on the basis of the foods he had eaten before these episodes and the results of radioallergosorbent testing. An epinephrine autoinjector was prescribed for use during future episodes, but the anaphylaxis symptoms did not recur.
Approximately 4 months before the current evaluation, during a routine 5-mile jog, the patient had a new sensation that he described as “my heart beating out of my chest.” He rested, and the symptom subsided; he completed his run. One month later, during a bicycle ride, he had “crampy” discomfort in the anterior chest, which abated when he stopped cycling. Two weeks before the current evaluation, during a jog of several miles, he had cramping pain in the anterior chest on the left side that gradually escalated over a 5-minute period. He started walking, and the pain abated; he ran for an additional 20 minutes without a recurrence of pain. He sought an evaluation in the cardiology clinic of this hospital to determine the cause of his symptoms and the safety of continued vigorous exercise.
On evaluation in the cardiology clinic, a review of systems was negative for dyspnea, recent syncope, orthopnea, edema, cough, hemoptysis, and recent allergic symptoms. The patient ran or cycled four times per week and had previously completed a marathon. His medical history included attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder. Five years earlier, an episode of syncope had occurred in the context of multiple episodes of nonbloody diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and chills. His surgical history included two colonic polypectomies, one 6 years before this evaluation and the other 1 month before this evaluation; pathological examination of the polyps had revealed lymphoid aggregates and hyperplastic polyps. The patient took no medications and reported no adverse reactions to medications.
The patient worked in the financial sector and lived with his wife and children. He did not use tobacco, alcohol, or other substances. Multiple maternal relatives had had colon cancer, and an older brother had had colonic polyps removed in his fourth decade of life. There was a family history of hypertension.
On examination, the blood pressure was 122/84 mm Hg (measured in both arms), the heart rate 54 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were mild expiratory wheezes; the remainder of the examination was normal.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities, findings that had been observed on tracings obtained 5 years earlier during an evaluation for presyncope; a TTE obtained at that time had been normal. Sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities had not been observed on tracings obtained 15 years earlier (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C). The white-cell count and platelet count were normal, as were blood levels of hemoglobin, electrolytes, calcium, and thyrotropin and results of renal-function tests. The high-sensitivity troponin level was 10 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14). Plasma metanephrines were undetectable, and the normetanephrine level was normal. The next day, a TTE showed no abnormalities of cardiac chamber size and function and no evidence of valvular dysfunction.
FIGURE 1

Electrocardiograms and Transthoracic Echocardiograms.
An ambulatory patch heart monitor, applied to evaluate cardiac rhythm over a 2-week period, revealed sinus rhythm without arrhythmia. A cardiopulmonary exercise stress test was performed; the patient exercised for 19 minutes 17 seconds according to a treadmill protocol that increased incrementally to maximal effort with a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.12 and a maximum heart rate of 181 beats per minute (99% of the age-predicted maximum). At peak effort, the stress test did not reproduce symptoms, and he stopped because of leg fatigue. An ECG showed 0.5-mm horizontal ST-segment depression in leads III, aVF, V3, and V6, along with isolated premature ventricular contractions. The ventilatory efficiency was normal.
Additional diagnostic testing was performed, and management decisions were made.",Cardiac paraganglioma with a germline mutation in the gene encoding succinate dehydrogenase subunit C (SDHC).
Case 39-2022: A 31-Year-Old Woman with Postpartum Abdominal Pain and Fever,"Dr. Megan E. Bunnell (Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 31-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital 15 days after the birth of her first child because of abdominal pain and fever.
The patient had received routine prenatal care at this hospital. Serologic screening during the pregnancy showed immunity to rubella. Rectovaginal culture was positive for group B streptococcus. Tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative.
Sixteen days before this admission, the patient went into labor at 38 weeks 1 day of gestation. She was admitted to this hospital. The white-cell count was 13,800 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), and the hemoglobin level was 14.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0); treatment with intravenous penicillin was started. On hospital day 2, an epidural anesthetic agent was administered. Artificial rupture of the membranes revealed clear, odorless fluid, and infusion of oxytocin was started. Six hours after artificial rupture of the membranes, the patient gave birth to a healthy baby by vaginal delivery. Three minutes later, the placenta was delivered intact. Immediately after delivery, hemorrhage due to uterine atony occurred; there was an estimated blood loss of 500 ml. Bimanual massage of the uterus was performed, and oxytocin and methylergonovine were administered; hemostasis was subsequently achieved. A perineal laceration was repaired. The patient began breast-feeding, and on postpartum day 1, she was discharged.
Six days before the current admission, on postpartum day 9, pain in the left upper quadrant developed. The pain was dull, radiated to the left flank and back, and was worse with movement and deep breathing. The patient presented to a local urgent care clinic; urine was obtained for culture, and empirical treatment with amoxicillin–clavulanate was started.
Five days before this admission, on postpartum day 10, abdominal pain persisted, and a fever with a temporal temperature of 38.3°C developed. The patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. She rated the abdominal pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. A review of systems was notable for nausea and minimal lochia; there was no diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, or breast tenderness.
On examination, the abdomen was soft, and there was mild tenderness on palpation of the left upper quadrant, the uterine fundus, the suprapubic region, and the left costovertebral angle. Pelvic examination, including examination with the use of a speculum, revealed no dehiscence, drainage, or hematoma at the site of the perineal laceration repair and no discharge from the cervical os; there was mild cervical motion tenderness. The white-cell count was 20,700 per microliter. The level of hemoglobin was 11.4 g per deciliter. Blood cultures were obtained. The urine culture obtained at the urgent care clinic was positive for group B streptococcus. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with ceftriaxone was started, and the patient was admitted to the hospital for presumed pyelonephritis. On hospital day 3, when the fever and abdominal pain resolved, the patient was discharged home to complete a course of amoxicillin.

During the subsequent 2 days, the patient continued to take amoxicillin at home, but fever and abdominal and flank pain returned. On postpartum day 15, when the pain did not abate after she took acetaminophen, she returned to the emergency department of this hospital.
The patient’s medical history included high-grade cervical dysplasia that had led to a loop electrosurgical excision procedure 5 years earlier, as well as a ruptured ovarian cyst 3 years earlier and nephrolithiasis on the left side 5 months earlier. The patient had not been pregnant before the recent pregnancy; before this pregnancy, she had taken oral contraceptives for 12 years. She took prenatal vitamins, as well as polyethylene glycol, docusate, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen as needed. She had no known drug allergies. She lived with her husband and newborn infant in an urban area of New England and worked as an office manager. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had multiple sclerosis and her father had coronary artery disease; her brother was healthy.
On examination, the abdomen was soft, and there was mild tenderness in the left upper quadrant and at the left costovertebral angle. There was no tenderness on palpation of the uterine fundus or the suprapubic region and no cervical motion tenderness. The white-cell count was 10,330 per microliter. The hemoglobin level was 11.2 g per deciliter, the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level 153 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level 44 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32), and the alkaline phosphatase level 194 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital. The next day, the hemoglobin level decreased to 9.7 g per deciliter.
Additional studies were performed, and a diagnosis was made.",Hepatic adenoma.
Case 38-2022: A 21-Year-Old Woman with Fatigue and Weight Gain,"Dr. Kathy M. Tran (Medicine): A 21-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of fatigue, weight gain, and abdominal pain.
The patient had been well until 4 months before the current evaluation, when an episode of dull, aching pain in the right lower quadrant occurred. The pain lasted for a few hours before resolving spontaneously. During the next 4 months, episodes of abdominal pain continued to occur and increased in duration, frequency, and severity. The patient sought evaluation in the gynecology clinic of this hospital.
On evaluation, the patient described the pain as variable, rating it between 3 and 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The episodes of pain occurred daily and lasted for up to 20 hours. The pain decreased with sitting or lying down and did not increase with movement; it was not associated with her menstrual period. The patient also reported fatigue, irritability, and weight gain of 4.5 kg in the previous 4 months despite increased exercise and decreased food intake.
There was a history of hypothyroidism, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and migraines. The patient had never been pregnant and had no known history of sexually transmitted infections or abnormal results on screening tests for cervical cancer. She had previously been sexually active with male partners, but she reported no current sexual activity. She had taken oral contraceptives for 2 years but had stopped taking them 6 months before this evaluation, when a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) was placed. Other medications included levothyroxine, citalopram, and multivitamins; there were no known drug allergies.
The patient lived with roommates in an urban area of New England. She was a former athlete and worked as a research scientist. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her mother, coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia in her father, breast cancer and diabetes in her paternal grandmother, and lung cancer in her paternal grandfather.
On examination, the blood pressure was 119/73 mm Hg and the heart rate 62 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The thyroid was firm on palpation, with a small nodule noted on the right side. The abdomen was nondistended, soft, and nontender. A small hernia with a thrill was noted at the right inguinal ring. A speculum examination of the vagina and cervix was normal; IUD strings were visible at the cervical os. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes and glucose and results of tests for kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis were negative. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Madeleine Sertic: Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass (measuring 4.8 cm by 5.0 cm by 3.9 cm) along the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe (Figure 1A). The uterus, ovaries, and adnexa were normal. There was no free fluid in the pelvis, and the IUD was in an appropriate position.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a right adrenal mass (measuring 4.5 cm by 4.7 cm by 4.0 cm) that was T2 isointense (Figure 1B) and T1 hypointense. The mass had diffusion restriction (Figure 1C), as well as early enhancement with washout, which refers to the temporal reduction in the enhancement of a lesion. The features were indeterminate and were not definitively diagnostic of adrenal adenoma or another adrenal lesion, such as pheochromocytoma or adrenocortical carcinoma.
Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis again revealed a right adrenal mass, which had a density of 33 Hounsfield units (HU) before the administration of contrast material (Figure 1D), 74 HU during the portal-venous phase (Figure 1E), and 45 HU during the 15-minute delayed phase (Figure 1F). The absolute washout was calculated as 71%. The absolute washout is calculated by dividing the difference between the portal-venous–phase density and the delayed-phase density by the difference between the portal-venous–phase density and the unenhanced density and then converting the result to a percentage: [(HU portal-venous phase − HU delayed phase) / (HU portal-venous phase − HU unenhanced)] × 100. Adrenal adenomas tend to wash out faster than other adrenal lesions, and an absolute washout of more than 60% is highly suggestive of an adrenal adenoma. However, lesions larger than 4 cm are likely to be malignant, regardless of the washout characteristics.1 There was also a thin-walled cyst (measuring 3.3 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the left lung.
Dr. Tran: The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Additional laboratory tests were performed to further evaluate the adrenal mass. Blood levels of renin and aldosterone were normal, as were urinary levels of catecholamines and metanephrines. An overnight, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed. The baseline blood corticotropin level was 3 pg per milliliter (0.7 pmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 76 pg per milliliter [1.3 to 16.7 pmol per liter]). At 11 p.m., dexamethasone (1 mg) was administered; at 8 a.m., the blood cortisol level was 9.1 μg per deciliter (251 nmol per liter; reference value, <1.8 μg per deciliter [50 nmol per liter]), and the concurrent blood dexamethasone level was 631 ng per deciliter (reference range, 140 to 295). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 31.0 μg (reference range, 3.5 to 45.0); the blood levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were normal.
Management decisions were made.",Adrenocortical carcinoma.
"Case 37-2022: A 55-Year-Old Man with Fatigue, Weight Loss, and Pulmonary Nodules","Dr. Jarone Lee: A 55-year-old man was admitted to this hospital 7 months after kidney transplantation because of fatigue, weight loss, and new pulmonary nodules.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 week before this admission, when severe fatigue and generalized weakness developed. He had lost 4.5 kg in the past month after making healthier dietary choices; however, he had also noticed abdominal discomfort and a decrease in appetite.
During the next week, the patient was able to eat and drink very little and lost an additional 4.5 kg. The fatigue and weakness worsened, and he mostly stayed in bed. He had several episodes of lightheadedness, gait instability, and falls while he was walking to the bathroom. There was new odynophagia, dysphagia, and nausea.
On the day of admission, the patient was evaluated at the transplant nephrology clinic of this hospital before a scheduled infusion of belatacept. The temperature was 37.3°C, the blood pressure 70/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared cachectic and lethargic. He was transported by ambulance from the clinic to the emergency department of this hospital.
In the emergency department, the patient reported malaise and feeling like he had no energy or strength. The lightheadedness and gait instability persisted. A review of systems was notable for shortness of breath, dark urine, and continued anorexia, nausea, odynophagia, dysphagia, and abdominal discomfort. He reported no chills, night sweats, cough, chest pain, vomiting, hematochezia, melena, or dysuria.
The patient had a history of sarcoidosis. Nine years before this admission, nephrocalcinosis caused end-stage kidney disease. Hemodialysis was started, and this treatment was continued until a deceased-donor kidney transplantation was performed 7 months before this admission. Routine serologic testing performed before transplantation was positive for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) IgG and cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG. An interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Serologic testing in the donor was also positive for EBV IgG but was negative for CMV IgG. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin was initiated; maintenance therapy included prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus.
Six months before the current admission, pathological examination of a biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed vascular disease of donor origin and acute tubular injury but no evidence of T-cell–mediated or antibody-mediated rejection. Treatment with tacrolimus was stopped and belatacept started; prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil therapy was continued.
One month before the current admission, pathological examination of another biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed focal infiltrates that were vaguely granulomatous and were associated with ruptured tubules and interstitial Tamm–Horsfall protein (also known as uromodulin). There was no evidence of allograft rejection.
Two weeks before the current admission, laboratory tests revealed a blood creatinine level of 2.31 mg per deciliter (204.2 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53.0 to 132.6 μmol per liter]); routine laboratory tests had revealed similar creatinine levels during the previous 6 months. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

The patient also had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gout. Current medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, labetalol, nifedipine, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, valganciclovir, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and belatacept. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his mother in an urban area of New England and had never traveled outside the region. He worked as an administrator and had never been homeless or incarcerated. He had no sexual partners and did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol.
On the day of evaluation in the emergency department, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.5. The patient was lethargic and spoke in sentences of three or four words. The mucous membranes were dry, and the throat could not be evaluated because of nausea. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Auscultation of the lungs revealed diffuse inspiratory crackles. Neurologic examination was limited but was notable for 4/5 motor strength in the arms and legs.
The blood level of creatinine was 5.05 mg per deciliter (446.4 μmol per liter), the calcium level 13.1 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), the lactic acid level 4.4 mmol per liter (39.6 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18.0 mg per deciliter]), and the hemoglobin level 6.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5). Cultures of blood were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Mark C. Murphy: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the chest (Figure 1) revealed innumerable bilateral miliary pulmonary nodules that were new relative to a CT scan that had been obtained 6 months earlier. The nodules were in a random distribution that was suggestive of a hematogenous origin. Trace bilateral pleural effusions were present, as was calcified mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy; the lymphadenopathy appeared unchanged from previous imaging. CT of the spleen (Figure 2) revealed new splenomegaly. There was new mild dilatation of the renal collecting system of the transplanted kidney in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.

CT of the Abdomen and Spleen.
Dr. Lee: While the patient was being evaluated in the emergency department, the temperature increased to 39.6°C. Intravenous fluids and intravenous infusion of phenylephrine were administered. Empirical treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, levofloxacin, doxycycline, and micafungin was started; trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole and valganciclovir were continued. Treatment with prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued, and hydrocortisone therapy was started. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit.
Within 24 hours after admission, the oxygen saturation had decreased to 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air; supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 94%. Continuous intravenous infusion of phenylephrine was continued, and norepinephrine was added to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mm Hg. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The creatinine level decreased to 3.82 mg per deciliter (337.7 μmol per liter), the lactic acid level to 1.6 mmol per liter (14.4 mg per deciliter), and the calcium level to 8.9 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter). Treatment with levofloxacin and micafungin was stopped; isavuconazole was started.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Disseminated Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.
Case 36-2022: A 30-Year-Old Woman with Decreased Vision and Headache,"Dr. Bart K. Chwalisz: A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at a hospital affiliated with this hospital because of monocular vision loss.
Two months before the current presentation, during the third trimester of the patient’s first pregnancy, headache and decreased vision in the right eye developed. The patient thought that the headache felt like previous migraines, which had been infrequent. However, decreased vision had not been a typical feature of her migraines. Colors appeared dim, and light perception was decreased. There was soreness in the right eye but no pain with eye movement.
Five days later, the patient was evaluated by an optometrist. She reported that she could see only shapes and movements. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye but no response in the right eye. The patient was instructed to seek evaluation in an emergency department of another hospital.
In the emergency department, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, which was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material because of the pregnancy, revealed marked enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve. The nerve appeared isointense as compared with the extraocular muscles on the T1-weighted sequences but appeared bright on the T2-weighted sequence; the globes appeared normal, and the extraocular muscles were not enlarged. The results of magnetic resonance venography of the head were normal.
The patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated for a working diagnosis of optic neuritis. During the hospitalization, her ability to see colors improved slightly, but her vision did not improve; she could see only hand motions. On the fifth hospital day, she was discharged home with instructions to schedule follow-up appointments with a neurologist and an optometrist.
One month after discharge from the other hospital and 2 weeks before the current presentation, the patient was again evaluated by her optometrist. The vision in the right eye had worsened; she was no longer able to see shadows or movements. The patient was referred for evaluation by a neuro-ophthalmologist.
On the current presentation to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic of a hospital affiliated with this hospital, the patient reported no improvement in vision and ongoing soreness in the right eye. There was a history of Lyme disease, which had been diagnosed during the second trimester of pregnancy and had been treated with amoxicillin. Medications included prenatal vitamins and ferrous sulfate. The patient lived with her husband in New England and worked in health care. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. A brother had a history of childhood epilepsy, and her mother had macular degeneration.
On examination, the visual acuity was 20/15 in the left eye, and there was no light perception in the right eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, although the response in the right pupil was sluggish; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the right eye. On the Ishihara color test, all plates were identified with the left eye. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye. The Ishihara color test and the visual field test could not be performed on the right eye because of poor vision. The results of a slit-lamp examination were normal, with no cells identified in the anterior chamber or vitreous. On a funduscopic examination (Figure 1A and 1B), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had temporal pallor; there was a small area of hypopigmentation close to the macula in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed increased thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer and circumferential thinning of the ganglion cell complex of the right eye; no abnormalities were noted in the left eye.
FIGURE 1

Funduscopic Images.
The blood creatinine level was 0.56 mg per deciliter (50 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]) and the blood alkaline phosphatase level 147 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). The results of other kidney-function and liver-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, the complete blood count, and the results of coagulation tests. The blood C-reactive protein level was 15 mg per liter (reference value, <8) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 34 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). A blood test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern. Tests for antibodies against aquaporin-4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) were negative. A diagnosis of atypical optic neuritis was considered. Because the patient was near delivery, further treatment was delayed until after the birth of her child, which occurred 3 days later.
Six days after delivery of the baby, the patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional studies were obtained. Lumbar puncture was performed. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, there were no nucleated cells, and the levels of protein, glucose, albumin, and IgG were normal. There was no oligoclonal banding after concentration of the CSF. Testing of the CSF was negative for syphilis antibodies and for antibodies against aquaporin-4.
Dr. Benjamin M. Kozak: MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed prominent fusiform enlargement of a segment of the intraorbital right optic nerve with associated enhancement, as well as associated hyperintensity on the T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence. There was no evidence of associated orbital edema or other orbital abnormalities. There was a punctate hyperintense focus within the left parietal subcortical white matter on the T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, without associated enhancement or restricted diffusion.
FIGURE 2

MRI of the Head.
Dr. Chwalisz: Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone and daily plasmapheresis was administered. On the fourth hospital day, the soreness in the right eye had resolved, and there was light perception in the right eye. On the fifth hospital day, treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was changed to oral prednisone. On the ninth hospital day, rituximab was administered, and the patient was discharged home with a prescription for a 7-week tapering course of prednisone.
During the next 3 weeks, treatment with rituximab was administered weekly. Two weeks after the last rituximab infusion, the patient was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at the hospital affiliated with this hospital. She reported no eye pain and only occasional headache, but she noted that the vision in the right eye had worsened. Examination revealed no light perception in the right eye, with an afferent pupillary defect. The results of a visual field test and the Ishihara color test were unchanged from the previous evaluation in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic. On a funduscopic examination (Figure 1C), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had more pronounced temporal pallor; optociliary shunt vessels were also newly present. Additional imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Kozak: Follow-up MRI of the head (Figure 2) revealed no radiologically significant change in the segmental enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve, with persistent enhancement as well as hyperintensity on the T2-weighted STIR sequence. No new orbital abnormalities were present. In addition, the punctate lesion in the left parietal subcortical white matter was unchanged.
Dr. Chwalisz: A diagnostic procedure was performed.","Meningioma, meningothelial type, World Health Organization grade 1."
"Case 35-2022: A 60-Year-Old Man with Progressive Dyspnea, Neck Swelling, and a Lung Mass","Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 60-year-old man was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of new dyspnea, cough, neck swelling, and a lung mass.
Three days before the current admission, the patient was transported to another hospital by ambulance. He had a 5-day history of sore throat, swelling of his neck and both arms, and orthopnea. He reported that he had had progressive dyspnea with walking or lifting items at his job for the past year; the dyspnea had been most prominent during the 4 months before this evaluation and had been accompanied by persistent nonproductive cough. His daughter, a health care worker, called emergency medical services when she noticed that he had facial redness and flushing and learned of the swelling of his neck and arms.
On evaluation at the other hospital, the temperature was 35.6°C, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/57 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The face was flushed, and the neck was swollen. Breath sounds were absent in the right lung fields. The blood levels of troponin I and amylase were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed a new mass in the hilar region of the right upper lobe that measured 9.2 cm in greatest dimension. There was evidence of mass effect on the right main pulmonary artery and right main-stem and right upper-lobe bronchi, encasement of the right bronchus intermedius, occlusion of the superior vena cava (SVC) and narrowing of the right superior pulmonary vein, pulmonary emboli in the pulmonary artery of the left lower lobe, consolidation and atelectasis in the right upper lobe, chest-wall edema and extensive venous collateral vessels, and bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and intravenous piperacillin–tazobactam and heparin were administered.
The next day, thoracentesis was performed, and 500 ml of cloudy yellow fluid was removed. On analysis of the pleural fluid, the fluid glucose level was 98 mg per deciliter (5.4 mmol per liter), the protein level 3.4 g per deciliter, the lactate dehydrogenase level 74 U per liter, and the pH 7.5. Gram’s staining of the pleural fluid revealed no organisms, and no malignant cells were identified on cytologic analysis. Ultrasonography of the legs showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis. CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed no hemorrhage or stroke, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis reportedly revealed subcentimeter lucent areas in the iliac bones. The next day, the patient was transferred to the oncology unit of this hospital for further evaluation and care.
On admission to this hospital, the patient reported that, during the past 3 days, he had had progressive swelling of both upper arms, as well as pain in the right shoulder and arm. He noted weight loss of approximately 10 kg in the past 6 months, anorexia, hoarse voice, dizziness with changes in position (including bending forward), and dyspnea on exertion. A review of systems was negative for hemoptysis, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, changes in bowel habits, vomiting, abdominal pain, night sweats, headache, and diplopia.
Medical history included surgery on the shoulder and leg. The patient took no medications, and there were no known adverse reactions to medications. He was self-employed and had worked in plumbing and engineering. He had smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 40 years and smoked marijuana occasionally. He drank five beers per day two times per week. His family history was notable for pancreatic cancer in his mother.
The temperature was 37.1°C, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 114/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 90 kg, the height 172 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 30.6. There was neck swelling and erythema, with no stridor. Jugular venous distention was present. On auscultation, the heart sounds were tachycardic but distant, and the lung sounds were markedly decreased on the right side. There was edema of the arms, with more pronounced swelling in the right arm than in the left arm, as well as erythema on the chest and evidence of engorged veins in the chest wall.
The blood level of glucose was normal, as were the results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia with premature atrial beats, borderline-low precordial lead voltage, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes.
Dr. Subba R. Digumarthy: Chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a persistent large central mass in the right upper lobe with occlusion of the right upper-lobe bronchus and collapse of the right upper lobe. There were multiple enlarged right mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes (Figure 1A). The brachiocephalic veins and the SVC showed no opacification, and the presence of extensive collateral veins in the right chest wall was consistent with venous occlusion and SVC syndrome (Figure 1B and 1C). An incidental cyst was noted in the upper pole of the left kidney. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion. There was no other evidence of cancer in the abdomen. The diagnostic possibilities included non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer, metastasis from extrathoracic cancer, and lymphoma. Granulomatous infection and fibrosing mediastinitis were less likely in this case, given the imaging findings.
FIGURE 1

CT of the Chest.
Angiography performed the next day confirmed that there was no opacification of the subclavian and brachiocephalic veins or the SVC and that extensive collateral veins were present in the arms. After removal of some of the clots, multiple overlapping stents were placed in the internal jugular veins, the brachiocephalic veins, and the SVC (Figure 1D and 1E and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).
Dr. Colleen M. Keyes: On the fourth hospital day, rigid bronchoscopy revealed diffusely friable mucosa and dynamic airway narrowing of the right main-stem bronchus. Much of the airway narrowing appeared to be due to extrinsic compression (Figure 2). Balloon dilation of the airway was performed but did not result in resolution of the airway narrowing; therefore, an endobronchial stent was not placed. Endobronchial ultrasonography revealed a 1.5-cm mass near the carina, and transbronchial needle aspiration was subsequently performed.
FIGURE 2

Photograph Obtained during Bronchoscopy.
Dr. Daniel Shepherd: During fine-needle aspiration of the subcarinal mass, a rapid on-site evaluation of the specimen was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (Figure 3A and 3B) showed clusters of large epithelioid cells with anisonucleosis, irregularly contoured nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and occasional binucleated forms. There was a moderate amount of thin, delicate eosinophilic cytoplasm with occasional intracytoplasmic mucin. These findings are consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. No morphologic features of small-cell carcinoma were seen, and immunohistochemical staining for neuroendocrine markers and for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was negative.

Case 34-2022: A 57-Year-Old Woman with Covid-19 and Delusions,"Dr. Michael D. Kritzer: A 57-year-old woman with major depressive disorder and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was evaluated at a hospital affiliated with this hospital because she was having delusions that she was dead.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 weeks before this presentation, when myalgias, cough, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting developed. She sought evaluation at the primary care clinic of an academic medical center affiliated with this hospital (the two hospitals are part of the same health care system). Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, and the patient was instructed to quarantine at home. She lived with her father and assisted him with activities of daily living; he also received a diagnosis of Covid-19.
During the following week, the patient’s cough persisted, and new shortness of breath developed. Her symptoms worsened; she felt that she was unable to take care of her father. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient and her father were taken to the emergency department of the other hospital, where they were both admitted for worsening Covid-19 pneumonia. The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. Treatment with remdesivir was stopped on hospital day 4 when the blood aminotransferase levels increased to three times the upper limit of the normal range.
During the hospitalization, the patient was noted to have intermittent anxiety, particularly when discharge planning for her father was discussed. She and her brother declined to have their father discharged to a rehabilitation center and instead planned for him to eventually return home to quarantine with the patient. On hospital day 6, the patient’s oxygen saturation was normal while she was breathing ambient air, and the blood aminotransferase levels had improved. She was discharged home with instructions to quarantine and continue taking dexamethasone.
One day after discharge, the patient’s brother spoke to her on the telephone. He thought that she seemed to be confused and unable to take care of herself, and he asked her to return to the emergency department of the other hospital.
On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient explained that she was unsure why her brother had asked her to return to the hospital, and she said that she wanted to go home. She also expressed that she felt anxious about being home alone after discharge and overwhelmed about needing to care for her father at home once he was discharged from the hospital. The myalgias, cough, and shortness of breath had abated; she had no fevers, visual or auditory hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation.
The patient had a history of major depressive disorder, which had been diagnosed during the second decade of life. At the time of diagnosis, she had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and had received electroconvulsive therapy; thereafter, she had been discharged to a partial hospital program. She had been hospitalized for psychiatric symptoms twice since then, once for major depressive disorder and once for a mixed bipolar episode that was due to insomnia and anxious distress. The latter episode was associated with catatonic features and was treated with electroconvulsive therapy.
The patient had no history of suicidal or homicidal ideation or attempts and no history of violence. She had hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included dexamethasone, bupropion, fluoxetine, olanzapine, losartan, metformin, and pantoprazole. Sulfa drugs had caused angioedema, and lisinopril had caused cough. The patient was born in the Caribbean and had emigrated four decades earlier, first to southwestern Europe and then to the United States 2 years later. She lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with her father, who had mild dementia. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit substances.
On examination, the temperature was 37.2°C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 153/95 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented but guarded, with a flat affect. She appeared to be more anxious than she had been during the previous hospitalization. She paced around the room and perseverated about the care of her father. The remainder of the examination was normal.
The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 11,490 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000), with neutrophil predominance; the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Urinalysis and a radiograph of the chest were normal. Treatment with dexamethasone was stopped, and the patient was admitted to the hospital to facilitate discharge to a rehabilitation center for continued care.
On hospital day 3, the patient was noted to be more withdrawn, and she began responding to questions with one-word answers or silence. When she was encouraged to speak more, she continued to perseverate about the care of her father. When she was asked to elaborate on her concerns, she stated, “He is dead. I am dead.”
The patient appeared disheveled, sullen, and anxious. She laid in bed motionless with her eyes open and looking forward, and she responded briefly to questions in a quiet voice with slowed speech. Her thoughts were perseverative and tangential. There was no evidence that she had loosening of associations, hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. She had poor insight and judgment. Memory, attention, concentration, abstract reasoning, and fund of knowledge were normal. When her arms and legs were lifted against gravity and released, they fell to the bed without resistance; with encouragement, she was able to move them. Muscle tone was normal, with no rigidity or waxy flexibility. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Aaron B. Paul: Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of an acute territorial infarct, intracranial mass, or hemorrhage. There was nonspecific moderate confluent hypoattenuation involving the supratentorial white matter.
FIGURE 1

CT of the Head.
Dr. Kritzer: Clonazepam was administered, and the dose of olanzapine was increased. Admission to an inpatient psychiatric unit was recommended. During the next week, while awaiting placement in an inpatient psychiatric unit, the patient continued to show signs of anxiety and a depressed mood. She said, “I am dead. I do not exist. I am not real.” She also believed that her father and brother, as well as her nurses and doctors, were dead. The patient was selectively mute and motionless, but she talked and moved with encouragement. She expressed that she felt directly responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic and asked to be thrown out of the window. She had the sensation that her bladder was gone and that she could not urinate, although she had been observed urinating independently. She felt that she could not eat, although she had been observed eating breakfast daily. On hospital day 9, the patient was transferred to the inpatient psychiatric unit of the other hospital.
A diagnosis and management decisions were made.","Cotard’s syndrome, catatonia, depression, and seizure after coronavirus disease 2019."
Case 33-2022: An 11-Year-Old Girl with Redness of the Eyes,"Dr. Natalie A. Diacovo (Pediatrics): An 11-year-old girl was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of redness of the eyes.
The patient had been well until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when she noticed mild eye redness, which was worse in the right eye than in the left eye. There was intermittent swelling of the eyelids but no photophobia, itching, pain, tearing, or discharge. The patient’s parents administered naphazoline hydrochloride and glycerin eye drops, but the eye redness did not abate. When the eye redness had persisted for 2 weeks, the patient was taken to the pediatrics clinic of another hospital. She was given a 7-day course of an oral antibiotic agent as empirical treatment for possible preseptal cellulitis.
Five weeks before the current evaluation, the eye redness persisted despite treatment, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital. The blood pressure was not measured during this evaluation. The visual acuity with correction was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination revealed abundant white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were also keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and rare iris nodules in the right eye. Funduscopic examination was notable for optic-disk swelling and peripheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes, as well as perivascular exudates in the right eye. Cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes were prescribed.
During the subsequent 3 weeks, additional tests were performed in the pediatrics clinic of the other hospital. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, syphilis, and Lyme disease were negative. An interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was indeterminate. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the chest revealed hilar fullness.

However, diffuse lymphadenopathy was detected in the mediastinum, upper abdomen, and axillae, with the largest lymph node measuring 2.0 cm by 1.3 cm by 1.8 cm.
FIGURE 1

Initial Imaging Studies.
Dr. Diacovo: Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient was asked to present to the emergency department of the other hospital for an expedited workup. On evaluation, she described eye redness that had persisted but decreased in severity. She reported no fever, weight loss, night sweats, rash, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or joint pain. On examination, the temperature was 37.0°C, the blood pressure 96/61 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.3.
The patient appeared well, with no oral lesions or rash. The visual acuity was unchanged. Slit-lamp examination revealed keratic precipitates and white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were extensive posterior synechiae in the right eye. Funduscopic examination (Figure 2) showed vitreous white cells, optic-disk swelling, perivascular exudates, peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital.
FIGURE 2

Fundus Photographs.
During the next 4 days, additional tests were performed, and sputum specimens were obtained for an acid-fast bacilli smear and culture. Optical coherence tomography revealed optic-disk swelling but no cystoid macular swelling. Fluorescein angiography revealed optic-disk leakage with areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion and some vessel leakage.
Dr. Figueiro Longo: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1C), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed protrusion and enhancement of the optic disks and enhancement of the irises, a finding consistent with the clinical diagnosis of uveitis. There was no evidence of optic neuritis or perineuritis.
Dr. Diacovo: The administration of cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes was continued. Treatment with oral prednisone was started, and a regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was begun as empirical treatment for possible tuberculosis. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. She was instructed to follow up in the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital and was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital.
In the rheumatology clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient had had normal growth and development and was currently in middle school. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had emigrated from West Africa to the United States 6 years earlier; since then, she had lived with her mother and father in a suburban town in New England and had not traveled outside the region. Six months before this evaluation, an interferon-γ release assay for M. tuberculosis had been positive. At that time, the patient had received a prescription for a medication to treat latent tuberculosis infection; however, the patient’s parents could not recall giving the medication to the patient. She was taking the prescribed cyclopentolate and prednisolone eye drops, oral prednisone, and regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient’s parents were healthy.
A diagnosis and management decisions were made.",Sarcoidosis
Case 32-2022: A 76-Year-Old Man with Postoperative Cardiogenic Shock and Diffuse Rash,"Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 76-year-old man was evaluated in the intensive care unit of this hospital for persistent postoperative cardiogenic shock and new diffuse rash after undergoing mitral-valve replacement.
Two months before this evaluation, the patient was admitted to another hospital with anorexia, generalized weakness, fatigue, and edema. Examination of the lungs was notable for decreased breath sounds and basilar crackles. The level of N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide was 15,895 pg per milliliter (reference value, <1500).
Dr. Matthew T. Stib: A chest radiograph (Figure 1A) showed a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette, as well as evidence of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
FIGURE 1

Cardiac and Radiographic Studies.
Dr. Dudzinski: At the other hospital, intravenous furosemide was administered. Blood cultures obtained at the time of admission grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in four of four bottles. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) reportedly revealed moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and a 7-mm vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Treatment with intravenous oxacillin was initiated; a 4-week course of treatment was planned, after which the patient was scheduled for follow-up in the cardiac surgery clinic at this hospital.
However, 3 weeks after discharge, the patient reported dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, progressive edema of the legs, and weight gain of 7 kg. He was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.
Medical history was notable for hypertension, right bundle-branch block, hypothyroidism, and prostatism, as well as atrial fibrillation, for which the patient had undergone cardioversion. Surgical history included tooth extraction for a painful dental abscess 6 weeks before admission to the other hospital, appendectomy, arthroplasty of the left hip after a fall 3 years earlier, and repair of a meniscus tear in the left knee. Medications included oxacillin administered intravenously every 4 hours and oral furosemide, sotalol, rivaroxaban, levothyroxine, and tamsulosin. He had had no known adverse drug reactions.
The patient was retired and lived with his spouse. He reported that, before his admission to the other hospital, he had been riding a bicycle a few miles several times per week. He had previously smoked cigarettes but had quit 30 years earlier; he consumed one beer weekly and used no other substances. His family history was notable for atrial fibrillation.
The temperature was 36.7°C, the heart rate 83 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued. The jugular venous pressure was elevated, at 15 cm of water. The cardiac impulse was discrete and was not displaced. Auscultation of the chest revealed an irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm, with a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex that did not change with respiration, and bibasilar crackles. There was 2+ pitting edema in the legs. A peripherally inserted central catheter was present in the right arm.
The blood levels of calcium, magnesium, albumin, lipase, glycated hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, and a screening test for human immunodeficiency virus antigen and antibodies was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of blood were obtained. An electrocardiogram (Figure 1B) showed atrial fibrillation, multifocal ventricular premature beats, and right bundle-branch block.

Dr. Stib: A chest radiograph (Figure 1C) showed bilateral pulmonary edema, which was more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung, as well as pleural effusions and left atrial enlargement. The tip of a peripherally inserted central catheter was appropriately positioned in the lower superior vena cava.
Dr. Dudzinski: Treatment with intravenous oxacillin and furosemide was continued. TEE (Figure 1D) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a normal-sized left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 61%, dilatation of the right ventricle with normal function, dilatation of both atria, mitral-valve perforation and thickening, severe mitral regurgitation due to mitral-valve perforation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with a right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg (also see Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Coronary angiography revealed 70% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and 90% stenosis in the middle right coronary artery.
On hospital day 11, cardiac surgery was performed. The patient underwent bioprosthetic mitral-valve replacement, along with two-vessel coronary-artery bypass grafting and amputation of the left atrial appendage. TEE performed after the surgical procedure revealed a well-seated mitral prosthesis with trace central regurgitation, as well as mild biventricular systolic dysfunction. Subsequently, on transfer to the intensive care unit, the blood pressure was 108/52 mm Hg and the cardiac index 3.0 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area while the patient was receiving epinephrine (at a rate of 2 μg per minute), norepinephrine (10 μg per minute), and vasopressin (0.04 U per minute). An electrocardiogram (Figure 1E) showed atrial fibrillation, right bundle-branch block, and ventricular premature beats. During postoperative day 1, the patient had increased ventricular ectopy and a 25-beat run of ventricular tachycardia. Laboratory and hemodynamic data are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Stib: An anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure 1F) showed left atrial enlargement, bilateral pulmonary edema, and basilar atelectasis, along with sternotomy wires, an endotracheal tube, a catheter in the right main pulmonary artery, bilateral chest tubes, and a mediastinal drain.
Dr. Dudzinski: Treatment with intravenous amiodarone was started, and the epinephrine infusion was discontinued.
On postoperative day 2, the trachea was extubated, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued. The cardiac index had decreased to less than 2.0 liters per minute per square meter, and intravenous milrinone was initiated. The next day, a 35-beat run of ventricular tachycardia occurred. On postoperative day 4, given that the cardiac index was less than 1.9 liters per minute per square meter, intravenous dopamine was started. On postoperative day 5, deep-vein thrombosis was identified in the right lower leg, and treatment with warfarin was started. A truncal macular rash was noted. TTE revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 32%, right ventricular dysfunction, atrial dilatation, trace central prosthetic mitral regurgitation with a mean transmitral gradient of 5 mm Hg measured at 70 beats per minute, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (see Video 3). There was also worsening renal function. Milrinone was stopped and epinephrine initiated.
On postoperative day 8, microbiologic cultures obtained during the surgical procedure showed no growth; the patient’s oxacillin treatment was switched to cefazolin. During the next few days, the rash became more confluent and extended to the face, back, arms, and neck in addition to the trunk, but there was no mucosal involvement. Examination of the joints was normal, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. The arms and legs were cool, and urine output had decreased, despite continued therapy with intravenous epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Repeat TTE on postoperative day 13 revealed borderline left ventricular dilatation with an ejection fraction of 37%, right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Additional diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.",Eosinophilic myocarditis and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).
Case 31-2022: A 72-Year-Old Man,"Dr. Yousef R. Badran: A 72-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of heartburn, nausea, and the inability to eat solid and liquid food.
The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The symptoms had been well controlled with the use of daily omeprazole therapy until 11 months before this admission, when heartburn recurred despite treatment. At that time, the patient also noticed nausea after eating and early satiation. During the next 9 months, the heartburn and nausea slowly increased in severity. To help manage his symptoms, the patient adjusted his diet from solid food to soft solid food.
Two months before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at the gastroenterology clinic of another hospital. The glycated hemoglobin level was 6.1% (reference range, 4.3 to 5.6). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. Although the patient had not eaten food for 24 hours before the procedure, the stomach could not be adequately visualized because there was a large amount of residual food; no intraluminal masses were seen.
A scintigraphy study of gastric emptying was performed. During the study, 88% of the gastric contents were retained at 1 hour, 88% at 2 hours, 81% at 3 hours, and 80% at 4 hours. In a patient with normal gastric emptying, less than 60% of the gastric contents would be retained at 2 hours and less than 10% at 4 hours. Thus, the results were consistent with severely delayed gastric emptying. The patient was told that he had idiopathic gastroparesis and underwent trials of several medications. Ondansetron caused constipation, erythromycin caused burning while swallowing and abdominal cramping, and metoclopramide and scopolamine did not lead to a decrease in the patient’s symptoms.
During the 2 months after the evaluation in the gastroenterology clinic, the patient adjusted his diet from soft solid food to blended solid food. Two weeks before this admission, he adjusted his diet to primarily liquid food, such as nutritional supplement drinks, protein shakes, and ice cream. When the patient was no longer able to drink liquids, he sought evaluation at the emergency department of the other hospital.
On evaluation, the patient described epigastric burning and nausea after eating. He had lost 13.6 kg of weight in the preceding year, including 5.4 kg in the past 2 weeks. He had no recent history of illness, night sweats, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.
Dr. David A. Rosman: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a patulous esophagus, along with wall thickening in scattered areas of the upper and lower segments of the esophagus. There was abnormal circumferential wall thickening (≤13 mm) in the stomach, particularly at the antrum, incisura, and pyloric canal (Figure 1). The antrum was decompressed or nonexpansile, and the rest of the stomach was distended. There were multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules (≤5 mm in diameter) and multiple hepatic hypodensities (<10 mm in diameter), as well as a pancreatic cyst (5 mm in diameter) and an exophytic renal lesion (8 mm in diameter).
FIGURE 1

CT Scan of the Abdomen.
Dr. Badran: A nasogastric tube was inserted. Treatment with intravenous pantoprazole was started, and intravenous lorazepam was administered for nausea. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.
During the subsequent week, the patient received vitamin and mineral supplements for severe malnutrition. He remained unable to drink liquids. On the 7th hospital day, a peripherally inserted central catheter was placed, and total parenteral nutrition was administered. The patient was monitored for refeeding syndrome. On the 15th hospital day, he was transferred to this hospital for further treatment.
On transfer to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had a history of prediabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diverticulosis, glaucoma, and basal cell carcinoma of the ear that had been resected. Five years before this admission, EGD had revealed a widely patent Schatzki’s ring, an irregular-appearing Z line, and a few gastric polyps; examination of an esophageal biopsy specimen had revealed no abnormalities. Colonoscopy had shown two tubular adenomas. The patient had undergone orthognathic surgery, but there was no history of abdominal surgery. Medications included omeprazole, lisinopril, atorvastatin, vitamin D supplements, and bimatoprost and bromonidine eye drops. Sulfa drugs had caused a rash.
The patient lived with his wife in a rural area of New England. He had previously served in the military and currently worked as a biotechnologist. He had never smoked tobacco, and he drank alcohol rarely. His mother and paternal aunt had died of colon cancer, his father of lung cancer, his maternal grandmother of breast cancer, and his maternal grandfather of prostate cancer. His two children and two grandchildren were healthy.
On examination, the temperature was 37.7°C, the blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was thin and had a nasogastric tube in place. He had normal mood, affect, and insight. The abdomen was flat, soft, and nondistended, with mild tenderness in the epigastrium on palpation. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Distal sensory and motor function were normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Case 30-2022: A Newborn Girl with Hypoglycemia,"Dr. Numa P. Perez (Surgery): A newborn girl was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital because of hypoglycemia.
The patient’s mother was a 27-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 1) who had received prenatal care at another hospital. At 34 weeks of gestation, an ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy had reportedly revealed an avascular intraabdominal cystic mass that was located near the bladder and measured 3.7 cm by 2.1 cm by 2.0 cm. A sacral dimple was noted. The patient’s mother was referred to the maternal–fetal medicine clinic of the other hospital; she declined follow-up imaging and amniocentesis.
At 37 weeks 6 days of gestation, premature labor occurred, and the patient’s mother was taken to a second hospital. A fetal heart tracing was noted to be nonreactive with minimal variability. The fetal biophysical profile score was 4 out of 8, indicating decreased breathing motion and body movement but normal tone and amniotic fluid volume. An emergency cesarean section was performed.
On delivery, the newborn had limp tone and poor respiratory effort. The birth weight was 2963 g (19th percentile), the length 48 cm (20th percentile), and the head circumference 35 cm (77th percentile). The Apgar scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes were 7 and 9, respectively. The patient was transferred to the newborn nursery.
In the nursery, the patient was noted to be jittery. Oxygen therapy was administered through a low-flow nasal cannula. The blood glucose level was reportedly less than 10 mg per deciliter (0.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]) and the bilirubin level 16.0 mg per deciliter (274 μmol per liter; reference range, 2.0 to 15.0 mg per deciliter [34 to 257 μmol per liter]). A chest radiograph showed a normal cardiac shadow and findings indicative of retained fetal lung fluid. The newborn was fed, and a bolus of dextrose was administered; however, a repeat blood glucose level was 2 mg per deciliter (0.1 mmol per liter). A continuous infusion of dextrose was started. Phototherapy and empirical treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin were administered.
During the next 3 days, the patient’s blood glucose level remained low, with a maximum level of 61 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter), even though the glucose infusion rate was increased and enteral feeding with formula was initiated. On the fourth day of life, she was transferred to the neonatal ICU of this hospital for further treatment.
On admission to the neonatal ICU, additional history was obtained. Before the ultrasonographic survey at 34 weeks of gestation, the pregnancy had been normal. The patient’s mother had taken prenatal vitamins. Prenatal maternal screening had been negative for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, as well as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and group B streptococcal infections; there was evidence of immunity to rubella virus. The maternal ABO blood type was AB, Rh positive. The newborn’s parents had immigrated to the United States from the Caribbean and now lived in a suburb in New England. The patient’s mother, father, and half brother were healthy.
On examination, the patient was alert and appeared comfortable. The temperature was 36.9°C, the heart rate 148 beats per minute, the blood pressure 79/45 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 49 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The anterior and posterior fontanelles were flat and soft. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft without distention, tenderness, or palpable masses. Two sacral dimples with visible bases were noted. The female genitalia appeared normal, but the anus was displaced anteriorly.
The blood glucose level was 60 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter) while the patient was receiving dextrose at a glucose infusion rate of 10.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute. The total bilirubin level was 20.4 mg per deciliter (349 μmol per liter). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Sjirk J. Westra: A chest radiograph showed clear lungs. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography (Figure 1) revealed a large solid–cystic mass anterior to the sacrum that measured 2.7 cm by 3.0 cm by 5.7 cm, with the rectum passing anteriorly to the mass. Results of spinal ultrasonography were normal, as were results of cranial ultrasonography performed through the anterior fontanelle. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen, pelvis, and spine (Figure 2) showed a presacral solid–cystic mass that measured 2.7 cm by 2.8 cm by 5.9 cm, with a small extension into the ischiorectal fossa on the right side. There was no evidence of abdominal lymphadenopathy or involvement of the sacral spine.

Dr. Perez: During the next few days, the patient continued to receive dextrose at a high glucose infusion rate to maintain normoglycemia. At 5 days of life, a small bowel movement occurred. The blood lactate dehydrogenase level was 1173 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210) and the beta human chorionic gonadotropin level 10.7 mIU per milliliter (reference range, <1.1).
A diagnostic test was performed.",Neonatal hypoglycemia due to biologically active teratoma and the Sotos syndrome.
Case 29-2022: A 33-Year-Old Man with Chronic Diarrhea and Autoimmune Enteropathy,"Dr. Dilara Hatipoglu (Medicine): A 33-year-old man was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of relapsing chronic diarrhea and a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy.
Diarrhea had initially developed in the patient during infancy. When the patient was 2 months of age, he had poor growth and frequent bowel movements with loose stools. When he began to eat solid foods, diarrhea continued, and a hydrolyzed-protein diet was started. His parents were instructed to remove dairy, soy, and gluten from his diet, but diarrhea did not abate. Allergy skin-prick testing with cow’s milk and soy antigens was negative.
When the patient was 10 months of age, failure to thrive and diarrhea persisted, and generalized edema and nephrotic syndrome developed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and diffuse inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy reportedly showed mild degenerative changes of the surface epithelium and mild focal microvillous atrophy; there were no immune deposits, and the basement membrane was normal.
Renal biopsy was also performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen revealed glomeruli with diffuse thickening of the basement membrane; there was no proliferation of cells or mesangial matrix. Transmission electron microscopy showed total effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes and an irregularly thickened glomerular basement membrane with numerous subepithelial and intramembranous electron-dense deposits. The patient received a working diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome due to membranous glomerulonephritis, and treatment with prednisone was started.
Diarrhea abated, proteinuria and generalized edema resolved, and growth resumed. However, during the next 2 years, intermittent relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome occurred when the dose of prednisone was decreased. When the patient was 3 years of age, treatment with chlorambucil was started for recurrent membranous glomerulonephritis, and there were no relapses for 1 year.
When the patient was 4 years of age, there was a recurrence of diarrhea associated with fever and hemolytic anemia. Stool culture, stool testing for Clostridioides difficile toxin, and examination of the stool for ova and parasites were all negative. EGD was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and active enteritis. The blood IgE level was 501 IU per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 100). The blood level of endomysial antibodies was not elevated, but anti–epithelial cell antibodies were detected. The patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy, and treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was begun.
After several months, treatment with glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was stopped, and tacrolimus was begun. Tacrolimus was stopped after several years, when the patient’s symptoms resolved. From 5 to 13 years of age, he had no enteropathy, anemia, or nephropathy.
Beginning at 13 years of age, the patient was hospitalized for recurrences of diarrhea and nephropathy every 2 to 4 years during the 20 years before this evaluation. Six years before this evaluation, EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the duodenal and colonic mucosa appeared diffusely edematous. Biopsy specimens were obtained.
Dr. Stuti G. Shroff: Examination of a duodenal biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed marked villous blunting, an increase in lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria (known as lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria), and a patchy increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. Examination of a colonic biopsy specimen revealed mild focal active colitis that spared the rectum.
FIGURE 1

Small-Intestinal Biopsy Specimens.
Dr. Hatipoglu: Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was begun, and diarrhea abated. For the next 2 years, relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone in combination with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil.
Four years before this evaluation, antibodies against the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor were not detected. Renal biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen again revealed evidence of membranous glomerulonephritis. Treatment was changed to prednisone, budesonide, and abatacept, and symptoms abated. After 2 years, the patient stopped taking abatacept. After another 2 years, diarrhea recurred, and the patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital.
In the gastroenterology clinic, additional history was obtained. There was a history of hypertension, gallstones, and rosacea. Eczema had developed when the patient was 10 months of age and had occurred intermittently into adulthood; it had abated with the administration of immunosuppressive agents. Anaphylactic shock had occurred when the patient was 2 years of age after he had been exposed to uncooked egg. At that time, allergy testing was performed, and the patient’s parents were instructed to remove eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, and shellfish from his diet, in addition to removing dairy, soy, and gluten.
Current medications included prednisone, budesonide, and losartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a Mid-Atlantic state and worked as a salesperson. He did not smoke tobacco and drank beer rarely. His family history included ovarian cancer in his mother and skin cancer in his father; his brother was healthy.
On examination, the temperature was 37.0°C, the blood pressure 131/94 mm Hg, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.1. The patient had short stature and diffuse erythema of the face and neck. There was mild tenderness in the left lower abdomen. The results of a lactulose breath test were normal, as was the fecal calprotectin level. Testing for antibodies to tissue transglutaminase was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the findings were consistent with duodenitis, gastritis, and atrophy of the colon. Biopsy specimens were obtained.

Case 28-2022: A 59-Year-Old Man with Headache and Progressive Neurologic Dysfunction,"Dr. John H. Stone: A 59-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of headache and progressive neurologic dysfunction.
Ten months before this evaluation, daily fever with a temperature of up to 38.9°C, chills, myalgias, drenching night sweats, and pressure and pain in both cheeks and ears developed. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported rhinorrhea and fatigue but no headache, pharyngitis, or dyspnea, and he had no sick contacts. On examination, the temperature was 37.8°C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/64 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was ill-appearing, and the maxillary sinuses were tender on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 463,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 400,000); the remainder of the complete blood count and the differential count were normal. Amoxicillin–clavulanate was prescribed.
During the next 2 weeks, fever, night sweats, and sinus and facial pain continued. Diffuse headache developed, along with jaw soreness, scalp tenderness, and hip and shoulder stiffness. The patient was evaluated again by his primary care physician. He reported weight loss of 2 kg, episodic double vision, and hip pain that caused difficulty in standing and climbing stairs. The physical examination was unchanged. Urinalysis was normal. A test for heterophile antibody and an interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative, as were screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus and Lyme disease. Chest radiography and computed tomography of the sinuses were normal. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist at another hospital.
On evaluation, the patient reported persistent fever and frontal, temporal, and maxillary headache. There were palpable temporal artery pulses without tenderness; the remainder of the examination was normal, including the absence of bruits on auscultation of large vessels. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 108 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), the blood level of C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), the blood level of rheumatoid factor 24 IU per milliliter (reference value, <14), and the blood level of aldolase 8.4 IU per milliliter (reference value, <8.1). Biopsy of the right temporal artery was performed. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed no granulomas, but evidence of chronic inflammation of the temporal artery and fibrinoid necrosis of an adjacent small vessel were noted.
A diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis was made, and treatment with prednisone was started. Within a few days after initiation of treatment, headache, fever, jaw pain, and joint stiffness abated. The next month, an attempt to lower the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent severe headache with scalp tenderness, jaw pain, and hip stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 84 mg per liter. Treatment with weekly subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab was initiated.
During the next 6 weeks, another attempt was made to taper the prednisone dose. After 1 week of treatment at a lower prednisone dose, and 5 months after the development of initial symptoms (5 months before the current evaluation), the patient reported headache that he described as “the worst headache of my life,” with associated jaw pain and diplopia. The pain was worst at the right frontal and maxillary areas, but the entire right side of the face, including the scalp and neck, was affected. The patient returned to the other hospital for evaluation. He was found to have palsies of the third and sixth cranial nerves on the right side. The patient was admitted to the neurology service at the other hospital. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing revealed a slightly elevated myeloperoxidase antibody level, at 1.9 U (reference value, <1.0), but antibodies to proteinase 3 were not detected. Blood levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Otto Rapalino: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed abnormal expansion and enhancement of the right cavernous sinus that extended into the right superior orbital fissure and right pterygopalatine fossa, as well as abnormal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement of the adjacent right middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Figure 1C and 1D) showed masslike pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement in the upper cervical spinal canal at C2–C4 with an anterior predominance as well as more circumferentially at the cervicothoracic junction (C6–T3) with a posterior predominance, with resultant canal narrowing and mild cord compression at C7–T2. There was no spinal cord edema.
FIGURE 1

MRI of the Head and Spine Obtained 5 Months before the Current Evaluation.
Dr. John Stone: A lumbar puncture was performed; an opening pressure was not recorded. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose level was 65 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 80 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.4 mmol per liter]), and the protein level was 126 mg per deciliter (reference range, 15 to 45), with 2 red cells per microliter and 8 white cells per microliter (of which 79% were lymphocytes). Gram’s staining and cultures of the CSF were negative. Tests for CSF myelin basic protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme, cryptococcal antigen, cysticercosis IgG, mycobacterial DNA, Epstein–Barr virus DNA, and borrelia DNA were negative, as was a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. Cytologic analysis of the CSF showed a mixed population of mononuclear cells with rare plasma cells. The CSF immunoglobulin level was 19 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0 to 6), with 5 oligoclonal bands.
On the eighth hospital day, a meningeal biopsy was performed. Treatment with high-dose prednisone was started, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 2 weeks, the patient continued taking the prednisone, but the facial and head pain worsened. He was readmitted to the other hospital to receive 3 days of treatment with parenteral pulse-dose methylprednisolone.
Pathological examination of the meningeal biopsy specimen revealed a densely fibrotic, chronically inflamed dura mater with large numbers of CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ T lymphocytes and with focal collections of CD20+ B lymphocytes. There was a large number of polyclonal plasma cells with more than 100 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-power field. Storiform fibrosis was present, and elastin staining revealed obliterative venulitis. Some of the inflammatory foci were angiocentric, but no vasculitis was present. There were rare foci of fibrinoid necrosis and some neutrophils, with rare giant cells but no granulomas. A diagnosis of IgG4-related disease was made, and rituximab was administered. Two days after the first rituximab dose, a pulmonary embolism was diagnosed, and treatment with apixaban was initiated. Two weeks later, repeat imaging was obtained to evaluate the treatment response.
Dr. Rapalino: Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased abnormal enhancement in the right cavernous sinus and right middle cranial fossa and new abnormal enhancement in the left cavernous sinus and adjacent left middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Figure 2C and 2D) also showed progression in the extent and thickness of the ventral and dorsal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement. There was also progression of the canal stenosis, which had become severe, and cord compression at the C7 level. There was no cord signal abnormality.
FIGURE 2

MRI of the Head and Spine Obtained 4 Months before the Current Evaluation.
Dr. John Stone: The patient received a second infusion of rituximab, as well as treatment with oral dexamethasone. Three weeks later, and 7 months after the development of initial symptoms (3 months before the current evaluation), the patient was admitted to the other hospital because of worsening headache, nausea, and vomiting. Examination was notable for new sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and deviation of the tongue to the left. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Treatment with dexamethasone was continued, and the patient was discharged home. Three weeks after placement of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the patient was admitted again to the other hospital because of streptococcal infection. Two months after discharge, and 10 months after the development of initial symptoms, he was seen in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation.
The patient had a history of migraines, hypertension, and a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. Medications included apixaban, baclofen, dexamethasone, furosemide, gabapentin, lisinopril, and metoprolol. He was a retired businessman and lived with his wife. He drank one glass of wine weekly and had quit smoking more than 40 years before the current evaluation. His maternal grandfather had died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm.
The temperature was 36.5°C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 118/79 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The scalp hair was thin. He had cushingoid facies; acne on the face, back, and chest; striae on the flanks; and proximal muscle weakness of the arms and legs. There was no scalp or temporal tenderness. He had no tongue lesions or oral ulcers, and the nasal examination showed no crusting. Extraocular movements were intact. There was no arthritis. The chest, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were normal. The complete blood count and the differential count were normal, as was a urinalysis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 52 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 5 mg per liter. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed an IgM level of 22 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334) and normal levels of IgG and IgA. ANCA testing was negative.
A diagnosis and management decisions were made.",Granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
"Case 27-2022: A 32-Year-Old Man with Confusion, Headache, and Fever","Dr. Javier A. Suarez (Neurology): A 32-year-old man was admitted to this hospital after 2 weeks of confusion and headache and 2 days of fever.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 month before admission, when his wife noted that he began to have behavior suggestive of anxiety. Two weeks before admission, his wife noted that he began to have confusion; for example, he was unable to recall the ages of his children or to correctly identify the date. At that time, headache and neck stiffness developed. Two days before admission, fever developed. On the day of admission, the patient had worsening confusion and somnolence, and his wife brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
On presentation, the patient was not able to provide any history but was accompanied by his wife, who described his recent symptoms. His medical record showed a 10-year history of Behçet’s disease, which had initially been complicated by oral and genital ulcers and intermittent fever. During the following decade, flares of Behçet’s disease had been associated with various manifestations: pulmonary embolism, iliac artery aneurysm and dissection, bilateral renal vein thrombosis, erythema nodosum, deep venous thrombosis, uveitis, an inferior vena cava clot complicated by superior vena cava syndrome that led to thrombectomy, and renal infarction. The flares of Behçet’s disease had usually included oral ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, or fever.
Past treatment for Behçet’s disease had included azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Two years before this presentation, treatment with azathioprine and cyclosporine was discontinued and adalimumab initiated. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone resulted in flares of genital and oral ulcers. The frequency of adalimumab administration was increased to weekly, but genital and oral ulcers persisted. Thirteen months before this presentation, treatment with adalimumab was stopped and infliximab initiated. Diffuse arthralgias developed that were attributed to infliximab. Twelve months before this presentation, treatment with infliximab was stopped and golimumab initiated.
Other medical history included an episode of lymphocyte-predominant meningitis, which had been diagnosed during an evaluation for headache, fever, and neck pain 17 months before this presentation. During the episode, there was a 72-hour delay in performing lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis because the patient had been taking apixaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. While he was awaiting lumbar puncture, broad-spectrum antibiotic agents were administered, and the headache, fever, and neck pain resolved. CSF analysis revealed normal levels of glucose and total protein, no red cells, and a nucleated-cell count of 88 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 97% lymphocytes and 3% monocytes. Nucleic acid amplification testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was negative, and Gram’s staining revealed no organisms. Antimicrobial therapy was discontinued, and the patient was discharged home.
There was also a history of coronavirus disease 2019, which had been diagnosed 16 months before this presentation. Current medications included golimumab, apixaban, prednisone, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. There were no known allergies. The patient lived with his wife and four children. He had previously worked in construction; he had been released from prison 3 months before this presentation and was not currently working. He had a remote history of smoking tobacco; he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His grandmother had hypertension.
On examination in the emergency department, the patient was somnolent but arose in response to verbal stimuli. His level of alertness fluctuated, he was only intermittently able to answer simple questions, and he could not provide a coherent history of his illness. The temperature was 39.5°C, the blood pressure 122/71 mm Hg, the heart rate 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.7. He was oriented to person and place but not to time. There was no neck stiffness. Mild injection in the left eye was present, but there were no oral or skin lesions. The patient was not able to participate fully in a neurologic examination, but he was able to move his arms and legs; no focal neurologic findings were noted on observation. The remainder of the examination was normal.
Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were results of liver-function, kidney-function, and coagulation tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The blood acetaminophen level was less than 5.0 μg per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 25.0); blood testing for ethanol was negative. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for respiratory viral pathogens was positive for human rhinovirus or enterovirus. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. Imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed mucosal thickening with layering fluid levels in both maxillary sinuses, but the study was otherwise normal. CT angiography of the head and neck, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed normal arterial and venous vasculature.
Dr. Suarez: Treatment with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with apixaban was stopped and heparin administered intravenously in anticipation of performing a lumbar puncture. Fever and headache abated, but the patient’s mental status did not improve. Blood cultures showed no growth. On the fourth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was not obtained. CSF analysis revealed a normal total protein level, a glucose level of 40 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), a red-cell count of 2 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and a nucleated-cell count of 284 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 72% lymphocytes, 13% neutrophils, 11% monocytes, and 4% unclassified cells. Nucleic acid amplification testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was negative, and Gram’s staining revealed no organisms. No acid-fast bacilli were observed on a mycobacterial smear, and no fungi were seen on examination of a fungal wet preparation. Testing of the CSF for cryptococcal antigen and enterovirus RNA was negative.
Additional diagnostic testing was performed, and a diagnosis was made.",Encephalitis due to Behçet’s disease.
Case 26-2022: A 48-Year-Old Woman with Cystic Lung Disease,"Dr. Esra D. Gumuser (Medicine): A 48-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of multiple lung and liver lesions identified during an evaluation for abdominal pain.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 10 days before this admission, when burning epigastric pain developed after she ate a meal. Nausea and vomiting occurred 1 hour later; there was no diarrhea. After the pain persisted for 8 hours, she presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.
On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 136/94 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The abdomen was soft but distended; there was diffuse mild tenderness on palpation, without rebound or guarding. The white-cell count was 12,800 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000) and the blood lipase level 147 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The pain did not resolve after treatment with intravenous famotidine and oral simethicone. Imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Melissa C. Price: A chest radiograph showed faint nodular opacities in the lungs, predominantly in the upper lobes. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple fluid-filled small-bowel loops with associated mild mesenteric edema and trace ascites. There was no biliary dilatation. In addition, there were numerous hypoattenuating hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement.
Dr. Gumuser: The patient was admitted to the other hospital with a diagnosis of possible small-bowel obstruction and pneumonia. Treatment with intravenous fluids and ceftriaxone, oral doxycycline, and bowel rest was initiated. On the second hospital day, additional imaging studies of the liver were obtained.
Dr. Price: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen (Figure 1), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilobar hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement, high T2 signal, and diffusion restriction.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Gumuser: Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture, and treatment with intravenous metronidazole was initiated. On the third hospital day, the abdominal pain had resolved, and the patient began drinking clear fluids. On the fourth hospital day, ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was performed. While the results of the liver biopsy were pending, the patient resumed a normal diet, with no recurrence of abdominal pain. Treatment with oral doxycycline and intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole was continued.
Dr. Price: On the sixth hospital day, CT of the chest (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed numerous irregular cysts and cavitary nodules in the lungs, which were most pronounced in the upper lobes, as well as solid and subsolid parenchymal nodules that measured less than 1.0 cm in diameter. There were multiple nodules in the thyroid gland, measuring up to 2.8 cm in diameter in the inferior left thyroid lobe. There was a 1.7-cm nodule with soft-tissue attenuation in the right breast.
Dr. Gumuser: On the eighth hospital day, bronchoscopy was performed. The airways were inspected to the segmental level, and no abnormalities were visualized. Transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in the right upper lobe. Examination of the BAL fluid revealed 321 white cells per microliter (reference range, 94 to 175). Gram’s staining and examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear of the BAL fluid were negative.
On the ninth hospital day, results of the liver biopsy became available, showing extensive eosinophilic infiltration of the liver parenchyma with associated moderate steatosis. Staining of the biopsy specimen for microorganisms, including mycobacteria, was negative. Cultures of blood obtained on the second hospital day showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further care.
On arrival, the patient reported a mild sore throat that had developed after bronchoscopy, but there was no abdominal pain. She had lost 2 kg of weight before the hospitalization, in the context of dietary changes. She had no history of fever but reported a several-year history of mild shortness of breath with walking that she attributed to smoking. Her surgical history included cholecystectomy and cesarean section. Results of a Papanicolaou test performed 3 months before this presentation had been normal; the patient had not undergone mammography or colonoscopy. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies.
The patient lived in an urban area of New England. She was born in Portugal and had immigrated to the United States 40 years earlier. She had not traveled recently; her last trip had been to Portugal 25 years before this admission. The patient was divorced, lived alone, and worked in a medical laboratory. She had no known exposure to chemicals or dust; a coworker at a previous office job had had an atypical infection attributed to mold in the workplace. She had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. She drank alcohol three times a week and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from colon cancer at 43 years of age.
On examination, the temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 130/64 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was normal.
A diagnosis was made.",Langerhans-cell histiocytosis of the lung and liver.
Case 25-2022: A 25-Year-Old Woman with Headache and Blurred Vision,"Dr. Victoria Clark (Neurosurgery): A 25-year-old woman with a history of migraines was admitted to this hospital with progressively worsening headaches and photophobia during the previous 6 weeks and a 1-week history of nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision.
Six weeks before this admission, the patient began to have headaches that were not characteristic of her previous migraines. She described these headaches as discomfort in the middle of her head that was associated with photophobia, phonophobia, and tinnitus. She reported that she was occasionally awakened from sleep because of headache and that the headache was always present on awakening in the morning. The headache was worse with coughing and abated with standing; treatment with ibuprofen did not reduce the discomfort.
One week before admission, nausea and vomiting developed, along with blurred vision when the patient looked to the left. She also reported occasional episodes of total vision loss that lasted for several seconds. When she was unable to eat food because of worsening nausea and vomiting, she presented to another hospital for evaluation. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles with hypodensity that involved the dorsal brain stem and cerebellar hemispheres (Figure 1A); a possible soft-tissue mass in the region of the fourth ventricular outlet was also observed. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies of the Head and Spine.
On arrival, the patient reported ongoing headache and nausea. Other medical history included obesity and opioid use disorder, which was treated with oral buprenorphine–naloxone and was complicated by relapses with injection of heroin; she last injected heroin 1 month before admission. Other medications included ibuprofen as needed. She had no known allergies. She smoked a half pack of cigarettes daily and did not drink alcohol. The patient lived in a wooded area of New England with four cats and one dog. She spent time outside, although she had become less active owing to headache. She was sexually active with one male partner and had no history of sexually transmitted infections. She had not traveled outside of New England. She had had periods of homelessness in the past, but she had not stayed in shelters. She had been incarcerated 2 years before this admission. She did not eat uncooked meat or seafood. Two paternal family members had had ovarian cancer.
On examination, the patient was alert, interactive, and did not appear to be in distress. The temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 117/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 42.6. There were track marks on the legs. The patient was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. On bedside visual field testing, she reported decreased vision in the peripheral fields and double vision on looking to the far left, which was accompanied by a left sixth-nerve palsy; papilledema was present in both eyes. The remainder of the cranial-nerve examination was normal. Tests of motor strength and sensation were normal. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count and differential count and the results of liver- and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Saurabh Rohatgi: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed elevated signal hyperintensity involving the periaqueductal gray matter, dorsal midbrain, dorsal pons, superior and middle cerebellar peduncles, dentate nuclei, and cerebellar white matter (Figure 1B). There was obstructive hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Leptomeningeal enhancement was observed surrounding the brain stem and extending through the inferior aspect of the posterior fossa with entrapment of the fourth ventricle (Figure 1C). There was also leptomeningeal enhancement along multiple upper and lower cranial nerves.
Dr. Clark: Treatment with intravenous acetazolamide and oral dexamethasone was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the neurocritical care unit. On the first hospital day, the patient underwent stereotactically guided endoscopic exploration of the right ventricle. The right foramen of Monro was patent, but there was obstruction in the underlying third ventricle due to adhesions and aberrant anatomical features that precluded endoscopic third ventriculostomy. An external ventricular drain was placed; the opening pressure was 10 cm of water. Analysis of a CSF specimen obtained from the external ventricular drain showed 2 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 90% were neutrophils and 10% were monocytes, and 768 red cells per microliter (reference value, 0); the CSF levels of protein and glucose were normal.
Dexamethasone therapy was discontinued, and treatment with intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone was initiated. Airborne precautions were instituted, and an induced sputum sample was obtained for mycobacterial culture. No acid-fast bacilli were observed on examination of smears of three sputum samples obtained sequentially, and polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of one of the samples for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. CSF cultures were negative, and cytologic examination of the CSF did not show malignant cells.
Dr. Rohatgi: On the third hospital day, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. On the fourth hospital day, MRI of the spine revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, most notably in the lumbar spine, with masslike confluent enhancement filling the subarachnoid space at L5–S2 (Figure 1F).
Dr. Clark: On the fifth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed; the CSF analysis revealed 1120 nucleated cells, of which 77% were neutrophils, and 23 red cells. The CSF protein level was 740 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the glucose level 19 mg per deciliter (1.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). The opening pressure was 10 cm of water relative to the external auditory meatus, which was the same as the pressure that was simultaneously recorded from the clamped external ventricular drain. CSF was sent for culture and cytologic studies.
A diagnostic test result was received.",Chronic Candida albicans meningitis.
"Case 24-2022: A 31-Year-Old Man with Perianal and Penile Ulcers, Rectal Pain, and Rash","Dr. Vivian De Oliveira Rodrigues Gama (Medicine): A 31-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of perianal and penile ulcers, rectal pain, and vesiculopustular rash.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 days before this admission, when he noticed several itchy white “bumps” around the anus that subsequently evolved into ulcerative lesions. The next day, he sought evaluation at a primary care clinic of another hospital. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia were performed. An injection of penicillin G benzathine was administered, and treatment with valacyclovir was started.
During the next 5 days, the perianal ulcers did not abate, and the patient stopped taking valacyclovir. Painful proctitis with rectal bleeding and malodorous, mucopurulent discharge developed, along with fever, chills, drenching sweats, and new tender swelling in the groin. Three days before this admission, a new painless ulcer appeared on the penis that was similar in appearance to the perianal ulcers. Two days before this admission, new scattered vesicular lesions appeared on the arms and legs, and the patient presented to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital for evaluation.
Additional history was obtained from the patient. Fourteen years before this evaluation, sore throat and upper body rash developed; he received a diagnosis of secondary syphilis and was treated with penicillin G benzathine. He also had a history of recurrent oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, for which he was treated intermittently with valacyclovir. He took daily oral emtricitabine and tenofovir for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). There were no known drug allergies.
The patient lived in a suburban area of Massachusetts with two roommates and a cat. Two weeks before this evaluation, he had traveled to an urban area of southeastern Canada. During this trip, he had had sex with male partners without the use of barrier protection. There was no other recent travel. The patient did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he drank alcohol rarely.
On examination, the temperature was 36.5°C, the blood pressure 130/86 mm Hg, the pulse 75 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.9. There were six tender perianal ulcers, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, with raised, firm margins. There was also one ulcer on the dorsum of the penile shaft, measuring 7 mm in diameter, with raised borders (Figure 1). Painful bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy was present. The perianal skin was weeping, and there was proctitis with severe tenderness that precluded digital rectal examination. In addition, there were approximately 12 papulovesicular lesions scattered across the chest, back, arms, and legs. The lesions measured 2 mm in diameter, were filled with clear fluid, and had surrounding erythema (Figure 2A and 2B).
FIGURE 1

Photographs of Perianal and Penile Ulcers from 2 Days before Admission.
FIGURE 2

Photographs of the Rash.
Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. A blood test for treponemal antibodies was positive; a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was reactive at a dilution of 1:1. A blood test for HIV was nonreactive, and tests of urine and rectal specimens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acids were negative. A test of a specimen obtained from a perianal ulcer for HSV nucleic acids was performed, and a blood sample was obtained for bacterial culture. An injection of ceftriaxone was administered, and treatment with valacyclovir and doxycycline was started.
During the next 2 days, the ulcers did not abate and the rectal pain worsened, such that the patient was not able to sit, sleep, or have bowel movements. Additional skin lesions appeared. The patient returned to the infectious disease clinic for evaluation. Anoscopy revealed intense rectal and anal inflammation with shallow ulcerations and purulent exudate, findings consistent with proctitis (Figure 3). The patient was admitted to this hospital.
FIGURE 3

Photograph from Anoscopic Examination.
On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable because of rectal pain. Skin lesions that had become pustular with an erythematous base were scattered across the scalp, chest, back, legs, and arms, including one on the palm (Figure 2C). There were no lesions in the mouth. Multiple tender, enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, measuring more than 1 cm in diameter, were present. The perianal and penile ulcers were tender and had heaped margins around a central dry base. The complete blood count and the white-cell differential count were normal. Swabs from a perianal ulcer and a chest skin lesion were obtained for bacterial culture.
Treatment with intravenous acyclovir was started, and doxycycline was continued; stool softeners and hydromorphone were administered. A blood test for HIV type 1 RNA was performed.
A diagnostic test was performed.","Infection with monkeypox virus, West African clade."
Case 23-2022: A 49-Year-Old Man with Hypoglycemia,"Dr. Mollie Sands (Medicine): A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypoglycemia.
The patient had been well until 3 hours before this admission, when altered mental status developed while he was at work. During a meeting, his colleagues noticed that he was not paying attention or participating in the conversation, which was atypical of the patient. Instead, he was fidgeting and mumbling as though talking to another person. When his mobile telephone rang, he allowed it to continue ringing.
Two hours before this admission, the patient was found by colleagues on the floor of a conference room. His eyes were open, but he was obtunded and making nonpurposeful movements. Emergency medical services were called. On evaluation, a fingerstick glucose measurement was 39 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 109 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Intravenous dextrose was administered, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was obtunded and did not react to sternal rub. Additional intravenous dextrose was administered, and a dextrose infusion was started. The patient’s mental status improved, and he was able to provide additional history. That morning, he had felt that he was in a “dreamlike” state; there were no other symptoms. The altered mental status had resolved, but he could not recall most events of the morning, including the meeting that had taken place 3 hours before admission.
Review of symptoms was notable for unintentional weight gain of one pant size during the past 3 months, as well as intermittent morning dizziness during the past 3 years, which would resolve after the patient ate candy or breakfast. He reported no recent illness, depression, anxiety, change in activity or exercise, or change in intake of food or drink. On a typical day, he had breakfast at 5 a.m., a second breakfast at 10 a.m., lunch at 1 p.m., dinner at 6 p.m., and a snack at 8 p.m. The patient had last eaten approximately 7 hours before presentation to the emergency department.
Two years earlier, the patient had had an episode of drooping and decreased sensation of the left side of the face and difficulty enunciating words, which occurred while he was at work. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital. The blood glucose level was 64 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter), and testing for Lyme disease was negative. He received a diagnosis of Bell’s palsy and was treated with prednisone and acyclovir; the symptoms resolved. Two months later, the patient established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. Routine laboratory testing revealed a blood glucose level of 46 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter).
The patient took vitamin B12 and vitamin D supplements. He took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Sixteen years earlier, he had immigrated to the United States from Southeast Asia and now lived alone in an urban area of New England. He worked as a registered nurse. His father and brother had type 2 diabetes and used insulin.
On examination, the temperature was 35.7°C, the heart rate 82 beats per minute, the blood pressure 146/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.6. The patient appeared well. He had no hepatosplenomegaly or skin hyperpigmentation, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal.
On arrival at the emergency department, the blood glucose level was 36 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter); after the administration of dextrose, a fingerstick glucose measurement was 158 mg per deciliter (8.8 mmol per liter). The complete blood count and blood electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The glycated hemoglobin level was 5.4% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital.

A diagnostic test was performed.",Well-differentiated pancreatic insulin-secreting neuroendocrine tumor (insulinoma).
Case 22-2022: A 34-Year-Old Woman with Cavitary Lung Lesions,"Dr. Theodore R. Pak (Medicine): A 34-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital with hypercortisolism in the context of a metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.
The patient had been well until 4 years before this presentation, when abdominal pain, diarrhea, and ascites developed. A pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with metastases to the liver and spleen was ultimately diagnosed, and treatment with octreotide and everolimus was initiated.
Three years before this presentation, treatment with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy was initiated; four cycles were completed over the course of the next 2 years. Eight months before this presentation, the patient decided to stop taking everolimus because of fatigue.
Seven months before this presentation, the patient was evaluated at another hospital because of weight gain, hyperglycemia, and changes in mood. She was found to have elevated blood levels of corticotropin and elevated salivary and urinary levels of cortisol.
Dr. Adina Haramati: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a pituitary lesion measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. A specimen of blood obtained from the inferior petrosal sinus identified a pituitary source of corticotropin secretion.
Dr. Pak: Treatment with octreotide was discontinued, and 3 months before this presentation, transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary lesion was performed. After the surgery, the cortisol and corticotropin levels remained elevated. Repeat MRI of the head revealed a residual pituitary lesion. Transsphenoidal resection of the residual lesion was performed 2 months before this presentation.
After the second surgery, the cortisol and corticotropin levels decreased but did not normalize. Pathological evaluation of a resected pituitary specimen revealed normal anterior pituitary architecture that was not consistent with a corticotroph adenoma. At a follow-up appointment in the endocrinology clinic after the patient was discharged, the 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was again elevated, and treatment with pasireotide was initiated.
Ten days before this presentation, the patient began to have confusion, urinary incontinence, and recurrent falls. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. Her husband noted atypical impulsive behaviors, such as online shopping and excessive eating.
Dr. Haramati: MRI of the head revealed a small focus of decreased enhancement within the left inferior aspect of the sella turcica, a finding that was consistent with postsurgical changes or residual adenoma.
Dr. Pak: A morning blood level of cortisol was 80 μg per deciliter (2207 nmol per liter; reference range, 4 to 23 μg per deciliter [110 to 635 nmol per liter]), and the blood level of corticotropin was 519 pg per milliliter (114 pmol per liter; reference range, 7.2 to 63 pg per milliliter [1.6 to 14 pmol per liter]). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 9450 μg (26,069 nmol per liter; reference range, 3.5 to 45 μg [10 to 124 nmol per liter]).
Dr. Haramati: MRI of the abdomen revealed an exophytic mass on the pancreatic tail that broadly abutted the left adrenal gland, thickening of both adrenal glands, retroperitoneal metastases on the left side, and extensive hepatic metastases with chronic cavernous transformation of the portal vein.
Dr. Pak: Treatment with pasireotide was discontinued, and treatment with ketoconazole was initiated, in addition to potassium supplementation and spironolactone for hypokalemia. On the tenth day at the other hospital, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment.
On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported fatigue but no fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. She had no cough, hemoptysis, or chest pain; no rheumatologic symptoms; and no history of dysphagia or gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her medical history included asthma and portal-vein thrombosis complicated by ascites, as well as hypothyroidism and central diabetes insipidus after she had undergone transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary lesions. Medications included atovaquone, cholecalciferol, desmopressin, ketoconazole, levothyroxine, metformin, pantoprazole, spironolactone, and potassium chloride. She had no known drug allergies. She did not drink alcohol or use tobacco or vaping products; she smoked marijuana occasionally. She lived with her husband in Vermont and had previously worked in a health care facility. The patient reported that she had had several skin tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis owing to her work in the health care setting, and none had been positive. Before her illness, she had frequently gardened and hiked locally. She had traveled to Canada but otherwise had not traveled outside New England. A paternal aunt had had ovarian cancer.
On examination, the temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 152/87 mm Hg, the pulse 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.0. The patient was alert and oriented and answered questions appropriately. Her face was rounded, and acne and hair thinning were present. The abdomen had increased adiposity and palpable striae. There were several bruises on her arms and legs. A chest radiograph obtained on admission to this hospital showed an implanted venous access device and a patchy opacity in the right upper lung zone.
Treatment with octreotide was reinitiated, and treatment with the other medications that the patient had been receiving was continued. The hypercortisolism was thought to be due to secretion of corticotropin from the metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Bilateral adrenalectomy was planned, but on the second hospital day, the patient became withdrawn and would not speak, take any oral medications, or consume any food. She was transferred to the intensive care unit, and an etomidate infusion was initiated; the dose was adjusted to attain a blood level of cortisol between 10 and 20 μg per deciliter. Subsequent treatment with intravenous lorazepam resulted in marked improvement in the patient’s mental status such that she was following commands and responding appropriately to questions. On the sixth hospital day, bilateral adrenalectomy was performed. Treatment with intravenous hydrocortisone was initiated postoperatively, and on the seventh hospital day, the patient was transferred to the medicine unit of this hospital for further care.
Dr. Haramati: On the eighth hospital day, sinus tachycardia developed. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material according to a pulmonary embolism protocol (Figure 1), revealed a patchy consolidation in the right upper lobe with areas of cavitation and adjacent tree-in-bud opacities, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Although previous imaging was not available for review, clinical notes indicated that positron-emission tomography–CT performed at another hospital 8 months before this presentation had revealed a new cavitary nodule in the right upper lobe that measured 7 mm in diameter.
FIGURE 1

CT of the Chest.
Dr. Pak: A sputum culture showed few squamous epithelial cells, rare polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with no specific type predominating; no acid-fast bacilli were observed on a mycobacterial smear of an induced sputum sample. Urine tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens were negative, as was a blood test for cryptococcal antigen. The blood level of 1,3-β-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60), and the blood galactomannan index was 0.05 (reference range, 0 to 0.49). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

On the ninth hospital day, bronchoscopy was performed; bronchial washings and bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) samples were obtained, and no purulent secretions were observed. Gram’s staining of the BAL fluid revealed few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, and no organisms were seen on an acid-fast bacilli smear or on a modified acid-fast bacilli smear. Examination of the BAL fluid for Pneumocystis jirovecii was negative.
On the 11th hospital day, culture of the BAL fluid showed growth of few methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus organisms. Treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was initiated. On the 12th hospital day, a urine test for histoplasma antigen was positive, at a level of 2.25 ng per milliliter (reference ranges, 0.00 to 0.10 [negative]; 0.11 to 1.10 [indeterminate]; ≥1.11 [positive]).
Management decisions were made, and results of a diagnostic test were received.",Infection with Blastomyces dermatitidis.
Case 21-2022: A 17-Year-Old Girl with Fever and Cough,"Dr. Samantha D. Martin (Pediatrics): A 17-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic because of fever and cough.
The patient had been well until 10 days before admission, when fever and cough that was productive of clear sputum developed. She also had fatigue, eye redness, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and myalgias.
Seven days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the urgent care clinic of another hospital. On examination, there was conjunctival injection in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Treatment with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan was recommended.
During the next 2 days, the fever decreased but did not resolve with the use of acetaminophen. New mild chest discomfort occurred with coughing. An expectorated sputum specimen contained flecks of blood, and the patient returned to the urgent care clinic. The physical examination was unchanged, and rapid antigen testing for influenza types A and B was negative. Additional treatment with ibuprofen, benzonatate, and guaifenesin was recommended.
Three days before this admission, the patient had persistent symptoms and was unable to sleep because of the fever and cough. New shortness of breath developed. She was evaluated by a primary care physician at the other hospital in a telehealth visit. Empirical treatment with amoxicillin was started, and close monitoring was recommended. During the next 3 days, the shortness of breath increased in severity, and the patient was instructed to present to the emergency department of this hospital.
On evaluation, the patient reported cough that was worse with exertion and deep breathing, improved with rest, and was associated with pain in the chest and back on the left side. The sputum had streaks of bright red blood. Other symptoms included fatigue, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, myalgias, and pain in both knees when walking. The eye redness had resolved, but there was mild soreness of the right eye. There was no headache, ear pain, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.
The patient had a history of developmental dysplasia of the hip and was otherwise healthy. She had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccinations. Medications included amoxicillin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, benzonatate, guaifenesin, and dextromethorphan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in New England and lived in a suburban area of New England with her mother, father, and brother. She performed well in high school, which she was attending remotely because of the Covid-19 pandemic; she had no known sick contacts. She had traveled to a Caribbean island 1 year earlier. She was a vegetarian and did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her parents and brother were healthy.
On examination, the temperature was 38.5°C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the blood pressure 142/62 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 35.9. The patient appeared pale, and she coughed and sniffled frequently. She did not use accessory muscles while breathing, and breath sounds in the lower lung fields were decreased. There was no conjunctival injection, lymphadenopathy, joint swelling or tenderness, or rash; the remainder of the physical examination was normal.
The creatinine level was 2.00 mg per deciliter (177 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]) and the C-reactive protein level 77.5 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). The hemoglobin level was 6.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), the hematocrit 21.1% (reference range, 36.0 to 46.0), the white-cell count 11,890 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), and the platelet count 526,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Urinalysis revealed 3+ blood and 2+ protein; microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed more than 100 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2) and 10 to 20 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10), as well as mixed granular casts and red-cell casts. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen for SARS-CoV-2, influenza types A and B, and respiratory syncytial virus was negative. An interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was performed, and blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Randheer Shailam: Chest radiography (Figure 1A and 1B) revealed prominent patchy opacities in the lower lung zones. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1C through 1F), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed peripheral patchy ground-glass opacification with greater involvement of the lower lobes than of the upper lobes, the lingula (left lung), and the middle lobe (right lung). There were also areas of normal-appearing lung. These findings are not specific and can be seen with infectious causes such as bacterial pneumonia and Covid-19, as well as with noninfectious causes such as aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, and less likely, alveolar proteinosis.

Dr. Martin: Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and intravenous fluids were administered. A diagnostic test was performed.",
Case 20-2022: A 25-Year-Old Man with Vision Changes,"Dr. Annabelle Anandappa (Medicine): A 25-year-old man with a history of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of vision changes.
Ten months before this presentation, the patient was evaluated for fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 3.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5) and a white-cell count of 23,450 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000), with 81% lymphocytes and 4% blasts. A bone marrow biopsy was performed.
Dr. Judith A. Ferry: Examination of the bone marrow–biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed markedly hypercellular marrow with a loss of normal elements. There were sheets of blasts, including larger cells with oval-to-irregular nuclei, fine chromatin, distinct nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm, as well as more mature-appearing lymphocyte-like blasts with more condensed chromatin. Cytogenetic analysis revealed an abnormal karyotype: 46,XY,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[15]/46,idem,t(2;12)(p13;p13),?del(10)(p13)[3]/46,idem,del(6)(p21),add(7)(p13)[2]. On next-generation sequencing, SNaPshot analysis identified a RUNX1 mutation, and gene fusion analysis was positive for BCR-ABL1 e13a2. A diagnosis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with BCR-ABL1 was made.
FIGURE 1

Initial Bone Marrow–Biopsy Specimen.
Dr. Anandappa: Induction chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, methotrexate, cytarabine, and prednisone was administered, along with dasatinib and intrathecal cytarabine, methotrexate, and hydrocortisone. One month later, examination of a bone marrow–biopsy specimen revealed 7% blasts. Treatment with blinatumomab was started, and dasatinib was continued.
Seven months before this presentation, examination of a bone marrow–biopsy specimen revealed a complete hematologic response. BCR-ABL1 was undetectable by means of reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction testing.
Five months before this presentation, the patient underwent allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation (HCT) from a matched, unrelated donor after myeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation. Early post-transplantation complications included severe mucositis and febrile neutropenia.
Two months before this presentation, examination of a bone marrow–biopsy specimen revealed a complete hematologic response, no BCR-ABL1 rearrangement, and full donor chimerism. Dasatinib was continued as maintenance therapy. During the next 2 months, the patient had worsening anemia, and dasatinib was stopped.
Two days before this presentation, the patient noticed “large black blobs” that looked like shadows in the periphery of the visual fields of both eyes. There were also intermittent episodes of blurry vision in both eyes that resolved after 10 minutes. Two days later, the patient sought an evaluation in the oncology clinic of this hospital and was transferred to the emergency department for further evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing vision symptoms but no eye pain, flashing lights, or floaters. He also reported 3 weeks of night sweats, areas of swelling in the neck and groin, and a pruritic rash on the upper chest, upper back, and both arms. He had a history of chronic daily migraine headaches, which had frequently been associated with eye pain and photophobia but had not been associated with vision changes. Other medical history included depression and obesity. Medications included tacrolimus, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, famciclovir, omeprazole, and escitalopram, as well as vitamin D and magnesium supplementation. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a coastal town in New England with his mother. He had previously worked in the food-service industry. He had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs; he drank three cans of beer weekly. His family history included breast cancer and headaches in his maternal grandmother, prostate cancer in his paternal grandfather, and hypertension in his father.
On examination, the temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acuity was 20/25 in both eyes with correction, and visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light. There was no proptosis. Slit-lamp examination revealed few cells in the anterior chamber, and funduscopic examination was normal. Test results for cranial nerve function, strength, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait were normal. There was palpable lymphadenopathy in the cervical, clavicular, axillary, and inguinal regions. Discrete papules were present on both arms, and diffuse xerosis and an eczematous rash were present on the upper back and chest.
Laboratory testing revealed a platelet count of 47,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood testing for cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), varicella–zoster virus, and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA was negative. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, and Lyme disease was also negative. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear confirmed the presence of anemia and thrombocytopenia; there were no schistocytes. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Karen Rodriguez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed. T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (Figure 2A and 2B) showed multiple new hyperintense lesions, measuring up to 11 mm in greatest dimension, within the supratentorial and infratentorial regions of the brain. Images obtained after the administration of contrast material showed faint enhancement of the lesions. These foci appeared to be centered within the juxtacortical and periventricular white matter and could reflect areas of demyelination, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) involving the central nervous system (CNS), acute lymphoblastic leukemia with CNS involvement, or an infectious process. There was no abnormal enhancement of the optic nerves or the orbital structures.
FIGURE 2

Imaging Studies Obtained on Admission.
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)–positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) was also performed. The PET-CT scans (Figure 2C through 2H) showed moderate-to-intense FDG uptake associated with widespread lymphadenopathy, including bilateral cervical, axillary, external iliac, and inguinal lymph nodes. There was also abnormal uptake in the spleen.
Dr. Anandappa: The patient was admitted to this hospital, and lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a total protein level of 147 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and a glucose level of 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). The white-cell count was 21 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 61% lymphocytes, 27% neutrophils, and 3% eosinophils; the red-cell count was 16,000 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with xanthochromia present. Gram’s staining of cerebrospinal fluid showed a moderate amount of mononuclear cells and no organisms. Cytologic studies were notable for increased lymphocytes and plasma cells. A diagnostic test was performed.",Plasma-cell myeloma post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder.
Case 19-2022: A 29-Year-Old Woman with Jaundice and Chronic Diarrhea,"Dr. Jon S. DuBois: A 29-year-old woman was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for the management of a soft-tissue mass in the head of the pancreas.
The patient had been well until 7 weeks before this presentation, when progressive pruritus throughout the body developed, along with nausea, bloating, and watery mustard-colored diarrhea. She had eaten sushi for dinner the previous night. She was evaluated in an urgent care clinic in the southeastern United States; she had recently moved there from New England. An injection of methylprednisolone was administered, and hydroxyzine and diphenoxylate–atropine were prescribed. During the next 3 weeks, the symptoms did not abate and jaundice developed, along with new discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, decreased appetite, and amber-colored urine.
Four weeks before this presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a local hospital. The alanine aminotransferase level was 327 U per liter (reference range, 1 to 33), the aspartate aminotransferase level 104 U per liter (reference range, 1 to 32), and the total bilirubin level 5.8 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.1 to 1.2). The carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) level was 73 U per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 35). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed a distended gallbladder with sludge, as well as dilated hepatic and pancreatic ducts. The patient was admitted to the local hospital. On the second hospital day, results of liver-function tests improved, and she was discharged home with plans for an outpatient evaluation with a gastroenterologist.
However, the next day, the patient flew back to New England and presented to the emergency department of a second hospital for further evaluation. On evaluation, she described persistent diffuse pruritus, nausea, right upper abdominal pain, and mustard-colored diarrhea. She also reported fatigue, unintentional weight loss of 3.2 kg during the past month, and poor sleep.
The patient had a history of anxiety and depression. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. Aside from her recent move to the southeastern United States and trip back to New England, there was no recent travel. She worked seasonally as an official at sporting events. She smoked cigarettes occasionally, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs. Her family history included colon cancer in her maternal grandmother, maternal grandfather, and paternal grandmother; breast cancer in her maternal aunt and paternal aunt; and thyroid cancer in her father. In addition, her maternal grandmother had diabetes, and both grandmothers had coronary artery disease.
On examination, the temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 155/82 mm Hg, the pulse 94 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was thin and appeared jaundiced, with scleral icterus. She had diffuse excoriations from scratching. The bowel sounds were normal. There was mild tenderness in the right upper abdomen on palpation, but masses and hepatosplenomegaly were not detected. The remainder of the examination was normal.
The alanine aminotransferase level was 85 U per liter, the aspartate aminotransferase level 267 U per liter, and the total bilirubin level 6.7 mg per deciliter. The CA 19-9 level was 79 U per milliliter. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The abdominal CT images obtained at the first hospital were reviewed, and additional imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Avinash Kambadakone: CT of the abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed diffuse dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts, as well as dilatation of the pancreatic ducts. The dilated ducts terminated abruptly in the pancreatic head. There was a hypodense pancreatic mass at the site of duct obstruction. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (Figure 1C and 1D) also revealed dilatation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, which narrowed abruptly at the level of the pancreatic head, with a heterogeneously enhancing mass at the site of obstruction.
FIGURE 1

Initial Pancreatic Imaging Studies.
Dr. DuBois: The patient was admitted to the second hospital. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a stricture in the bile duct at the level of the mass, and a stent was placed. The bilirubin level initially decreased, but pruritus and diarrhea persisted. By the seventh hospital day, the bilirubin level had increased to 12.6 mg per deciliter and the CA 19-9 level had increased to 959 U per milliliter. Additional diagnostic testing was performed.
Dr. Kambadakone: Endoscopic ultrasonography (Figure 1E) revealed a hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic head. Fine-needle aspiration was performed.
Dr. DuBois: The aspirate showed variably atypical epithelium, but the quantity and quality of the findings were insufficient for definitive diagnosis. Given the uncertain diagnosis and the possibility of cancer, a surgical consultation was obtained. Surgical removal of the mass was recommended to establish the definitive diagnosis, but the patient declined surgery. Prednisone was administered, and the pruritus and diarrhea abated. On the 20th hospital day, the patient was discharged with plans for an outpatient follow-up evaluation with a gastroenterologist.
Three days after discharge from the second hospital, the patient was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. At that time, her symptoms had resolved, the results of liver-function tests were normal, and the CA 19-9 level had decreased to 80 U per milliliter. IgG levels (total and subclasses) were normal, and tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were negative. The possibility of cancer was explained to the patient, and surgical removal of the mass was again recommended, but the patient declined surgery owing to multiple issues related to her work and personal life. A management plan that was acceptable to the patient was adopted during the next 6 months. The patient was closely monitored, and biliary stents were changed when they became occluded. Additional diagnostic procedures were performed, and management decisions were made.",Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
Case 18-2022: A 29-Year-Old Woman with Recurrent Fractures,"Dr. Daryl J. Selen: A 29-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent bone fractures and hypophosphatemia.
The patient had been well until 19 months before admission, when pain in the right midfoot developed during a vacation in Europe. On her return to the United States, she was evaluated by her primary care physician at a clinic affiliated with another hospital; an orthotic device was recommended, but the foot pain did not decrease with use of the device.
Three months later, the pain in the right foot increased in severity after a second vacation in Europe. Radiography of the right foot reportedly revealed no fracture; physical therapy was recommended. During the subsequent 8 months, the pain continued to gradually increase in severity, was worse when the patient stood upright or walked, and was relieved with the administration of ibuprofen.
Eight months before admission, the patient tripped, and the severity of pain in the right foot increased suddenly. She was evaluated in the orthopedic clinic of this hospital. On examination, the height was 173 cm, the weight 115 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 38.6. There was tenderness over the right third metatarsal. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Rene Balza: Radiography of the right foot (Figure 1A) revealed a fracture of the third metatarsal shaft. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right foot revealed a nondisplaced, incompletely healed transverse fracture of the third metatarsal shaft, as well as subchondral sclerosis and bone marrow edema within the distal navicular bone and in the calcaneocuboid joint. Bone stimulation was recommended, but the patient’s pain did not abate after these treatments.
FIGURE 1

Initial Imaging Studies of the Foot and Sacrum.
Dr. Selen: Seven months before admission, the patient had increased pain in the right foot after a fall while walking on ice. Additional imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Balza: Radiography of the right foot (Figure 1B) revealed fractures of the distal fourth and fifth metatarsals.
Dr. Selen: Five months before admission, the second metatarsal region of the right foot was tender on palpation after the patient had walked up a flight of stairs. However, no evidence of a fracture was seen on radiography.
Four months before admission, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. The calcium level was 9.5 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level 26 ng per milliliter (65 nmol per liter; reference range, 20 to 80 ng per deciliter [50 to 200 nmol per liter]), and the parathyroid hormone level 45 pg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 60); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, performed for the assessment of bone mineral density, revealed normal bone mass in the lumbar spine (z score, 0.0; reference range, 1.9 to −1.9) and in the femoral neck (z score, 0.4; reference range, 1.9 to −1.9). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation and weight loss were recommended. The pain in the right foot persisted, and additional imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Balza: Three months before admission, MRI of the right foot (Figure 1C and 1D) showed a nondisplaced fracture of the second metatarsal metadiaphysis with associated bone and soft-tissue edema, a nondisplaced fracture of the medial cuneiform, and healing fractures of the third, fourth, and fifth metatarsals. A controlled ankle motion walking boot and crutches were recommended for ambulation.
Dr. Selen: During the next 3 months, the pain in the right foot persisted, and new pain developed in the left foot. The patient was seen in the pain medicine and podiatry clinics affiliated with the other hospital. Diagnoses of plantar fasciitis, Achilles’ tendinitis, and sinus tarsi syndrome were considered. Treatment with methylprednisolone and celecoxib was initiated, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital.
On evaluation in the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported bilateral foot and ankle pain and swelling that was greater in the right foot and ankle than in the left, as well as stiffness and warmth in the ankles. There was lower back pain and bilateral hip pain, which was greater on the right side than on the left side. The patient reported that the back and hip pain had been present since she was a teenager but had gradually increased in severity during the previous year. Fatigue and generalized weakness had developed and worsened during the previous month. There was no fever, weight loss, or change in diet.
Menarche had occurred when the patient was 11 years of age, and menstrual cycles had been regular since then. There was a history of fractures of the left wrist in childhood. Other medical history included obesity, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, nephrolithiasis, biliary dyskinesia (which had led to cholecystectomy 1 year before this admission), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosed on the basis of a liver biopsy. Medications included celecoxib, ergocalciferol, citalopram, and lorazepam; she had no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England and had previously worked as a nurse; however, she was unable to work during the previous 8 months because of pain and difficulty with ambulation. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had osteopenia; her mother, father, and sister had psoriasis; her father had psoriatic arthritis; and her brother had the Williams syndrome, a rare genetic and developmental disorder.
On examination, the temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 121/78, and the heart rate 94 beats per minute. Dentition was normal, and the gait was antalgic. Proximal muscle strength was intact in both arms (5/5) and slightly reduced in the legs (4/5). There was tenderness over the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints that was more pronounced on the right side than on the left side. The FABER test — in which the leg is flexed and the thigh is abducted and externally rotated — elicited pain in both hips. There was tenderness over the right midfoot and warmth and swelling of the ankles. No musculoskeletal deformities, bowing of the legs, lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, or rashes were noted. The blood level of phosphorus was 1.0 mg per deciliter (0.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter]); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was instructed to go to the emergency department of this hospital. Intravenous sodium phosphate and oral potassium phosphate were administered. Additional imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Balza: Radiography of the lumbar spine, pelvis, hips, and ankles revealed anterolisthesis of L4 and L5 with a defect in the pars interarticularis; there were no fractures. On radiography of the right foot, a fracture in the third metatarsal was initially identified 8 months before admission (Figure 1A), followed by the development of fractures in the fourth and fifth metatarsals 1 month later (Figure 1B). Subsequently, T2-weighted MRI of the sacrum with fat suppression performed on admission (Figure 1E and 1F) revealed vertically oriented hypointense bands in the bilateral sacral alae and a horizontally oriented hypointense band in S2, as well as bone marrow edema adjacent to the fracture lines; the combination of these findings was consistent with an H-shaped sacral insufficiency fracture.
Dr. Selen: The patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.",Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor causing osteomalacia.
Case 17-2022: A 17-Year-Old Boy with Chest Pain,"Dr. Molly Wolf (Medicine and Pediatrics): A 17-year-old boy was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital, before the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, because of chest pain, syncope, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities, and elevated blood levels of creatine kinase and troponin T.
The patient had been well until 5 days before this admission, when fever, nausea, diarrhea, muscle aches, and chest pain developed. The chest pain radiated to the left shoulder and was worse when he took deep breaths or was lying flat. One episode of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis occurred. On the second day of illness, the patient presented to his primary care clinic at another hospital, where a viral illness was diagnosed. An intramuscular glucocorticoid injection was administered, nebulized albuterol was prescribed, and the patient was advised to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen. During the next 3 days, fever and diarrhea resolved, but chest pain, muscle aches, and nausea persisted and were accompanied by decreased appetite and cold, pale fingers.
On the morning of admission, lightheadedness developed. When the patient stood to get a drink of water, he felt unsteady, his vision faded, and syncope occurred. He regained consciousness within 1 minute. Emergency medical services were called, and on arrival they found that the patient was alert and the vital signs were normal. The peripheral blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 24 mg per deciliter (1.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Thiamine and 50 ml of a 50% dextrose solution were administered intravenously, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of the other hospital.
On arrival at the other hospital, the patient reported pleuritic left parasternal chest pain, which he rated at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The temperature was 36.9°C, the pulse 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform was noted to be of low amplitude, and the oxygen saturation was difficult to obtain. The weight was 95.3 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32. The fingers were cool, with a capillary refill time of 3 to 4 seconds. Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and lactic acid were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serum toxicologic screening was negative. Chest radiography revealed a borderline enlarged cardiac silhouette. ECG and echocardiography were performed.

Dr. Oscar J. Benavidez: An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 100 beats per minute (Figure 1). ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were present in leads I and II and the lateral precordial leads. There was no atrial or ventricular ectopy.
FIGURE 1

Electrocardiographic Studies.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular volume and systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63%; there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal. There was no mitral valve prolapse, but mild mitral regurgitation was present. The aortic dimensions were within normal limits, and there was no pericardial effusion. Doppler imaging revealed normal systolic and diastolic velocities.
Dr. Wolf: Three hours after arrival, the patient was transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission, he reported that he had intentionally lost 45 kg of weight during the previous year. He took no medications, herbal remedies, or nutritional supplements and had no known allergies. His immunizations were reportedly current. The patient lived with his mother and younger brother. He played sports; he had no known exposure to sick persons and was not sexually active. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His mother had hypertension, unspecified heart disease, and a history of recurrent miscarriages. A brother had died at 56 days of age from sudden infant death syndrome. His maternal grandmother had hypertension and diabetes, and a maternal aunt had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with nephritis.
On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 37.6°C, the pulse 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The fingers were cold and pale. Examination of the skin revealed striae on the abdomen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Tests for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.031, a pH of 6.0, and 1+ protein. Intravenous fluids, ibuprofen, and famotidine were administered, and supplemental oxygen was discontinued.
During the next 24 hours, the chest pain and ECG abnormalities abated and the blood levels of creatine kinase, troponin T, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase decreased. The patient was discharged home; he was advised to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for pain, and a follow-up appointment with a pediatric cardiologist was scheduled.
Ten days later, in the cardiology clinic, the patient reported that the chest pain had resolved. He appeared well. The pulse was 86 beats per minute and the blood pressure 151/77 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Results of laboratory tests performed in the patient’s primary care clinic 3 days earlier are shown in Table 1. ECG was performed.
Dr. Benavidez: An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 82 beats per minute (Figure 1). There were nonspecific ST-segment changes in leads III and aVF; ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were no longer present.
Dr. Wolf: Ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys was normal. Amlodipine was prescribed, and follow-up appointments with a pediatric nephrologist and a medical geneticist were scheduled but not kept by the patient. Results of laboratory tests performed in the primary care clinic 6 weeks after discharge are shown in Table 1.
Approximately 9.5 months after admission to the pediatric ICU, the patient presented to the emergency department of the other hospital with a 15-hour history of fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, midsternal chest pain, and lightheadedness. He rated the chest pain at 6 out of 10. The temperature was 39.3°C, the pulse 119 beats per minute, the blood pressure 134/61 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. On examination, the capillary refill time in the fingers was 3 to 4 seconds. ECG and imaging studies were performed.
Dr. Benavidez: An ECG showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 126 beats per minute (Figure 1). There were frequent premature atrial and ventricular contractions, along with diffuse flattening of T waves.
Dr. Sjirk J. Westra: Frontal and lateral chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly, as characterized by an increased cardiothoracic ratio, with predominant enlargement of the left atrium (Figure 2). Pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial pulmonary edema and a small left pleural effusion were detected; these findings are suggestive of congestive heart failure.
FIGURE 2

Chest Images Obtained 9.5 Months after First Admission.
Dr. Wolf: The patient was again transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission, he reported that the chest pain had abated. He appeared to be in no distress. The temperature was 38.8°C, the pulse 134 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/49 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg. On auscultation of the heart, the rhythm was irregular; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.027, a pH of 5.0, and 1+ protein. Intravenous fluids, magnesium sulfate, sodium phosphate, amlodipine, famotidine, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen were administered.
During the next 2 days, fever and intermittent chest pain persisted and hypertension developed, with blood-pressure measurements as high as 187/97 mm Hg. Hydralazine and labetalol were administered, and the dose of amlodipine was increased. On examination, strength in the proximal muscles of the arms and legs was graded as 4 out of 5, with 5 indicating normal muscular contraction against full resistance. There were episodes during which the fingers were cold and pale; no nailfold capillary abnormalities were seen. The remainder of the examination was unchanged.
The blood level of troponin T decreased to 0.57 ng per milliliter and the blood level of creatine kinase MB isoenzyme decreased to 50.2 ng per milliliter, whereas the blood level of creatine kinase increased to 8336 U per liter; the urine level of myoglobin was 283 μg per liter (reference value, ≤21). The results of thyroid-function tests were normal. Some peripheral blood glucose measurements, obtained by fingerstick testing, were as low as 22 mg per deciliter (1.2 mmol per liter), despite a regular diet and the administration of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids. These values were not verified by concurrent central venous blood glucose measurements.
Additional test results were received, and a diagnosis was made.",Undifferentiated autoimmune rheumatic disease.
"Case 16-2022: A 55-Year-Old Man with Fevers, Night Sweats, and a Mediastinal Mass","Dr. Jessica L. Logeman (Medicine): A 55-year-old man was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of a mediastinal mass that was identified as part of an evaluation for waxing and waning fevers, night sweats, and fatigue.
The patient had been well until 3 months before admission to this hospital, when fatigue and a transient pruritic maculopapular rash on the forearm developed. During the next 6 weeks, the forearm rash resolved but fatigue persisted. The patient began to take naps during the daytime and was unable to put in full days at his job in construction work. He also began to have night sweats and fevers with temperatures of up to 37.8°C.
Twenty-seven days before admission to this hospital, the patient found that he was unable to work because of fatigue, and he sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Blood tests for anaplasma and babesia nucleic acids were negative, but screening and confirmatory tests for Lyme disease IgM and IgG were positive. A diagnosis of Lyme disease was made, and treatment with doxycycline was initiated. Because gastrointestinal upset developed, doxycycline was discontinued and amoxicillin was prescribed for the remainder of the 14-day course.
Sixteen days before admission to this hospital, the patient began to have chest discomfort, which he described as a sensation of a “softball” in his left lower chest. The chest discomfort limited his ability to breathe, and his primary care physician referred him to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, he reported increasing fatigue and malaise, night sweats, and fevers, along with diffuse arthralgias and myalgias, headache, photophobia with some visual flashes, dyspnea on exertion, edema, a pruritic erythematous rash on his chest, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and distention, and watery diarrhea that occurred three times per day.
On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 145/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 61 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.1. There was a faint diffuse erythematous macular rash on the anterior portion of the chest. The abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and lipase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram was normal. Intravenous normal saline and oral acetaminophen were administered, as was empirical treatment with intravenous piperacillin–tazobactam, hydromorphone, and ondansetron. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.

Dr. Reece J. Goiffon: Fifteen days before admission to this hospital, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a bilobed heterogeneous soft-tissue mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 2.8 cm, in the anterior mediastinum. There were multiple enlarged subcarinal and mediastinal lymph nodes (measuring up to 15 mm in short-axis diameter), multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (measuring up to 11 mm in short-axis diameter), mesenteric fat stranding, and trace ascites.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Logeman: Abdominal discomfort persisted; piperacillin–tazobactam was discontinued and ceftriaxone was prescribed. Two days later, CT of the abdomen, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new pulmonary edema, new small bilateral pleural effusions, and an increased volume of ascites. The patient was transferred to a second hospital for further evaluation.
Physical examination was notable for mild abdominal tenderness and distention, as well as leg edema. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin and a urinalysis were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)–positron-emission tomography (PET) (Figure 1D) revealed indeterminate low-level FDG uptake in the anterior mediastinal soft tissue, as well as in pleural effusions and mediastinal lymph nodes.
During the next week, dyspnea and abdominal pain persisted. Edema increased, specifically in the abdomen, legs, and face; the weight increased to 93.0 kg. Intravenous ceftriaxone and metoclopramide and oral hydromorphone, ondansetron, and lactulose were administered. Additional laboratory tests were performed (Table 2).
TABLE 2

Additional Laboratory Data.
On the eighth day at the second hospital, video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed. The mediastinum reportedly appeared inflamed. The patient underwent an evacuation of pleural fluid and a biopsy of mediastinal soft tissue and lymph nodes primarily in the subcarinal window (level VII). On pathological examination of the biopsy specimens, the mediastinal soft tissue showed fibroconnective and adipose tissue with fibrosis, mild inflammation and fat necrosis, prominent capillary proliferation, and congestion; the lymph nodes were reportedly “mildly abnormal.” Microbiologic evaluation of the biopsy specimens revealed occasional leukocytes but no acid-fast bacilli or fungal elements. On flow cytometry of the biopsy specimens, the mediastinal soft tissue did not show any abnormal cell populations; the lymph nodes contained polyclonal B-cell and heterogeneous T-cell populations, without immunophenotypic evidence of lymphoma. Bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures of the biopsy specimens were negative. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid revealed reactive mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes but no malignant cells.
After the procedure, the creatinine level increased to 2.93 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.50 to 1.30). Examination of urinary sediment revealed hyaline and granular casts. Intravenous furosemide was administered. On the 15th day at the second hospital, the patient was transferred to this hospital.
On arrival, the patient reported persistent fatigue, mild dyspnea, abdominal distention, edema, and anorexia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and the chest rash had resolved. Fevers and night sweats had occurred in a waxing and waning pattern during the previous weeks. He reported intermittent photophobia and headache, without neck stiffness or phonophobia, and had no other neurologic symptoms.
The patient had no history of illness and had not received routine medical care as an adult. He took ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed and had no known allergies to medications. He had been exposed to dust through his job in construction work. He lived with his wife, child, and pet dog and cat in a coastal wooded community in New England. He frequently spent time outdoors, either working or playing golf, and had received multiple tick bites. He had traveled to the Mediterranean and Oceania regions in previous years and, more recently, to the southwestern United States. The patient had never used tobacco or illicit drugs and drank beer rarely. His father had had prostate cancer and colon cancer.
On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 148/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 91.7 kg. Neurologic examination was normal, and there was no nuchal rigidity. There were inspiratory crackles in the left lung. The abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Mild fluctuance was noted on the right side of the chest, at the site of the surgical incision. There was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, submandibular, submental, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There was 2+ pitting edema in the legs.
Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, folate, globulin, haptoglobin, and vitamin B12 were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed cloudy yellow urine with 2+ protein and 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2). An electrocardiogram was normal.
Dr. Goiffon: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1E), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an anterior mediastinal mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 1.9 cm, which was slightly smaller than it had been on the previous chest CT. There were enlarged perivascular, paratracheal, subcarinal, and aortopulmonary mediastinal lymph nodes (measuring up to 12 mm in short-axis diameter) with heterogeneous enhancement. Increased pulmonary edema, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, moderate-volume ascites, mild splenomegaly, and multiple subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes were detected.
Dr. Logeman: On the third hospital day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed no abnormalities. On the fourth day, a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Intravenous furosemide and oral acetaminophen were administered. Lumbar puncture was performed, and 26 ml of colorless fluid was removed; opening pressure was not measured. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. On the fifth day, renal ultrasonography revealed kidneys of normal size with normal parenchyma and no hydronephrosis. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed; results of ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table S1.
Dr. Goiffon: On the 13th day, MRI of the chest was started but could not be completed because the patient had respiratory distress when placed in the prone position. Sequences that were obtained before termination of the study (Figure 1F) showed an anterior mediastinal soft-tissue mass with hypointensity on steady-state gradient echo imaging; the mass was smaller than it had been on chest CT performed before transfer to this hospital. In addition, there were enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, large bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and a hematoma at the site of the surgical incision.
Dr. Logeman: Additional laboratory tests were performed (Table 2). A diagnosis was made.",Idiopathic multicentric Castleman’s disease.
Case 15-2022: A 57-Year-Old Man with Persistent Cough and Pulmonary Opacities,"Dr. George A. Alba: A 57-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of persistent cough and pulmonary opacities.
Six years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa after fevers, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and testicular pain had developed. He was treated with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance therapy with prednisone and weekly methotrexate. He was treated intermittently with escalating doses of prednisone because of episodic worsening of the arthralgias; the most recent such treatment was given 5 months before the current admission. At that time, owing to an exacerbation of pain associated with the arthralgias and at the direction of his physician, he increased the amount of oxycodone he had been taking. He also reported fever and weight loss. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Jeanna M. Harvey Barnes: Five months before the current admission, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Chest CT (Figure 1A and 1B) revealed mild centrilobular emphysema and small pulmonary nodules that appeared unchanged from those seen on imaging that had been performed 6 years earlier. There was also diffuse thickening of the bronchial wall, layering secretions in the trachea and right main-stem bronchus, a mildly patulous esophagus, and a small hiatal hernia. There were no clinically significant findings on imaging of the abdomen or pelvis.
FIGURE 1

Initial Imaging Studies of the Chest.
Dr. Alba: A test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal, as was the IgG level.
Three months before the current admission, the patient had fevers and a cough productive of green sputum. The temperature was 37.3°C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air. Thrush was present in the oropharynx. Auscultation of the chest revealed crackles and wheezing in the right lung. Blood levels of electrolytes, lipase, amylase, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 1C) showed patchy and confluent opacities predominantly in the right mid and lower lung.
Dr. Alba: The patient was admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin was administered. A blood test for cryptococcal antigen and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and Candida albicans; a test for Pneumocystis jirovecii was negative. During the next several days, fever resolved and the oxygen saturation and white-cell count normalized. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home to complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin. After he completed the course of levofloxacin, his cough and constitutional symptoms abated partially but did not return to baseline. His primary care physician prescribed inhaled fluticasone–salmeterol and as-needed inhaled albuterol.
Six weeks after the patient was discharged from this hospital (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission), his wife began to have a nonproductive cough and rhinorrhea; several days later, the patient had similar symptoms, along with increased production of brown sputum. He sought medical attention after awakening with coughing and dyspnea. The temperature was 38.4°C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air.
Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 1D) obtained 1 month before the current admission showed patchy opacities in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes.
Dr. Alba: Electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin; oral prednisone; and inhaled albuterol and ipratropium was administered. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. After two days, the patient was discharged home to complete a 7-day course of levofloxacin.
Over the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient had malaise, productive cough, fever, and sweats. He stopped smoking cigarettes.
Eight days before the current admission, the patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.2°C and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. There were crackles in both lung bases and in the right middle lung field, with no wheezes. Blood levels of electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2A) showed multifocal reticulonodular and patchy opacities, which were confluent in the right lower lobe. CT of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal clustered, centrilobular nodules and opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern with scattered areas of focal consolidation that were present predominantly in the right middle and lower lobes. There was associated mild mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy that had not been present on the previous chest CT examination.
FIGURE 2

Subsequent Imaging Studies of the Chest.
Dr. Alba: The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and additional testing was performed. Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies were negative, and blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal. A urine test for legionella antigen was negative.
On the third hospital day, a bronchoscopy and a transbronchial biopsy were performed. The bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from the right middle lobe was cloudy; analysis of the fluid revealed 888 nucleated cells per microliter (of which 48% were neutrophils and 2% were lymphocytes, with no eosinophils). Gram’s staining of the BAL fluid revealed neutrophils and sparse growth of gram-positive cocci. Staining for acid-fast organisms was negative; culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. Tests of the BAL fluid for influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, P. jirovecii, histoplasma antigen, and blastomyces antigen were negative, as were cultures for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. An interferon-γ release assay for M. tuberculosis was also negative. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day, with follow-up scheduled in the pulmonary clinic for 3 weeks later.
Four days after the patient was discharged, a BAL test for galactomannan returned a positive result (antigen index, ≥3.750; negative test, <0.5), and the patient was readmitted to this hospital. He reported ongoing dyspnea, cough with thick white sputum, and persistent fever with a temperature of up to 39.3°C. A review of systems was notable for diffuse chronic arthralgias, a bitter taste in the mouth, and intermittent dysphagia. There was no chest pain, edema, orthopnea, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, or rash, and he had no known current sick contacts. The weight was 5 kg lower than that recorded 1 year earlier.
Medical history was notable for polyarteritis nodosa, deep venous thrombosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pancreatitis in the context of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, osteopenia, and chronic neuropathic pain. Medications included aspirin, prednisone, methotrexate, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, folate supplementation, metformin, atenolol, simvastatin, pregabalin, and as-needed oxycodone, as well as inhaled fluticasone–salmeterol and albuterol as needed. Lisinopril had reportedly caused pancreatic inflammation; there were no other known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was of White European ancestry. He lived in New England with his wife and was retired from an office position. Three decades earlier, he had worked in a machine shop where solvents, fuels, and sulfur compounds were used but had had no known exposure to these agents. There was no history of exposure to mold, pets, or asbestos. He had received influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. He and his wife had traveled within the United States and to the Caribbean. He had smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit in the weeks before the current admission. He had previously smoked marijuana, rarely consumed alcohol, and never used other substances. There was no family history of autoimmune or pulmonary disease; his father had died from colorectal cancer, and his mother had had esophageal cancer and had died after a stroke. His three adult children were healthy.
The temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/69 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. He had a slightly cushingoid appearance and was tachypneic, although he was able to speak in full sentences. Auscultation of the chest revealed rales at the right lung base, rhonchi during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases that were more pronounced in the right lung than in the left lung, and intermittent inspiratory wheezing in the right lung. The rest of the examination was normal.
Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2D) showed progression of the diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities, with additional patchy opacities in the right lung and left lower lobe, as compared with the image obtained 1 week earlier.
Dr. Alba: Blood levels of electrolytes, amylase, lipase, N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney and liver function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal, and a urine test for legionella antigen was negative.
The BAL-fluid culture obtained during the previous admission grew enterococcus species, C. albicans, and C. glabrata; no mycobacteria grew in any of three induced sputum samples obtained during the previous admission. Empirical treatment with intravenous voriconazole was initiated, and ongoing treatment with methotrexate was interrupted.
Cytologic analysis of the BAL fluid and the transbronchial-biopsy specimen obtained during the previous admission revealed evidence of acute inflammation, bronchial columnar cells, and pulmonary macrophages. There were no malignant cells. Evaluation of the bronchial mucosa revealed no abnormalities.
On the second hospital day, the temperature was 37.9°C and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute.
Dr. Harvey Barnes: Repeat CT of the chest (Figure 2E and 2F) was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary embolism protocol. This imaging study revealed extensive centrilobular pulmonary nodules, opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern, and patchy ground-glass opacities. There was bronchial wall thickening with mucus plugging, predominantly affecting the lower lobes. There were additional areas of nodular consolidation that were more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung. These findings indicated a progression of disease as compared with the chest CT performed 1 week before the current admission. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Dr. Alba: Additional induced sputum samples were obtained for culture; Gram’s staining revealed abundant neutrophils and abundant mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.
On the third hospital day, the temperature was 36.9°C and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute.
Diagnostic tests were performed.",Aspiration pneumonia.
Case 14-2022: A 57-Year-Old Man with Chylous Ascites,"Dr. Amiko M. Uchida (Medicine): A 57-year-old man was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of new ascites.
Twenty years before the current presentation, the patient began to have swelling of the legs, which initially occurred only after airplane trips. During the fifth decade of life, the leg swelling was present on a daily basis. Thirteen years before the current presentation, the patient began to have frequent bowel movements (up to four per day) with loose malodorous stools and increased flatus. He was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. On examination, the abdomen was soft and nontender, with no evidence of organomegaly. There was pitting edema in both legs. The blood level of total protein was 5.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 6.0 to 8.3), and the blood albumin level was 3.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.3 to 5.0). Results of other liver-function tests, including liver enzyme levels, were normal. The protein level in a 24-hour urine sample was normal. The blood alpha1-antitrypsin level was 173 mg per deciliter (reference value, <54). Blood levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM were low. Serologic tests for anti–tissue transglutaminase antibodies and anti-giardia antibodies were negative.
Dr. Mark A. Anderson: Computed tomographic (CT) enterography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed diffuse mural thickening and hyperenhancement of the small bowel, with no evidence of stricturing or obstruction (Figure 1A and 1B). In addition, there was trace ascites (Figure 1B).
FIGURE 1

Initial Imaging Studies.
Dr. Uchida: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy revealed no visible abnormalities. A random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed a focal area with more than 70 eosinophils per high-power field; a biopsy specimen of the gastric antrum showed scattered eosinophils in the lamina propria. A working diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy was made, although neither a 2-week course of oral prednisone nor a 6-week course of oral budesonide led to a decrease in the number of bowel movements or leg edema. No further treatment was pursued.
Eleven years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. There had been no weight loss or recurrent infections, but leg edema persisted. Repeat EGD revealed no visible abnormalities, and a random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed fewer eosinophils than the previous specimen, with no epithelial damage. CT enterography revealed diffuse wall thickening of the entire small bowel and trace ascites. Treatment for protein-losing enteropathy — which included limiting salt intake, increasing dietary protein, and wearing compression stockings — was recommended. During the next 10 years, the leg edema was stable and was occasionally treated with diuretic agents, which did not lead to substantial improvement.
Six months before the current presentation, the patient began to have dyspnea on exertion. Three months before this presentation, abdominal distention developed. The patient initially attributed the dyspnea and abdominal distention to weight gain due to reduced physical activity during quarantine for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Six weeks before this presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician in a video conference. On the basis of this evaluation, laboratory and imaging studies were obtained. The blood level of total protein was 4.5 g per deciliter (updated reference range, 6.4 to 8.3), and the blood albumin level was 2.1 g per deciliter. The complete blood count, blood levels of electrolytes and glucose, and results of liver-function and kidney-function tests were normal.
Dr. Anderson: CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules, enlarged subcarinal and upper mesenteric lymph nodes, and moderate-volume ascites in the upper abdomen.
Dr. Uchida: Three weeks later, paracentesis was performed, and 3.1 liters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. Cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.

On the current presentation, the patient reported that he was having bowel movements with normally formed stools and no abdominal pain. His wife had noticed that he appeared to be moving slowly when performing activities of daily living and that he had lost muscle mass in his arms. There was no history of abdominal surgery or trauma to the abdomen. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, osteoarthritis, and hypogammaglobulinemia. There was no history of recurrent infections, asthma, or atopic dermatitis. Medications included aspirin, insulin glargine, and metformin. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his wife in a suburb of Boston and worked in an office. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother had colon cancer.
The physical examination was limited, because the evaluation was done in a video conference in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Anderson: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed multiple new hypoenhancing lesions throughout the right and left hepatic lobes, diffuse small-bowel wall thickening, moderate-volume ascites, upper abdominal varices, and enlarged upper abdominal and pelvic nodes (Figure 1C, 1D, and 1E). The only liver lesions that were large enough for reliable percutaneous sampling were at the far cranial aspect of the hepatic dome, where respiratory motion and crossing the diaphragm would have made an attempt at CT-guided or ultrasonographically guided biopsy very challenging, if not prohibitive. CT of the chest revealed tree-in-bud and clustered nodules, predominantly in the dependent lower lobes, and right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy (Figure 1F).
Dr. Uchida: Tests for hepatitis C virus antibodies and for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, surface antigen, and core antibodies were negative. Repeat paracentesis was performed, and 3.2 liters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. An acid-fast stain of a concentrated specimen of ascitic fluid was negative. Cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. A fluoroscopically guided transjugular liver biopsy was also performed. The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was 2 mm Hg (normal value, <5); the right atrial pressure was 7 mm Hg, the wedged hepatic venous pressure 11 mm Hg, and the free hepatic venous pressure 9 mm Hg.
Dr. Megan J. Fitzpatrick: Histologic examination of the liver-biopsy specimen revealed mild mixed portal inflammation and grade 1 steatosis without steatohepatitis. A trichrome stain showed mild portal tract edema but no fibrosis.
Dr. Uchida: Mycobacterial cultures of the ascitic fluid were negative. A diagnostic test was performed.","High-grade B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified."
"Case 13-2022: A 56-Year-Old Man with Myalgias, Fever, and Bradycardia","Dr. Shaan Khurshid: A 56-year-old man presented to this hospital in early autumn with a 1-month history of myalgias and fever.
Approximately 4 weeks before the current presentation, the patient began to have generalized myalgias and arthralgias, which were worst in the shoulders, proximal arms, and upper back. He had fever with temperatures of up to 38.2°C, along with chills and diaphoresis. He took naproxen, and the next day, he presented to an urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The temperature was 37.2°C, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 175/95 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Symptoms abated after 3 days, but then fever with temperatures of up to 38.3°C and fatigue occurred. The patient stopped consuming alcohol.
Three weeks later, the patient had episodes of mild dyspnea with “coughing fits” and presented to a second urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The temperature was 37.2°C, the heart rate 59 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/75 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued, but the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Another test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, and the results of urinalysis and chest radiography were normal.
The next day, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician at another hospital. He reported a 1-month history of “stabbing” back pain between his shoulders, which was worst at the end of the day and was not relieved with the use of naproxen or a heating pad. The temperature was 36.7°C, the heart rate 48 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There was tenderness on palpation of the left thoracic paraspinal area, but the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Radiographic images of the thoracic spine were reportedly normal. Laboratory test results obtained at that time are shown in Table 1, alongside routine test results obtained 6 months earlier. The patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital.

On the systems review, the patient reported that he had recently measured heart rates of 40 to 50 beats per minute on his home pulse oximeter; his baseline heart rate was 80 to 90 beats per minute. He also reported a history of dysuria that was attributed to chronic prostatitis, as well as pain in the left wrist and knee that was attributed to gout. He reported no weight loss, sweats, palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest discomfort, joint swelling or redness, rash, headache, focal neurologic symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding.
The patient’s medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, hypertension with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, palpitations, unprovoked pulmonary embolism, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperuricemia, latent tuberculosis, malaria, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, Helicobacter pylori infection, colonic schistosomiasis, prostatism, and thrombocytopenia. His last dental procedure had taken place more than 2 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, metoprolol, and losartan, as well as sildenafil as needed. He had received two vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), with the second vaccine administered 7 months before the current evaluation. There were no known adverse reactions to medication.
The patient grew up in equatorial Central Africa. He had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier and had not returned to Africa for more than 5 years. He was employed at a local university and occasionally had contact with college students. He lived with his family in a suburb of Boston. During the summer months, he had visited islands in Massachusetts and coastal wooded areas to hike, camp, and swim. The patient reported that he had encountered many ticks but had not received a tick bite. He had been scratched by cats; there were no other animal exposures. In the past, he had consumed two or three beers daily, but he had stopped all alcohol intake during the previous month. He had never used tobacco or illicit substances. His family history was notable for atherosclerotic coronary disease.
On examination, the temperature was 36.5°C, the heart rate 46 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.4. He appeared comfortable. Auscultation of the chest revealed a bradycardic heart rate. There was tenderness on palpation of the left infrascapular area. A prostate examination revealed a nontender hemorrhoid. There was no rash or lymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal.
Blood levels of calcium, total protein, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Electrocardiograms were notable for sinus rhythm with first-degree and second-degree (2:1) atrioventricular block with intermittent right bundle-branch block (Figure 1A), alternating with sinus rhythm with third-degree (complete) atrioventricular block and junctional escape rhythm with intraventricular conduction delay (Figure 1B). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was negative for pulmonary embolism.
FIGURE 1

Initial Cardiac Imaging Studies.
Intravenous ceftriaxone, naproxen, acetaminophen, and oxycodone were administered. The patient was evaluated by an electrophysiologist and admitted to the cardiology unit of this hospital. The next day, the heart rate remained at approximately 40 beats per minute, and the maximum temperature was 37.8°C. Oxycodone and topical lidocaine were administered.
Dr. Alex L. Huang: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal biventricular systolic function, with no regional left ventricular wall-motion abnormalities. There was mild diastolic mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (Figure 1C), a finding consistent with atrioventricular block.1 There was no evidence of valvular vegetations.
Dr. Khurshid: The blood level of high-sensitivity troponin was 63 ng per liter. Urinalysis was negative, as were blood tests for Lyme disease antibodies, anti-rickettsia IgM, ehrlichia and anaplasma DNA, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, and babesia.
On the third hospital day, tests for SARS-CoV-2, Bartonella henselae and B. quintana antibodies, and anti-treponemal antibodies were negative. An interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive.
Dr. Borek Foldyna: The patient underwent cardiac CT with electrocardiographic gating, including contrast-enhanced CT angiography and delayed imaging. Epicardial fat and a thickened interatrial septum abutting the noncoronary sinus of the aortic valve showed increased radiodensity on delayed imaging (Figure 2A and 2B); these findings are suggestive of inflammatory changes and may indicate evolving abscess. The tricuspid aortic valve had mildly thickened leaflets, but there was no evidence of focal valvular vegetations, thrombi, or calcifications.
FIGURE 2

Advanced Cardiac Imaging Studies.
Dr. Khurshid: Oral doxycycline was administered. On the fourth hospital day, the ventricular rate measured between 30 and 40 beats per minute, and the maximum temperature was 37.9°C.",Regional myocarditis due to infection with Listeria monocytogenes.
Case 12-2022: A 41-Year-Old Woman with Transient Ischemic Attack and Mitral Valve Masses,"Dr. Jacquelyn M. Nestor (Medicine): A 41-year-old woman with transient dysarthria and facial droop was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of masses on the mitral valve.
Three weeks before this presentation, the patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital because of concerns about heavy vaginal bleeding that had developed 1 week earlier and was associated with crampy abdominal pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and lightheadedness. Examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/79 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 100% while she was breathing ambient air; the examination was otherwise reportedly normal, although a gynecologic examination was not performed. Laboratory results were notable for a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0; previous level 1 year earlier, 9.1), a mean corpuscular volume of 71.3 fl (reference range, 80 to 94), and a platelet count of 148,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Normal saline was administered intravenously, and a 5-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed.
Eleven days after the patient completed the therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate (9 days before this presentation), heavy vaginal bleeding and dyspnea recurred. An additional 3-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed. The evening after the patient finished the second course of treatment, within 1 hour after she had been seen and had appeared to be well, her husband noted that she had facial droop on the right side and slurred speech; he called emergency medical services. When she arrived at the emergency department of a second hospital, within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms, her examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 173/83 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 99% while she was breathing ambient air. She was noted to have facial droop on the right side and unintelligible speech.
Dr. Sandra P. Rincon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Figure 1A) revealed no evidence of acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage. Small chronic infarcts were seen in the right thalamus and right cerebellar hemisphere. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck did not show high-grade stenosis or large-vessel occlusion.
FIGURE 1

Neuroimaging Studies.
Dr. Nestor: A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. Blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the white-cell count and differential count and the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable, and urinalysis showed 3+ blood, no protein, and no casts. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Within 45 minutes after the patient arrived at the emergency department of the second hospital, the facial asymmetry and dysarthria resolved. The patient was admitted to the medical unit of the second hospital.

Dr. Rincon: The next day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography of the head and neck again revealed old lacunar infarcts in the right thalamus (Figure 1B) and right cerebellar hemisphere (Figure 1C). There was no evidence of an acute infarction (Figure 1D), intracranial hemorrhage, or cerebrovascular occlusion (Figure 1E and 1F).
Dr. Nestor: Two units of packed red cells were transfused. Post-transfusion laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 2A and 2B and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) showed thickened mitral valve leaflets and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg.
FIGURE 2

Echocardiograms and CT Scans of the Abdomen and Pelvis.
Dr. Evin Yucel: On the third hospital day, a transesophageal echocardiogram (Figure 2C and Videos 2 and 3) showed multiple echodensities on the atrial side of the mitral valve leaflets at the closure lines that were consistent with vegetations. Cultures of blood were obtained, and heparin was administered intravenously.
Dr. Nestor: On the fourth hospital day, the rate of heparin infusion was decreased at 6-hour intervals when the partial-thromboplastin time exceeded 150 seconds, until the infusion was stopped. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1; complement levels (C3 and C4) were normal. Additional cultures of blood were obtained.
Dr. Rincon: Repeat CT of the head revealed no acute abnormality. CT of the chest showed clustered nodules in the lower lobes that were probably related to aspiration, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2D, 2E, and 2F) revealed an enlarged heterogeneous uterus with multiple fibroids.
Dr. Nestor: The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On a review of systems, she reported no recurrence of dysarthria or facial droop and noted no other neurologic symptoms. She reported that she had had heavy menstrual bleeding and exertional dyspnea in the weeks preceding this presentation; pruritic, macular rashes on the trunk, scalp, arms, and legs with associated photosensitivity that had persisted for many weeks; new Raynaud’s phenomenon in the past 10 months; and a long history of dry eyes and seasonal allergies. Medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, vitamin B12 deficiency, iron deficiency resulting in past iron infusions, uterine fibroids, anxiety, and hypertension. Surgical history included multiple laparoscopies and two laparotomies, including salpingo-oophorectomy for endometriosis. Owing to infertility, she had undergone in vitro fertilization; she had a first-trimester spontaneous abortion at 25 years of age. During her second pregnancy at 33 years of age, a screening rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was positive at 1:8; however, a treponemal-specific confirmatory test for syphilis was negative. Pregnancy-induced hypertension developed, followed by placental abruption at 30 weeks, which resulted in a cesarean delivery. Medications included amlodipine, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, and medroxyprogesterone acetate. She had no known medication allergies.
The patient lived in eastern Massachusetts with her husband and child. She did not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. Her mother had rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and a history of spontaneous abortion. One grandmother had diabetes and the other grandmother had had a stroke. An aunt had had leukemia and later breast cancer. Her child has psoriasis.
The temperature was 36.8°C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 155/98 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 175 cm, the weight 107 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 34.9. There were several small, circular macules on her back (Figure 3). There was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex. She had no lymphadenopathy, petechiae, nail changes, or evidence of arthritis. The remainder of the examination was normal, as was a neurologic examination.
FIGURE 3

Clinical Photograph of Macules on the Back.
Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. All the blood cultures obtained at the second hospital showed no growth. An electrocardiogram was normal.
Diagnostic test results were received, and management decisions were made.",Systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospholipid syndrome.
Case 11-2022: An 80-Year-Old Woman with Pancytopenia,"Dr. Leontios Pappas (Medicine): An 80-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of pancytopenia and the identification of schistocytes on a peripheral-blood smear.
Six weeks before admission to this hospital, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, along with chills and subjective fever. The symptoms resolved after 4 days without specific intervention, but then intermittent dysphagia with solid foods and early satiety developed. During the next 4 weeks, the patient had gradually progressive fatigue and light-headedness. The fatigue progressed to the point that she could no longer stay at work for more than a few hours; she presented to another hospital for evaluation.
At the other hospital, the patient reported that she had ongoing fatigue and had lost 6 kg of weight over a 5-week period. On examination, the temperature was 38.9°C, the weight 55.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.9. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia, and examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed a small hiatal hernia, multiple simple cysts in the right kidney, and indeterminate bilateral pelvic masses measuring 4.8 cm in diameter on the right side and 6.3 cm in diameter on the left side (Figure 1).
FIGURE 1

CT of the Abdomen and Pelvis.
Dr. Pappas: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level decreased to 6.6 g per deciliter, and two units of packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed diffuse esophageal inflammation with white exudates throughout the esophagus; examination of brushings revealed yeast consistent with candida, and treatment with fluconazole was initiated.
During the next 3 hospital days, the patient continued to feel unwell, with persistent fever and limited oral intake due to odynophagia, and the administration of intravenous fluids was continued. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. On hospital day 5, empirical therapy with doxycycline was started because of concerns about a possible tickborne illness.
On hospital day 6, the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 94% when oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening, findings consistent with pulmonary edema, along with bilateral pleural effusions of a small to moderate size. The administration of intravenous fluids was stopped, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was provided.
On hospital day 7, fever resolved but pancytopenia persisted. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a moderate amount of schistocytes, severe anisocytosis, large platelets, and an increased amount of bands without blasts. Direct and indirect Coombs’ tests were negative, as were nucleic acid tests for babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, cobalamin, folate, homocysteine, and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The results of serologic tests for Epstein–Barr virus were consistent with previous infection. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed phenotypically normal myeloid cells; there was an increased amount of atypical CD34+ myeloblasts, which accounted for less than 1% of leukocytes and were of unclear clinical significance.
A tunneled catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and plasma exchange was initiated for the treatment of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Total parenteral nutrition was also initiated, because oral intake was still limited by odynophagia.
On hospital day 8, oral intake of soft foods and liquids increased. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, as well as a mildly thickened aortic valve with no stenosis or regurgitation; there was trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. On hospital day 9, the patient underwent additional plasma exchange and was transferred to this hospital for further care.
On evaluation in this hospital, the patient reported that her energy level had increased. She recalled that she had felt mildly confused at the other hospital, but the confusion had since resolved. She had had no gum bleeding or blood in the stool or urine. Other medical history included hypertension and dyslipidemia. Surgical history included hysterectomy at 40 years of age, with no vaginal bleeding since the procedure.
One year earlier, routine laboratory testing had revealed mild thrombocytopenia and anemia. A bone marrow biopsy performed at that time had revealed slightly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis but with some erythroid abnormalities and occasional hyperchromatic megakaryocytes; cytogenetic analysis had shown a loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and a gain of chromosome 8 in 65% of the cells. Thereafter, blood counts monitored every 4 months, including 4 months before this presentation, had remained stable; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Medications included amlodipine, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. She had smoked tobacco for 50 years but had quit 5 years before this presentation. She was widowed and lived alone in New England; her work involved cleaning a church several days a week. Her sister had had breast cancer at 30 years of age, and a brother had had testicular cancer at a young age and liver cancer at 55 years of age.
On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 150/65 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented, and she did not appear ill. There were no petechiae. There was no bleeding at the site of tunneled catheter placement in the right internal jugular vein. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard at the left lower sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.
Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes, anisocytosis, and a low platelet count, with large platelets present; the white cells appeared normal, and there were no blasts (Figure 2). The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. The levels of serum free kappa and lambda light chains were increased, with a normal ratio. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. Urinalysis showed 2+ urobilinogen, without bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, protein, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Consultation was obtained from the gynecology service regarding the bilateral pelvic masses noted on CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Blood levels of CA 125, CA 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal, and follow-up in the gynecology clinic was recommended for further evaluation after discharge. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Case 10-2022: A 78-Year-Old Man with Marked Ventricular Wall Thickening,"Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 78-year-old man was evaluated in the cardiology clinic of this hospital because of biventricular myocardial wall thickening, progressive mitral regurgitation, and ventricular arrhythmias.
The patient had been a distinguished multisport athlete in high school and college. However, in his 20s, he found that he was unable to perform competitively, and he noticed that he did not sweat as much as his teammates. After an episode of sports-related exertional dizziness, he was evaluated by a physician, and a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was considered.
Twenty-five years before the current evaluation, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 19 mm (reference value, ≤11), a left ventricular ejection fraction of 74% (reference range, 50 to 75), mitral valve thickening, and trace mitral regurgitation, with no left ventricular outflow gradient. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle-branch block, precordial J-point elevation, and QRS voltage that met the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure 1A). The patient’s blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, and he started treatment with metoprolol succinate and then also with amlodipine for elevated blood pressure.
FIGURE 1

Electrocardiograms.
During the next 10 years, the patient had intermittent chest discomfort, exertional dyspnea, and leg edema. The chest discomfort and exertional dyspnea were most likely to occur when he was walking or after he had eaten a meal. He was evaluated by three cardiologists; treatment with metoprolol succinate and amlodipine was continued, treatment with enalapril was started, and triamterene–hydrochlorothiazide was administered as needed for leg edema.
A repeat TTE reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 20 mm, a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular wall thickening, left atrial enlargement, mitral valve thickening, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, aortic valve thickening, and mild ascending aortic dilatation (39 mm), with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. An exercise stress test followed by imaging performed with the use of sestamibi (known as a sestamibi stress test) revealed left ventricular wall thickening, with no perfusion defects. Coronary angiography revealed evidence of chronic total occlusion of the distal left anterior descending artery, with collateral flow from both the left and right coronary arteries. Left ventriculography revealed hyperdynamic left ventricular function and 2+ mitral regurgitation (see Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 28 mm Hg (reference range, 5 to 10), with no left ventricular intracavitary gradient, including during ventricular ectopic beats and during the Valsalva maneuver, and with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The blood pressure remained well controlled while the patient was taking metoprolol, amlodipine, and enalapril.
Nine years before the current evaluation, the patient had complete heart block with symptomatic bradycardia (Figure 1B), with associated nausea, dizziness, and chest discomfort. A temporary transvenous pacing wire was placed; the results of coronary angiography performed at that time were unchanged from the previous study. The creatinine level was 1.2 mg per deciliter (106 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]); the blood levels of electrolytes and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis. A dual-chamber implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) was placed. Four months later, atrial fibrillation developed. Cardioversion was performed with guidance by transesophageal echocardiography, resulting in sinus rhythm. However, atrial fibrillation recurred after 3 days. Treatment with amiodarone and warfarin was begun.
During the next 5 years, recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. A repeat TTE showed a left ventricular wall thickness of 23 mm and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.
Four years before the current evaluation, during a holiday trip, the patient was hospitalized in another state because of pulmonary edema that developed after he had consumed food that was high in sodium. He was treated with intravenous furosemide and discharged with a prescription for oral furosemide. Findings on TTE were reportedly similar to those observed previously. Treatment with amlodipine was stopped because of lightheadedness.
At follow-up appointments during the next 4 years, the patient reported fatigue and exertional dyspnea that occurred after he had climbed one flight of stairs or when he was walking on an incline. In addition, he had nocturia once per night, slept on two pillows, and had intermittent wheezing, including episodes that awakened him from sleep. Treatment with oral furosemide (administered twice daily) was continued. Recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. Approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation, the patient sustained a fall that was unrelated to his cardiac condition. At that time, computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of hemorrhage or stroke but showed periventricular and deep white-matter hypodensities. Results of pulmonary-function testing were normal.
The patient presented for the current evaluation at the request of his two teenage grandsons, who wanted to know about any familial cardiac risk factors that could influence their participation in sports. A review of systems was notable for intermittent palpitations, chronic dry eyes, reduced hearing, tinnitus in both ears (greater in the right ear than in the left ear), restless legs, and constipation. The patient reported no headache, paresthesia, stroke symptoms, diarrhea, skin changes, or intolerance to heat or cold. His medical history included cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, atrioventricular block and atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, cataracts, and prostatic hypertrophy with carcinoma in situ. Medications included furosemide, warfarin, amiodarone, aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, enalapril, and tamsulosin, as well as inhaled fluticasone. Amiodarone had caused thyroiditis, which had been treated with a course of prednisone; there were no other known adverse reactions to medication.
The patient was a retired executive and lived with his spouse in Massachusetts. His family history was notable for brain cancer in his father, obstructive lung disease and lung cancer in his mother, and lung cancer in his sister, who had died from the disease. There was also a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in his sister and in a niece. His family was of Mediterranean origin; information about other relatives was limited. His son and grandsons were healthy, and his son had reportedly had normal results on an electrocardiogram and echocardiograms. The patient did not drink alcohol and had never used tobacco.
On examination, the heart rate was 79 beats per minute and the blood pressure 106/60 mm Hg. The weight was 89 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 26.6. There was a left ventricular heave. Auscultation revealed splitting of the S2 heart sound, a grade 3/6 systolic murmur that could be heard throughout the precordium and did not change during the Valsalva maneuver, and a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiated to the axilla; there was no S3 heart sound. There was trace leg edema and mild chronic venous stasis. The rest of the examination was normal.
Laboratory test results were notable for a creatinine level of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 μmol per liter), a urea nitrogen level of 39 mg per deciliter (13.9 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), an international normalized ratio of 2.1 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), and an N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2523 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 1800), as well as 1+ protein on urinalysis. The blood levels of iron, glycated hemoglobin, thyrotropin, and free thyroxine were normal, and a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing.
A TTE was obtained, and additional diagnostic tests were performed.",Fabry’s disease.
"Case 9-2022: A 56-Year-Old Woman with Fever, Myalgias, Diarrhea, and Cough","Dr. Alison C. Castle: A 56-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in the spring of 2020, during the initial surge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic in Boston, because of fever, myalgias, diarrhea, and a dry cough.
Six weeks before this admission, the patient had contact with a person with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. At that time, she did not have any symptoms compatible with Covid-19 and was not tested for SARS-CoV-2.
Four weeks before this admission, in accordance with statewide recommendations from the Department of Public Health, the patient began isolating at home with her teenage son, working from home, and having groceries delivered. Two weeks before this admission, she and her son left home for a few hours to eat outdoors and spend time in a wooded area; they otherwise remained at home.
Six days before this admission, fever, chills, and myalgias developed. The next day, watery diarrhea occurred. The patient’s temperature measured at home was 38.3°C; fever persisted despite the intermittent administration of acetaminophen. Three days before this admission, a frontal headache developed, along with a dry cough that was associated with a self-limited episode of chest pain. The patient’s son had had no symptoms, except for a self-limited episode of diarrhea 2 weeks before the patient’s symptoms developed. On the day of admission, the patient continued to have fever, so she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing myalgias, headache, and cough. There was no nausea, vomiting, rash, shortness of breath, or anosmia. She had no notable medical history and took no medications. She was allergic to amoxicillin, with an unknown reaction. She did not smoke tobacco and drank alcohol rarely; she did not use illicit drugs. The patient lived in an urban area of New England and had traveled to Canada 6 months before this admission. She had a pet cat; there was no other animal contact.
On examination, the patient appeared anxious, but breathing was unlabored. The temperature was 38.9°C, the blood pressure 121/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% at rest and 98% during ambulation, both while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented to time, place, and person. There were no focal neurologic deficits. There was no meningism. The mucous membranes were dry. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without additional sounds or murmurs. There were vesicular breath sounds. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly. There was no rash. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Patrick P. Bourgouin: Chest radiography revealed low lung volumes, without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Dr. Castle: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen was negative, as was testing for adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Blood cultures were negative. Urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrites. The procalcitonin level was 0.36 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0.00 to 0.08). Intravenous fluids and acetaminophen were administered, and the heart rate decreased to 93 beats per minute. The patient was admitted to this hospital because of concerns that she had Covid-19.
On the second hospital day, the patient had ongoing diarrhea, headache, and cough, along with fatigue. The temperature was 40.2°C, the blood pressure 115/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 89 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The administration of intravenous fluids was continued. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing of a second nasopharyngeal specimen was negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On the third hospital day, the temperature was 38.7°C.
Dr. Bourgouin: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed interlobular septal thickening, mild ground-glass opacities at the lung bases, and small bilateral pleural effusions (Figure 1).
FIGURE 1

CT of the Chest.
Dr. Castle: During the next 3 days, the patient had ongoing myalgias, headache, and cough. Fever persisted, and the oxygen saturation remained normal. Urine antigen testing for legionella and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens was negative, as was screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 and nucleic acid testing of a blood specimen for cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus. Blood cultures remained negative.
On the seventh hospital day, diarrhea resolved, but fever, myalgias, headache, and cough persisted. The physical examination was unchanged, with a normal oxygen saturation during ambulation.
Dr. Bourgouin: Chest radiography revealed no evidence of pneumonia.
Dr. Castle: The procalcitonin level was 0.57 ng per milliliter; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Levofloxacin was administered. On the eighth hospital day, fever resolved but headache and fatigue persisted.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Anaplasmosis
Case 8-2022: A 54-Year-Old Woman with Episodes of Swelling,"Dr. Neelam A. Phadke: A 54-year-old woman with a history of episodic swelling of the arms, hands, and feet was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Twenty-three years before the current presentation, swelling of the left hand developed after the patient sustained a human bite. The swelling was associated with mild pruritus, erythema, and warmth. The swelling was well demarcated, involved only the left hand, and resolved after 3 days without specific treatment.
Twenty-two years before the current presentation, the patient had epigastric pain that radiated to her back, with associated nausea. Results of an upper gastrointestinal series, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were reportedly normal. The abdominal pain resolved, but two similar self-limited episodes occurred during the next year. No cause for the abdominal pain was identified.
During the next 3 years, episodes of self-limited swelling occurred once per year; one episode involved the right foot, one the left hand, and one the right hand. There were no clear triggers for the episodes, although they tended to occur after exposure to cold or after minor trauma, such as scratching.
Eighteen years before the current presentation, episodes of swelling of the hands and feet began to occur on a monthly basis, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital after an episode of swelling of the left hand. A skin-biopsy specimen reportedly showed sparse superficial dermal perivascular and interstitial mixed inflammatory infiltrate and stromal edema. Treatment with prednisone was initiated. The swelling of the left hand resolved after 3 days, and the patient was referred to the allergy clinic of this hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency was made on the basis of low levels of C1 esterase inhibitor, C4, and C1q. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal, and tests for antinuclear antibodies were negative. The patient was evaluated in the allergy clinic of a third hospital, and treatment with daily danazol was initiated. The episodes of swelling of the hands and feet resolved.

Ten years before the current presentation, episodes of swelling of the eyelids and upper lip occurred with associated pruritus. The episodes began with a sensation of facial flushing, pruritus of the scalp, and a raised pruritic rash on the face and chest; at times, these episodes were accompanied by shortness of breath, chest tightness, itchy throat, and red eyes. The patient was evaluated in the allergy clinic of the third hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The dose of danazol was increased, and the patient was instructed to take hydroxyzine as needed during episodes of swelling that were associated with pruritus.
The swelling episodes associated with pruritus occurred with variable frequency (several times per week to once every few months) but resolved within 30 minutes after the administration of hydroxyzine. Cetirizine was substituted for hydroxyzine for acute episodes. Treatment with daily loratadine and ranitidine was initiated, and the episodes of swelling with pruritus decreased in frequency.
Four months before the current presentation, swelling of the right arm developed after venipuncture. There was no associated pruritus. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. Ultrasonography of the arm showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and the patient was discharged from the emergency department. The swelling resolved after 3 days.
Two weeks before the current presentation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed. The patient attributed her symptoms to food poisoning, since her daughter had similar symptoms; the symptoms resolved after 3 days.
One week before the current presentation, epigastric pain developed; the pain was burning in character, worsened with consumption of food, and abated with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient was evaluated at a fourth hospital, where CT of the abdomen reportedly revealed inflammation of the duodenum and jejunum. A proton-pump inhibitor was administered, and the abdominal pain decreased. The patient was instructed not to take NSAIDs and was discharged home. However, during the next week, abdominal pain recurred, along with new symptoms of poor appetite and early satiety. She presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further care.
Other history included hypertension, low-back pain, and osteoporosis; she had undergone previous appendectomy and cesarean section. The patient also had a subepithelial duodenal mass, measuring 7 mm in diameter, that had been stable in size during the past 5 years; ultrasonographic images had shown that the mass was consistent with a benign stromal cell neoplasm. Medications included amlodipine, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, omeprazole, ranitidine, loratadine, and danazol, as well as cetirizine as needed. The patient had no known medication allergies but was allergic to iodinated contrast material. She was originally from Bangladesh and now lived with her husband and two children in a suburban community in New England and worked as a teacher. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension. The patient reported no similar episodes of swelling in either of her parents.
On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 106/81 mm Hg, the pulse 74 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was mildly distended with normal bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness on palpation, without rebound or involuntary guarding. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of lipase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, troponin, and thyrotropin. The alanine aminotransferase level was 49 IU per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and the aspartate aminotransferase level was 52 IU per liter (reference range, 9 to 32).
Dr. Ravi Gottumukkala: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of oral or intravenous contrast material, revealed long-segment marked circumferential thickening of the jejunal wall with associated mesenteric edema and small-volume free intraperitoneal fluid. The remainder of the small bowel and colon showed no abnormalities (Figure 1).

Dr. Phadke: Diagnostic tests were performed, and treatment decisions were made.",Hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency and chronic spontaneous urticaria.
"Case 7-2022: A 65-Year-Old Woman with Depression, Recurrent Falls, and Inability to Care for Herself","Dr. Diana L. Stern (Psychiatry): A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of depression, recurrent falls, and difficulty caring for herself.
Four years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of depression that was precipitated by psychosocial stressors. She was treated with bupropion, citalopram, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The depression was well controlled until 1 year before the current admission, when she began to have anhedonia, decreased energy, sadness, and poor concentration. She resumed cognitive behavioral therapy, but her symptoms worsened during the next 4 months, and she had suicidal ideation. The dose of bupropion was increased, and treatment with trazodone was started.
Fourteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident that was attributed to her falling asleep while driving. After the accident, she reported increased sadness, low energy, and inability to perform her usual activities. One week later, she fell and struck her head, and she was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that, before her fall, she had been feeling unsteady because of weakness in the left leg. A physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hypodensities involving the subcortical and periventricular white matter, findings consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital and was discharged home.
During the next week, the patient had balance difficulties and began using a walker. When she was evaluated in the neurology clinic, she reported imbalance and occasional nausea. On examination, she had a depressed affect. Strength was assessed as 5−/5 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, and patellar tendons and were absent at the ankles, with downgoing toes. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with mild dragging of the left leg. A diagnosis of postconcussive syndrome was considered, and treatment with ondansetron was started for nausea. Additional tests were performed.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased signal intensity in the pons and in a periventricular distribution on T2-weighted imaging, without associated contrast enhancement. There was a region of decreased signal intensity in the right corona radiata on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Results of electroencephalography were normal, as were results of electromyography and nerve-conduction studies of the left leg. Physical therapy was recommended, and repeat MRI was planned for 6 weeks later.
Over the next 6-week period, during sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, the patient was noted to be less talkative, with slow processing, impaired recall, and mild inattention. Repeat MRI with angiography performed 6 weeks after the first study revealed patchy hyperintensity involving the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, and corticospinal tract bilaterally on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, without contrast enhancement; the cerebral vasculature was normal.
The patient had recurrent falls without loss of consciousness and began using a wheelchair. She reported worsening sadness, anxiety, and anhedonia, and treatment with buspirone was started. On evaluation in the neurology clinic 6 weeks before the current admission, testing of leg strength yielded inconsistent results, but strength in both legs was assessed as 5−/5 with maximum effort. Dragging of the left leg was also noted to be inconsistent. There were concerns that her depression might be contributing to her neurologic changes, and further follow-up with the psychiatric service was recommended.
Five weeks before the current admission, the patient’s husband brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for an evaluation of worsening memory impairment, poor self-care, and frequent falls. The patient had stopped participating in physical therapy and was spending most of the day in bed. She reported that she had lost 14 kg during the previous 4 months. Other medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and osteoarthritis of the knees. There was a history of postpartum depression 27 years earlier that had lasted for several months. Medications included amlodipine, buspirone, bupropion, cholecalciferol, citalopram, metformin, and trazodone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband in a suburb of Boston and worked as a teacher. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol only occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of anxiety and depression in her seventh decade of life. Her sister had a history of stroke.
On examination, the patient appeared tired and disheveled, with psychomotor retardation. Strength in both legs was assessed as 5/5. She had a monoplegic gait, with buckling of the left leg, when walking down a hallway, but she had a normal gait when walking on a treadmill. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 25, indicating mild cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The complete blood count, results of liver-function and kidney-function tests, and blood levels of cobalamin, thyrotropin, and electrolytes were normal. Screening for syphilis, Lyme disease, and the human immunodeficiency virus was negative, as was urine toxicologic screening. After an evaluation by a neurology consultant, the patient was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit.
While the patient was in the hospital, the dose of citalopram was tapered, and treatment with desvenlafaxine and amphetamine–dextroamphetamine was started; her levels of attention and wakefulness increased. She participated in group psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational and physical therapy. She continued to have variable weakness in the left leg and had three witnessed falls, during which she reportedly had fatigue and lowered herself to the ground.
On hospital day 11, the patient reported being unable to use her left arm because of weakness. Although her left arm rested across her chest for most of the day, she was observed holding her husband’s hand with her left hand when saying goodbye. On evaluation by a neurology consultant, strength in the left arm was assessed as 5/5. The working diagnosis was functional neurologic disorder. On hospital day 12, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center.
At the rehabilitation center, the patient received physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medications to treat depression. During the first week, she made progress toward independence in bathing, toileting, and grooming but had limited attention, memory, and problem solving. During the second week, she became more withdrawn. There was a paucity of speech with hypophonia, decreased attention, and less eye contact with visitors who sat on her left side than with visitors who sat on her right side. During the third week, the patient stopped answering questions and following commands. She was evaluated again in the emergency department of this hospital.
On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 141/90 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was withdrawn and minimally interactive. She was able to state her name but not the date or location. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side and did not track the examiner’s finger past the midline to the left. There was flattening of the left nasolabial fold. The left arm was hypertonic and held in flexion; there was no spontaneous movement of the left arm or leg, and she declined to participate in a strength examination. She did not withdraw the left arm in response to nail-bed pressure; she withdrew the left foot with antigravity movement in response to tactile stimulation.
The white-cell count was 12,940 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with a normal differential count. The remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
"Case 6-2022: A 68-Year-Old Man with Fatigue, Weight Loss, and Hyperglycemia","Dr. Adith Sekaran (Medicine): A 68-year-old man with metastatic melanoma was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital because of fatigue and weight loss.
Six years before the current evaluation, the patient received a diagnosis of superficial spreading melanoma of the left shoulder. He was treated with a wide local excision; a biopsy of the sentinel lymph node was negative for melanoma. One year before the current evaluation, the patient began to have slurred speech and weakness in the left hand. Imaging revealed a mass lesion in the parietal lobe of the brain and another mass in the hilum of the left lung. Craniotomy with resection of the brain mass was performed; pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with melanoma, as did a biopsy of the lung mass. Seizures developed postoperatively, and treatment with levetiracetam was initiated. Further treatment included radiation therapy targeting the parietal resection cavity and the administration of pembrolizumab.
Four months before the current evaluation, after seven cycles of pembrolizumab, the blood thyrotropin level was 9.4 μIU per milliliter (reference range, 0.4 to 5.0) and the free thyroxine level 0.9 ng per deciliter (12 pmol per liter; reference range, 0.9 to 1.8 ng per deciliter [12 to 23 pmol per liter]); treatment with levothyroxine was initiated. Three months before the current evaluation, after eight cycles of pembrolizumab, exertional angina developed, and the patient underwent coronary catheterization with placement of two drug-eluting stents. Pembrolizumab treatment was resumed 1 month later.
When the patient presented to the oncology clinic for a planned infusion of pembrolizumab, he reported a 3-week history of fatigue and a 2-week history of increased thirst and nocturia, with a need to urinate as many as three times each night. Although there was no change in appetite or eating habits, he had lost 5 kg of weight in the previous 3 weeks. There was no headache or change in vision.
On examination, the temperature was 36.4°C, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the blood pressure 128/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.0. Heart sounds were regular, with no murmur. Lung sounds were normal. There was no leg edema. Muscle bulk was normal, as was strength in the arms and legs. There was no rash, bruising, or change in skin tone. Other history included hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, levetiracetam, levothyroxine, metoprolol, and pembrolizumab. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. The patient lived in New England and was a retired police officer. His father, sister, and brother had had melanoma. There was no family history of diabetes.
A complete blood count, the results of liver-function tests, and the blood thyrotropin level were normal. The blood glucose level was 505 mg per deciliter (28.03 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.89 to 6.11 mmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Case 5-2022: A 65-Year-Old Woman with Rapidly Progressive Weakness in the Right Arm and Recurrent Falls,"Dr. Marina Avetisyan (Neurology, Brigham and Women’s Hospital): A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of rapidly progressive weakness in the right arm and recurrent falls.
Twelve years before this admission, the patient noted worsening gait and balance disturbance, which slowly progressed, and falls began to occur 5 years before this admission. Her medical history included measles encephalitis, which had been diagnosed when she was 6 years of age and had resulted in weakness on the left side, severe vision and hearing impairment, and gait and balance disturbance. After rehabilitation therapy, her balance and gait apparently normalized, but she had mild residual weakness on the left side, which resulted in a change from left-hand to right-hand dominance.
Two years before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She reported difficulties with balance, which worsened with head turning. She reported no disequilibrium, vertigo, back pain, paresthesia, or numbness. On examination, her cognitive function was intact, and although her speech was dysarthric and hypophonic, these abnormalities could have been associated with her hearing loss. The cranial-nerve examination revealed abnormal eye movements, with square-wave jerks, saccadic pursuit, and bilateral horizontal nystagmus. The hearing and vision were severely reduced. The muscle bulk was decreased throughout, and tone was normal. Motor strength was full and symmetric in the arms and legs bilaterally, and contractures were present in the fingers of the left hand. Reflexes were reduced or absent throughout, and plantar reflexes were extensor bilaterally. Vibratory sensation was reduced at the great toes but was otherwise normal. The patient had appendicular dysmetria on both finger-to-nose testing and heel-to-shin testing that was greater on the left side than on the right side. Her gait was wide-based, and she was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg sign was present.
Needle electromyographic findings and the results of nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine revealed mild multilevel degenerative disk disease without clinically significant spinal-canal stenosis. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 0 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and oligoclonal bands were absent. Tests of the CSF and serum for antibodies associated with autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis were negative (Table 1). The patient underwent physical therapy, and her symptoms stabilized.

Three months before this admission, weakness in the right hand and right arm developed. The patient initially attributed the weakness to fatigue, since it had occurred during a time of increased physical activity associated with moving to a different apartment. However, the weakness did not abate, and 2 months before this admission, she was again evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She noted difficulty with communicating in sign language and with holding objects in her right hand because of weakness and had started using her left hand to eat. She reported no neck, arm, or leg pain and no sensory loss. Her gait and balance were stable, with no recent falls.
On examination, there was reduced facial expression and reduced muscle bulk and tone throughout. The right shoulder was dropped, with weakness in the right trapezius and reduced active shoulder abduction that was limited to 70 degrees, without pain on shoulder abduction. There was predominantly proximal weakness in the right arm; the muscle strength was 4−/5 on shoulder abduction and external rotation, 4+/5 on elbow flexion, and 4/5 on elbow extension, wrist extension, and abductor digiti minimi and finger extension. The strength in the right leg was normal. There was subtle weakness on the left side that involved wrist and finger extension and great toe extension. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right biceps and 1+ at the left biceps and were otherwise areflexic throughout. Sensation was intact in the arms, but there was decreased vibratory sensation and proprioception at the great toes; sensation was otherwise normal. Moderate appendicular dysmetria was present in the arms and legs. The patient’s gait, which was assessed while she was using her white cane (the type of cane commonly used by blind or visually impaired persons), was wide-based; she took excessively large steps and reached out once to touch the wall. Neurologic examination was otherwise unchanged from the examination performed 2 years earlier. Additional studies were obtained.
Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was reported to be normal. MRI of the cervical spine was also performed without the administration of contrast material; T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed signal hyperintensity in the suboccipital and paraspinal soft tissues that was consistent with edema. Areas of intrinsic hyperintense signal that were consistent with fatty atrophy were seen on T1-weighted imaging. There were diffuse degenerative changes with mild spinal-canal stenosis at C4–C5, without cord compression.
Dr. Avetisyan: Repeat needle electromyography revealed no recorded motor units in the right deltoid or infraspinatus muscles, with complex repetitive discharges in the right cervical paraspinal and deltoid muscles. Nerve-conduction studies revealed mild reduction in the amplitudes of the bilateral median and right ulnar sensory responses; the sensory responses of the right radial, bilateral antebrachial cutaneous, and bilateral medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves were normal, as were the motor responses of the right median and right ulnar nerves.
During the ensuing 2 months, the weakness in the right arm progressed rapidly, which caused the patient to have difficulty ambulating with her white cane (she was unable to walk with a standard cane), making walking unsafe after frequent falls and rendering her practically bedbound. She had no pain or numbness in her arm. She was ultimately unable to care for herself at home and was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation.
Other medical history included hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism. Medications included ascorbic acid, vitamin B complex, coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, calcium carbonate and cholecalciferol, and levothyroxine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone and worked for a nonprofit agency. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank four glasses of wine per week, and did not use illicit drugs. She reported that her father had died from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease when he was 71 years of age, 7 months after the onset of symptoms. Her mother had Alzheimer’s disease, which was diagnosed when she was in her 60s; she was currently living in a nursing home. The patient had four siblings; one had died at 46 years of age from an intracerebral hemorrhage, and her remaining three siblings were well.
On examination, the temperature was 35.7°C, the blood pressure 116/64 mm Hg, the pulse 61 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 15.8. The patient appeared emaciated but was able to sit up in a chair and hold her head up. Strength in her right arm had decreased to 2/5 on shoulder shrug, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, and elbow extension, with 3/5 strength on wrist extension and finger flexion and extension. There was new proximal weakness in the right leg, with 4/5 strength on right hip flexion. The strength in the left arm was unchanged. Deep-tendon reflexes were 3+ at the right biceps and 2+ at the brachioradialis and were otherwise absent throughout. She had ataxia as well as occasional jerks that involved the legs (with the left leg affected to a greater extent than the right leg) and were possibly stimulus-induced. The remainder of the neurologic examination was unchanged from the last visit.
Dr. Schaefer: MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a new linear signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging but also a marked decrease in subtle restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging and hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging (identified in retrospect on the previous MRI) in the left frontal and left parietal lobes (Figure 1). MRI of the whole spine, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was unchanged from previous imaging.

Dr. Avetisyan: The creatine kinase level was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed.",Genetic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.
Case 4-2022: A 55-Year-Old Man with Bilateral Hearing Loss and Eye Redness,"Dr. Mia Y. Bothwell (Medicine): A 55-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of bilateral hearing loss and eye redness.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when a headache involving the left temple developed. A similar headache had occurred during an episode of shingles 15 years earlier. He received a prescription for a 1-week course of valacyclovir for the treatment of presumed shingles. No skin lesions developed, and the headache resolved.
Four weeks before the current evaluation, hearing loss in the left ear developed during an airplane flight. The hearing loss persisted after the flight, and the patient began to have intermittent tinnitus in the left ear and redness in both eyes. He was evaluated by an otolaryngologist at a clinic affiliated with this hospital. He reported no vertigo, otorrhea, rhinitis, or sore throat. On examination, there was redness in both eyes. The right and left auricles and external auditory canals were normal, as was the right tympanic membrane. The left tympanic membrane was retracted; there was no middle-ear effusion. Results of the Weber test were inconsistent. The Rinne test was positive bilaterally, with air conduction greater than bone conduction. There was no sinus tenderness. Nasopharyngoscopy revealed midseptal deviation to the left; the posterior aspect of the nasopharynx was normal. The remainder of the examination, including a cranial nerve examination, was normal.
An audiogram showed sloping mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. Results were asymmetric at low frequencies, with more severe hearing loss in the left ear than in the right ear from 125 to 2000 Hz (Figure 1A). Word recognition was 96% with the right ear and 84% with the left ear (reference range, 80 to 100). Results of tympanometry were normal in both ears. The patient received a prescription for a 12-day tapering course of oral prednisone. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormal findings.
FIGURE 1

Audiograms.
Four weeks later, the patient was evaluated by a different otolaryngologist at the clinic affiliated with this hospital. Hearing loss had progressed. Eye redness had initially decreased after prednisone therapy was started but had subsequently recurred after prednisone therapy was stopped. On examination, there was redness in both eyes. There was no spontaneous nystagmus or gait ataxia. Sinusoidal gaze tracking was normal. The head-thrust test to the left was positive, a finding that indicates vestibular hypofunction on the left side. Results of the Romberg test were normal. The Fukuda step test was positive, with the patient rotated to the left, a finding that also indicates vestibular hypofunction on the left side. A repeat audiogram showed worsening of sensorineural hearing loss and reduction of word recognition to 90% with the right ear and 64% with the left ear (Figure 1B). Results of tympanometry were normal. The patient was referred for an urgent rheumatologic evaluation.
Three days later, in the rheumatology clinic at this hospital, the patient reported ongoing hearing loss in both ears and redness in both eyes, as well as the recent onset of imbalance. He also reported that he had had fatigue and intermittent body aches for 2 months and that he had lost 5 kg of weight over a 6-month period. There was no history of oral or genital lesions; 6 weeks earlier, a nonpruritic patchy rash had developed on his torso after he received the influenza vaccine and had rapidly resolved with the use of an oral antihistamine. There was a history of irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulosis, gastritis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. Medications included intranasal and inhaled fluticasone, vitamin B12, and omeprazole. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his wife in an urban area of New England. For the past 12 years, he had been sexually active with his wife only. He was a retired construction worker. He was a nonsmoker, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs.
On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 115/79 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There was redness in both eyes. The finger-rub test revealed grossly reduced hearing in both ears. The Romberg test was positive when the patient’s eyes were open, a finding that indicates vestibular or cerebellar hypofunction. The remainder of the examination, including skin, joint, and neurologic assessments, was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The complete blood count with differential count was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13), and the C-reactive protein level 12.3 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). The patient was referred for an urgent ophthalmologic evaluation at this hospital, which was to take place on the same day.
On ophthalmologic evaluation, the patient reported no blurred vision, floaters, eye pain, itching, or photophobia. He wore contact lenses, which he changed daily. On examination, visual acuity was normal in both eyes. The right cornea had trace pinpoint epithelial deposits, a peripheral ring of punctate epithelial erosions, and several small confluent areas of punctate epithelial erosions centrally, with no infiltrate. The left cornea had a peripheral ring of punctate epithelial erosions and several confluent areas of punctate epithelial erosions centrally, with no infiltrate. There was evidence of anterior uveitis, with 7 cells per high-power field in the right anterior chamber and 6 to 7 cells per high-power field in the left anterior chamber. There was trace flare in both eyes.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Neurosyphilis.
"Case 3-2022: A 14-Year-Old Boy with Fever, Joint Pain, and Abdominal Cramping","Dr. Micaela Atkins (Pediatrics): A 14-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of fatigue, fever, joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea.
The patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when fatigue and fever developed on his final day of summer camp. He was taken to the primary care clinic at another hospital and was told that he had a viral infection.
Nine days before this admission, new mild sore throat developed, and the patient returned to the primary care clinic. A throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was reportedly negative. The patient was told that he had possible sinusitis, and treatment with amoxicillin–clavulanate was started. During the next 3 days, the sore throat abated, but fatigue and fever persisted.
Six days before this admission, new pain in the right shoulder and left knee developed, and the patient again returned to the primary care clinic. The white-cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reportedly elevated; a blood test for Lyme disease was performed.
On the day of admission, the joint pain progressed to involve the shoulders and knees on both sides, and the temperature increased to 39.4°C. The patient was given ibuprofen and brought to the emergency department at this hospital. On evaluation, the patient described aching pain in the shoulders and knees, which was worst in his right shoulder and left knee. He rated the pain at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had not noticed redness, swelling, or stiffness of the joints. A review of systems was notable for chills, intermittent night sweats, headache, myalgias, and lightheadedness when he stood up from a sitting position. He had no weight loss, rash, vision changes, or respiratory symptoms. He had mild abdominal cramping, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea. During the past week, there had been a few episodes of nonbloody emesis and watery diarrhea. There had been no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.
The patient had autism spectrum disorder, with an early delay in speech development that had resolved after speech therapy. He had met milestones for gross and fine motor skills and growth. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. Other history included asthma, seasonal rhinosinusitis, and allergies to peanuts and tree nuts; there were no known drug allergies. He had undergone a tonsillectomy in early childhood. Medications included amoxicillin–clavulanate, inhaled fluticasone, and ibuprofen and inhaled albuterol as needed.
At the time of admission, the patient was on his summer break before entering high school. Earlier in the summer, he had gone on vacation to a coastal area of New England. He had also attended camp in a rural area of New England, where he camped and hiked in wooded areas and swam in fresh water. He had seen a tick on his clothing but did not recall any bites. Two weeks before this admission, the patient had returned to his home in a suburban area of New England, where he lived with his mother (who was a veterinarian), father, sister, and pet dog. His sister had recently had an acute gastrointestinal illness that resolved after several days. The patient was not sexually active and did not use alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. His mother had hypothyroidism, and his maternal uncle had rheumatoid arthritis; there was no other known family history of autoimmune diseases.
On examination, the temperature was 36.1°C, the blood pressure 128/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.2. The patient appeared to be well developed and well nourished, but he looked tired. The conjunctivae were normal. The mucous membranes were dry, and there was an aphthous ulcer on the right buccal mucosa. The lungs were clear on auscultation. There was tenderness on palpation of the epigastric and periumbilical abdomen. There was no erythema, warmth, swelling, or crepitus of the large and small joints. There was tenderness on palpation, as well as pain with movement, of the right shoulder and knees; range of motion in these joints was not decreased. The patient had no rash or lymphadenopathy.
The white-cell count was 12,950 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 48 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13), the C-reactive protein level 207.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the lipase level 82 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60).

While the patient was in the emergency department, the temperature increased to 39.2°C. Intravenous fluids were administered, and empirical treatment with doxycycline was started. The patient was admitted to the hospital.
During the next 2 days, the fever resolved, but the joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea worsened in severity. On the third hospital day, fever recurred. The white-cell count was 15,190 per microliter, the C-reactive protein level 178.3 mg per liter, and the lipase level 145 U per liter. A fecal occult blood test was positive. A plain film of the right shoulder was normal.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease).
Case 2-2022: A 70-Year-Old Man with a Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion,"Dr. Cory A. Perugino: A 70-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of a recurrent left pleural effusion.
Five years before this presentation, the patient had pain in the shoulders and proximal muscles of the arms and legs. The pain was worse in the morning and was associated with fatigue. There was no associated stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level were elevated. Prednisone was initiated for the treatment of a working diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica, and symptoms abated quickly. During the next year, attempts to discontinue prednisone led to recurrent myalgias, as well as elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level.
Three years before this presentation, swelling, erythema, and pain developed in the cartilaginous portion of the left ear, sparing the earlobe (Figure 1). There was no reduction in these symptoms after empirical antibacterial therapy was initiated for the treatment of presumed cellulitis. The dose of prednisone was increased, and the symptoms involving the ear resolved; however, they recurred when the dose of prednisone was tapered. Biopsy of the left auricle revealed perichondrial inflammation and degenerative changes in the cartilage. The dose of prednisone was increased for a presumed diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis. The symptoms involving the ear resolved, and weekly therapy with methotrexate was initiated.
FIGURE 1

Clinical Photographs.
During the next 6 months, attempts to taper the prednisone dose were associated with worsening inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms, along with elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was as high as 89 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13) and the C-reactive protein level as high as 73.6 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0).
Two years before this presentation, the patient began treatment with tocilizumab for fatigue, markedly elevated C-reactive protein level, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, all of which persisted despite treatment with prednisone and methotrexate. The administration of tocilizumab allowed for the tapering of prednisone to a lower dose without causing an exacerbation of inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms. Two weeks after the patient began receiving tocilizumab therapy, and upon tapering of the prednisone dose, pain and swelling developed in the right leg; ultrasound examination revealed a distal deep-vein thrombosis in the right posterior tibial vein. Repeat ultrasonography of the leg performed 2 weeks later did not show propagation of the deep-vein thrombosis, and the pain and swelling resolved with the continued use of a compression stocking and elevation of the right leg. However, 2 months later, when further tapering of the prednisone dose was started, inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms recurred, and pain and swelling developed in the left leg. Ultrasound examination revealed deep-vein thromboses in the left popliteal and left calf veins and in the right femoral vein; therapy with rivaroxaban was initiated. The development of recurrent deep-vein thromboses was attributed to the underlying inflammatory disease. The dose of prednisone was increased, methotrexate was continued, and tocilizumab was replaced with infliximab therapy.
During the next 6 months, the inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms worsened when attempts were made to taper the prednisone dose, and these conditions abated only when the dose of prednisone was increased. Blood tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), rheumatoid factor, and anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Fifteen months before this presentation, treatment with rituximab was initiated. However, after an attempt to taper the dose of prednisone, bilateral scleritis developed (Figure 1); the dose of prednisone was increased again, which resulted in resolution of the ocular pain and redness. During the next 3 months, attempts to taper the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent episodes of scleritis and inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms; additional rituximab treatment was not administered.
One year before the current presentation, treatment with low-dose cyclophosphamide was initiated, but the use of this medication was complicated by severe neutropenia, which did not allow for the dose to be escalated. Nine months before this presentation, treatment with cyclophosphamide was stopped, and intravenous tocilizumab was restarted, given its previous efficacy in this patient. However, the use of tocilizumab also resulted in moderate but transient neutropenia after each infusion.
Seven months before this presentation, pleuritic chest pain on the lower left side developed, along with dyspnea on exertion and a dry cough. Chest radiography revealed a moderate left pleural effusion (Figure 2A and 2B). Thoracentesis was performed, and 1 liter of straw-colored pleural fluid was removed; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Gram’s staining of the pleural fluid revealed abundant polymorphonuclear cells but no organisms; bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures were without growth. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid revealed no malignant cells. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (performed after the pleural fluid was drained) showed a small left pleural effusion, a trace right pleural effusion, and bibasilar dependent atelectasis without consolidation, nodules, or lymphadenopathy (Figure 2C). The pleural effusions were attributed to ongoing inflammatory disease. The dose of prednisone was increased, and the pleurisy and dyspnea resolved. Five months before this presentation, tocilizumab therapy was stopped, and tofacitinib was initiated. One week before this presentation, the patient had sudden onset of back pain on the left side. Imaging studies were performed.

Dr. Vincent V. Dinculescu: CT of the chest and abdomen, performed 6 months after the first CT of the chest, revealed a small left pleural effusion that was larger than it had been on the first chest CT (Figure 2D). A punctate stone in the lower pole of the left kidney was also observed, with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Dr. Perugino: The patient presented to the rheumatology clinic for further evaluation. He had no dyspnea, cough, or fever. On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, the blood pressure 145/75 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.2. There was no scleral redness or erythema of the helix of the ear. The heart sounds were regular. Breath sounds were decreased at the base of the left lung. There was no leg edema, joint swelling or tenderness, purpura, petechiae, or deficits in motor strength.
The patient had a history of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cecum, which had been diagnosed 10 years before this presentation and had been treated with laparoscopic colectomy of the right side of the colon and with oxaliplatin therapy, without evidence of recurrence. Other history included peripheral neuropathy (attributed to the oxaliplatin therapy), hypothyroidism, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Macrocytic anemia had been present for 3 years before this presentation, with normal blood levels of cobalamin and folate. The patient also had a history of leukopenia and neutropenia; these conditions had occurred intermittently over the course of the 10 years preceding this presentation but were most pronounced after treatment with cyclophosphamide and tocilizumab. Medications included alendronate, atorvastatin, cholecalciferol, folic acid, levothyroxine, methotrexate, omeprazole, prednisone, rivaroxaban, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, and tofacitinib. The patient drank alcohol occasionally; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He lived in New England and was retired. There was no family history of autoimmune disease.
The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
A diagnostic test was performed, and management decisions were made.","VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome."
Case 1-2022: A 67-Year-Old Man with Motor Neuron Disease and Odd Behaviors during Sleep,"Dr. Suma Babu: A 67-year-old man was evaluated in the sleep clinic at this hospital because of odd behaviors during sleep, daytime sleepiness, and apnea detected on a home sleep study.
Three years before the current evaluation, the patient’s wife noticed that the patient had vocalizations, including talking and yelling, while sleeping. He also had thrashing movements while sleeping; he fell out of bed more than once and inadvertently hit his wife during these movements.
Two years before the current evaluation, the patient’s wife noticed that the patient had prolonged episodes of daytime sleepiness. During the episodes, he appeared to fall asleep while sitting up and was unresponsive to shaking and loud voices; several hours later, he returned to normal interaction without any intervention. The daytime sleepiness was intermittent and fluctuated in severity.
Four months before the current evaluation, the patient fell asleep while washing dishes. This resulted in a fall and unstable C1 spinal fracture, which required urgent surgical repair. After the surgical repair, melatonin and trazodone were prescribed for insomnia, and abnormal movements during sleep abated. However, vocalizations during sleep — including singing, talking, and expression of fear and anger in the context of upsetting dreams — continued and were most prominent in the early morning hours.
The patient also had a motor neurologic syndrome that had started before the onset of sleep symptoms, approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation. Symptoms included progressive gait imbalance with falls, hand clumsiness, hoarse voice, and dysphagia. Serial neurologic examinations, performed over a 3-year period by multiple neuromuscular specialists, revealed slow progression of generalized fasciculations and the development of bulbar hyperreflexia, postural instability, and hypophonia, although strength in the arms and legs remained intact. Serial electromyography revealed progressive and widespread involvement of muscles showing chronic reinnervation changes, including eventual involvement of craniobulbar muscles (tongue and masseter muscles).
Dr. Brian Zhao: One year before the current evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine revealed moderate neural foraminal narrowing at the level of C3–C4 bilaterally and no central canal stenosis. Four months before the current evaluation, MRI of the head revealed a punctate subacute infarct in the left posterior centrum semiovale, chronic infarcts in the left middle frontal gyrus and right cerebellum, and nonspecific moderate-to-severe white-matter changes (Figure 1).
FIGURE 1

MRI of the Head.
Dr. Babu: Blood tests for paraneoplastic, nutritional, and paraproteinemic causes of the patient’s neurologic syndrome were unrevealing. A diagnosis of slowly progressive motor neuron disease was made, and therapy with riluzole was begun. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study revealed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with laryngeal penetration and silent aspiration; a gastrostomy tube was placed, and tube feeding was initiated.
The patient underwent a home sleep-apnea test, which showed sleep-disordered breathing with an apnea–hypopnea index of 20 events per hour; hypoxemia was present at rest while he was breathing ambient air. Severe oxygen desaturation occurred with frequent respiratory events while he was asleep in the supine position. The patient was then referred to the sleep clinic for an initial evaluation.
On evaluation in the sleep clinic, the patient reported that obstructive sleep apnea had been diagnosed on the basis of a home sleep study performed 1 year earlier. Multiple attempts at treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) had been unsuccessful; there had been difficulty in finding a mask that fit comfortably.
In addition to the sleep and motor neurologic syndrome described previously, the patient’s symptoms included snoring, difficulty with sleep initiation, forgetfulness, poor judgment regarding his ability to safely complete physical tasks, urinary urgency and frequency, and night sweats. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was well controlled with insulin and had been complicated by mild, stable, length-dependent sensory polyneuropathy; other history included hyperlipidemia, a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, depression, orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included alprazolam, bupropion, fenofibrate, insulin, melatonin, metformin, riluzole, sertraline, and trazodone; there were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in New England with his wife. He was a retired engineer. He drank two alcoholic beverages per day. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had died from an unknown cause at an elderly age; his father had died from trauma. One of his brothers had cerebrovascular disease, and another had schizophrenia.
On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 112/60 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.2. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented, although his attention was somewhat diminished. He could recall two words out of three. Naming and repetition were intact. The pupils were equally reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements were intact, and visual fields were full. Facial sensation and strength were normal. Speech was hypophonic and mildly slurred. Elevation of the palate was symmetric, and movement of the tongue was normal. Shoulder shrug was symmetric. Strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups. Deep-tendon reflexes were brisk in the arms, with mild spasticity in the legs. Plantar responses were normal. Vibratory sensation in the legs was mildly diminished. Results of finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing were normal. There were mild myoclonic movements in both hands. Alternating movements were mildly clumsy. Tone was slightly increased in the legs. The gait was on a narrow base and was unsteady; the patient was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg test showed truncal titubation.
A sleep study to determine the appropriate positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy was performed. In CPAP mode, there was good control of respiratory events. Electromyographic signals revealed elevated muscle tone during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, but there were no abnormal behaviors.
Two weeks later, during a follow-up visit in the neuromuscular clinic, the patient became unresponsive to sternal rub; the vital signs and blood glucose level were normal. He was transported to the emergency department, where he returned to a normal level of consciousness without intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed frequent intermittent diffuse polymorphic delta slowing of the background, often with bifrontal predominance, but showed no epileptiform abnormalities. The patient was fitted with a mask for CPAP, and treatment was initiated. Several weeks after the initiation of treatment, download of CPAP data revealed good effectiveness and adherence.
However, episodes of unresponsiveness increased in frequency and lasted up to 3 hours at a time. During the episodes, the patient’s wife was unable to arouse him despite performing a sternal rub. Modafinil was prescribed, but the episodes did not abate. The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for long-term monitoring and EEG. During the admission, two episodes of unresponsiveness occurred, during which the patient had a normal blood pressure, heart rate, and glucose level and EEG revealed findings consistent with sleep.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Anti-IgLON5 IgG–associated neurologic disorder.
"Case 40-2021: A 9-Year-Old Boy with Transient Weakness, Facial Droop, and Slurred Speech","Dr. Sagar M. Raju (Pediatrics): A 9-year-old boy was transferred to this hospital because of transient weakness and facial droop on the left side and slurred speech.
The patient had been well until 5 hours before this evaluation, when his parents observed that he had a facial droop on the left side and slurred speech. In addition, the patient noticed that his left arm and leg felt “limp.” When he moved to get out of his bed, he could not stand on his own or grip using the left hand. There was no confusion, loss of consciousness, shaking in the arms or legs, urinary or fecal incontinence, headache, nausea, vomiting, recent illness, or trauma. The symptoms lasted approximately 2 minutes and then resolved completely. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital.
At the other hospital, the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and troponin were normal, as were the results of tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation.
On arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from the patient’s parents. Earlier in the day, the patient had become upset while visiting his grandfather, who was dying of esophageal cancer. He then played a game of hockey with a sibling; no falls or head trauma occurred. At the time that his parents observed the new neurologic symptoms, he had been lying in bed and crying profusely and inconsolably for an extended period. His parents noticed that he was gasping for air and hiccupping while crying.
The patient had been born by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at full term. He had met normal developmental milestones and had received routine childhood vaccinations. He had chronic gastrointestinal upset that had been attributed to anxiety. Two years earlier, he had been evaluated at the neurology clinic of another hospital because of episodes of shaking in the arms and legs, which occurred multiple times a day. The shaking occurred more frequently when the patient was excited or emotional. He was aware of the shaking; he felt an urge before each episode, and the urge was relieved after the shaking occurred. His parents were told that the shaking was stereotypy, and no diagnostic tests were performed.
The patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He lived with his parents and two siblings in a suburban area of New England. He attended elementary school and performed well academically, although he received tutoring for mild difficulties with reading and phonology. In addition to the history of esophageal cancer in his paternal grandfather, his father had ulcerative colitis, his mother had received a diagnosis of large-B-cell lymphoma in childhood, his sister had asthma, and his maternal grandfather had died of acute coronary syndrome at 30 years of age.
On evaluation, the patient appeared well developed and mildly anxious. The temperature was 37.2°C, the blood pressure 116/64 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The face was symmetric, with normal forehead wrinkling, blinking, smiling, and cheek puffing. An evaluation of other cranial-nerve functions, sensation, power, bulk, tone, coordination, and gait was normal.
A diagnostic test result was reviewed, and a diagnosis was made.",Moyamoya disease.
Case 39-2021: A 26-Year-Old Woman with Respiratory Failure and Altered Mental Status,"Dr. Viral S. Shah: A 26-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of respiratory failure and altered mental status.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current admission, when she underwent elective abdominoplasty and liposuction at an ambulatory surgery center. During the procedure, anesthetic agents included intravenous propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, and ketamine, as well as local lidocaine injections. During recovery after the procedure, medications included intravenous cefazolin, enoxaparin, and ondansetron; oral oxycodone, tramadol, and gabapentin; and transdermal scopolamine. The patient was lethargic after the procedure but was able to be discharged home after a period of observation.
Later that day, the patient was instructed by telephone to take a lower dose of postoperative oxycodone. The next day, on evaluation at the surgical center, she was found to be somnolent but arousable and able to answer questions with effort; the scopolamine patch was removed. Several hours after the patient returned home, her family noticed that she had increased respiratory effort and minimal responsiveness. She was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of a local hospital.
In the emergency department, the temperature was 37.7°C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/77 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 83% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was lethargic, moaned intermittently, and responded with one-word answers; symmetric movement in the arms and legs was observed. Intravenous naloxone was administered, with minor improvement in her condition. Levels of electrolytes and results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, rightward axis deviation, and nonspecific ST–T-wave changes.

Dr. Dexter P. Mendoza: A chest radiograph showed diffuse confluent opacities in both lungs (Figure 1A). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary-embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed diffuse mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving all lobes of the lungs, with relative sparing of the subpleural lung (Figure 1B). CT of the abdomen revealed postoperative changes. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild effacement of the cerebral sulci and cisterns on both sides, a finding suggestive of mild diffuse cerebral edema (Figure 1C and 1D). There was also a small hypodensity in the left globus pallidus, a finding suggestive of infarction.
FIGURE 1

Initial Imaging Studies.
Dr. Shah: Noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the other hospital. Intravenous vancomycin, piperacillin–tazobactam, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir were administered empirically, and a triple-lumen central venous catheter was inserted.
The next morning, the findings on a repeat chest radiograph appeared to be unchanged, but the patient had progressive lethargy, so intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Pink frothy secretions were noted. Intravenous methylprednisolone, propofol, and norepinephrine were administered. A nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. The troponin I level increased to 4.31 ng per milliliter (reference range, <0.029). The thyrotropin, carboxyhemoglobin, and lipase levels were normal, and tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigens were negative.
Later that afternoon, the patient was transferred to the ICU at this hospital. A review of systems was unavailable because intubation was performed on arrival. Medical history that was obtained from family members included iron-deficiency anemia, anxiety disorder, insomnia, and two normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Regular medications included lorazepam as needed for sleep; postoperative medications included tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone as needed for pain. There were no known adverse reactions to medication. The patient had attended college and worked in an office. She lived with her husband and children. She drank alcohol intermittently and did not use tobacco or other substances. There was no family history of cardiopulmonary or neurologic disorders.
The temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg while the patient was receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 8 μg per minute. The height was 168 cm and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.8. The oxygen saturation was 99% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in volume-control mode (tidal volume, 320 ml; positive end-expiratory pressure, 12 cm of water; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0). The pupils were 2 mm and symmetrically reactive. The lung sounds were coarse. The abdominal incision was well approximated and without drainage; abdominal drains were in place on both sides. A neurologic examination with interruption of sedation showed spontaneous eye-opening but an inability to visually track and to follow commands. Brain-stem reflexes were intact. The legs withdrew equally and briskly in response to pain. The remainder of the examination was normal.
A chest radiograph showed diffuse opacities in both lungs. Levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, creatine kinase, lipase, and ammonia were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Urine toxicologic screening was negative except for the presence of opiates. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram including posterior leads showed sinus rhythm, rightward axis deviation, diminutive Q waves, and minor nonspecific ST–T-wave abnormalities. An abdominal radiograph showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern, subcutaneous emphysema, and surgical drains over the pelvis. On bedside cardiac ultrasonography, the left ventricle could not be visualized clearly, but right ventricular dilatation did not appear to be present. Intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered.
Dr. Mendoza: CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed hypodensities in the left basal ganglia and right cerebellum that were suggestive of infarcts; the previously described cerebral edema had reduced slightly. A CT angiogram of the head and neck was normal. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a reduction in ground-glass opacities but an increase in consolidations, particularly in the lower lobes. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a small anterior abdominal hematoma and diffuse subcutaneous emphysema.
Dr. Shah: A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. On hospital day 2, the findings on neurologic examination worsened, with only sluggish eye-opening and no motor responses to noxious stimuli. Intravenous mannitol at a dose of 1 g per kilogram of body weight was administered.
Dr. Mendoza: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a hypodensity in the left globus pallidus that had not changed from the previous study, as well as a hypodensity in the right cerebellum that was not definitive and was probably an artifact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed infarcts within the globi pallidi and smaller punctate infarcts in the cerebral white matter. There were also innumerable diffuse microhemorrhagic foci affecting the cerebral white matter, including the corpus callosum (Figure 2).

MRI of the Head.
Dr. Shah: Bronchoscopy revealed bloody mucus in the distal trachea (Figure 3). Serial bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed in the right upper lobe revealed increasingly erythematous effluent.
FIGURE 3

Images Obtained on Bronchoscopy.
Lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were not detected. Levels of C3 and C4 were normal. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Tests for legionella, streptococcus, and galactomannan urinary antigens and antitreponemal antibodies were negative, as was a repeat nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2.
Dr. Yasmin Aghajan: On hospital day 3, the patient underwent continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. The study was abnormal because of generalized rhythmic delta activity at a frequency of 1 Hz, which occasionally evolved to generalized periodic discharges superimposed on a disorganized background with irregular delta and theta slowing. There were no epileptiform abnormalities. Although generalized rhythmic delta activity and generalized periodic discharges are on the ictal–interictal continuum, there were no features suggestive of seizures. The electroencephalographic findings were consistent with encephalopathy and the effects of propofol.
A diagnosis was made.",Fat embolism syndrome.
"Case 38-2021: A 76-Year-Old Woman with Abdominal Pain, Weight Loss, and Memory Impairment","Dr. Gabrielle K. Bromberg: A 76-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain, anorexia, weight loss, memory impairment, and suicidal ideation.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 months before this admission, when she began having epigastric pain and anorexia associated with new constipation. Findings on upper and lower endoscopy were reportedly normal, as were the results of serologic testing for celiac disease.
Fifteen days before this admission, the abdominal pain worsened. Ten days before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital because of diffuse abdominal pain associated with nausea and poor oral intake. On examination, the patient appeared pale. The abdomen was soft and nontender. The patient was alert and oriented to time, place, and person but had difficulty with word finding. Initial laboratory test results were notable for normocytic anemia and an elevated bilirubin level; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Ryan Chung: On admission to the other hospital, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1A and 1B) was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. There was evidence of a previous cholecystectomy, the common bile duct measured 7 mm in diameter (reference range, <10 mm after cholecystectomy), and there was mild anasarca with diffuse mesenteric edema. On magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (Figure 1C and 1D), the common bile duct again measured 7 mm in diameter; findings were otherwise normal.
FIGURE 1

Initial Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Pelvis, Other Hospital.
Dr. Bromberg: After admission to the other hospital, 1 unit of packed red cells was transfused, and the hemoglobin level remained stable thereafter. On the third hospital day, the patient could eat small amounts of food. On further questioning, the patient expressed suicidal ideation and reported a history of prolonged domestic abuse; she was evaluated by the psychiatry service. A diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder was made, and lorazepam was administered. The suicidal ideation resolved, but she was noted to need substantial assistance with self-care. While plans were being made for the patient’s discharge to an assisted-living facility, the constipation worsened, and her oral intake decreased. On the seventh hospital day, vomiting developed, and the laboratory evaluation was notable for hyponatremia, with a blood sodium level of 120 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). A nasogastric tube was placed, and 3% hypertonic saline was administered intravenously. On the eighth day at the other hospital, additional imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Chung: Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1E and 1F), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple dilated, fluid-filled loops of small bowel that measured up to 4 cm in diameter and the presence of air–fluid levels and an abrupt transition point in the right lower quadrant.
Dr. Bromberg: Urine specimens had been sent for measurement of urinary porphyrin levels at the time of admission to the other hospital; the resulting levels were elevated (Table 1), and the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation.
On admission to this hospital, the patient reported persistent abdominal pain, constipation, and anorexia. The vomiting had resolved after insertion of the nasogastric tube. She reported weight loss of 18 kg over the course of the previous 4 months while she was following a limited diet. In an effort to improve the patient’s overall health, the patient’s daughter had provided her with supplements and recommended a ketogenic diet consisting of protein and cooked vegetables. The patient also reported that she had been having difficulty with memory for 2 months before this admission.
The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glaucoma. Her surgical history included remote cholecystectomy and hysterectomy. Medications included pantoprazole, ondansetron, and calcium carbonate in combination with cholecalciferol. The patient was allergic to ampicillin, penicillin, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, tetracycline, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, and nortriptyline — all with unknown reactions. She lived with her sister in suburban New England and reported that she was recently separated from her husband owing to long-standing domestic abuse. The patient had two children. She did not have contact with her son, and her daughter lived in India but visited regularly. Her mother had died from breast cancer. Her father and son both had bipolar affective disorder. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.
On examination, the temperature was 36.1°C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.5. The patient appeared cachectic. There was a nasogastric tube in place. The conjunctivae were pale. The abdomen was soft and diffusely tender, without guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness. There was no rash. The patient was alert but inconsistently oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was tangential, and she was unable to recite days of the week backward. The remainder of the examination was normal.
The hemoglobin level was 9.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A peripheral-blood smear showed normochromic red cells with occasional burr cells and no schistocytes. Reticulocytes, basophilic stippling, and rare nucleated red cells were present; there were no blasts, and the white cells were morphologically normal.
Dr. Chung: Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant revealed mildly increased echogenicity and mild coarsening of the liver parenchyma (Figure 2). The common bile duct measured 5 mm in diameter.
FIGURE 2

Additional Imaging Studies of the Abdomen, This Hospital.
Dr. Bromberg: Intravenous fluids and hemin were administered. On the third hospital day, the volume of output from the nasogastric tube remained elevated. The patient underwent surgical exploration for possible small-bowel obstruction. Dilated loops of small bowel with a transition point near the terminal ileum were observed; there was a loop of small bowel tethered underneath an adhesion band around which the cecum had volvulized. The adhesion was lysed, and the loop of small bowel released. There was no mass or stricture.
A diagnosis was made.",Lead poisoning.
"Case 37-2021: A 60-Year-Old Man with Fevers, Fatigue, Arthralgias, a Mouth Ulcer, and a Rash","Dr. Zoe N. Memel (Medicine): A 60-year-old man presented to this hospital because of fevers, fatigue, arthralgias, a mouth ulcer, and a rash.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 month before the current presentation, when sore throat, fever, and fatigue developed while he was visiting relatives in the Southwest region of the United States. The symptoms persisted despite regular use of acetaminophen. Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a local hospital in the Southwest, where a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reportedly negative. Oral amoxicillin–clavulanic acid and doxycycline were prescribed, and the patient was discharged home.
Ten days before the current presentation, a tongue ulcer developed, along with dry scaly nodules on the face and hands and migratory arthralgias in the wrists, fingers, elbows, and shoulders. Because of worsening symptoms, the patient returned home to Boston by airplane. When he landed in Boston, the patient felt too weak to stand, and an ambulance was called to transport him to this hospital.
In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing fevers, fatigue, arthralgias, and sore throat. He had lost 4.5 kg over a 1-month period. He had no eye redness or pain, genital ulcers, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or headache. There was no notable medical history, and the patient had not been taking any regular medications before this illness. He had completed a course of oral amoxicillin–clavulanic acid and doxycycline the day before presentation, and he had been taking acetaminophen for the past month. There were no known drug allergies.
The patient was born in China and had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier. He lived with his wife in Boston. He had not traveled internationally for more than 10 years. The patient had previously worked in environmental maintenance but was retired. He had no history of exposure to animals or fresh water and no sick contacts. He had not been sexually active for several years. He was a smoker with a 30-pack-year history, and he drank alcohol socially; there was no injection-drug use. His family history included colon cancer in his father, lung cancer in his mother, pancreatic cancer in his sister, and hepatocellular carcinoma in his brother.
On examination, the temperature was 37.8°C, the blood pressure 118/69 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 59 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 19.2. The patient appeared unwell. There was no conjunctival injection. Oral mucous membranes were dry. There was a circular shallow ulcer on the lateral aspect of the tongue on the left side, as well as white plaque on the dorsal aspect of the tongue. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly. Strength was 4/5 in both shoulders. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. There were several small scaly nodules with a rim of patchy erythema on the fingers, an erosion with serosanguineous crust on the left elbow, and two erythematous and mildly violaceous nodules on the forehead (Figure 1). There were no genital lesions.

Dr. Karen Rodriguez: Chest radiography performed in the emergency department revealed bibasilar patchy opacities. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dependent reticular opacities throughout the lower lobes of the lungs (Figure 2). CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a left adrenal nodule, measuring 1.2 cm in diameter.
FIGURE 2

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Memel: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Intravenous fluid and oral fluconazole were administered. Biopsies of skin lesions on the left elbow and left side of the forehead were performed. During the next 5 days, the fatigue, arthralgias, skin lesions, and mouth pain continued, and daily fevers with temperatures of up to 38.8°C were recorded. The mouth lesion did not abate with the use of fluconazole, which was being administered for presumptive oral candidiasis, and the agent was discontinued.
Dr. Samantha N. Champion: Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen of the forehead lesion revealed vacuolar interface dermatitis with hyperkeratosis, dyskeratosis, pigment incontinence, and sparse perivascular chronic inflammation. Similar findings were observed on histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen of the elbow lesion.
Dr. Memel: Cough developed, and pain in the left shoulder increased. On the fifth hospital day, the creatine kinase level was 906 U per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The next day, imaging studies of the left shoulder were obtained.
Dr. Rodriguez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left shoulder, performed on hospital day 6, revealed patchy mild intramuscular edema that was most pronounced in the trapezius and deltoid, a finding compatible with myositis (Figure 2). There was no focal or organized fluid collection.
Dr. Memel: On hospital day 10, biopsy of the left deltoid was performed with the patient under general anesthesia. In the 24 hours after the muscle biopsy, hypoxemia developed, and the patient received 3 liters of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of more than 93%. The next day, the patient received 8 liters of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies of the chest were obtained.
Dr. Rodriguez: Repeat chest radiography revealed progressive patchy opacities at the lung bases. Repeat CT of the chest revealed progressive peribronchovascular and peripheral ground-glass and consolidative opacities predominantly involving the lower lobes, a finding consistent with organizing pneumonia (Figure 2). In addition, new small left and trace right pleural effusions were present.
Dr. Memel: A diagnostic test was performed.",Anti–melanoma differentiation–associated protein 5 (anti–MDA-5) dermatomyositis.
Case 36-2021: A 22-Year-Old Man with Pain and Erythema of the Left Hand,"Dr. Marisa L. Winkler: A 22-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of pain and rapidly spreading erythema of the left hand.
The patient had been well until the day of admission, when he awoke with pain and swelling of the left hand that involved the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger. Over a period of several hours, the pain progressed and bullae began to form. He began to have pain with movement of the second and fourth fingers, and the bullae turned dark purple; these changes prompted the patient to present to the emergency department of this hospital.
In the emergency department, the patient reported pain of the left hand that worsened with movement of the second and fourth fingers. There was no lethargy, fatigue, headache, dyspnea, cough, or pain elsewhere. The patient had no notable medical history and had been well before the day of presentation.
On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 38.6°C, the blood pressure 126/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There were two violaceous, tender bullae on the dorsal aspect of the left hand — one on the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and one on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger, each measuring 7 mm by 3 mm (Figure 1). In addition, there was nontender, streaking erythema spreading across the dorsal aspect of the left hand, the volar aspect of the left forearm, and the medial aspect of the left upper arm into the axilla. There was no axillary lymphadenopathy.
FIGURE 1

Clinical Photographs.
On further examination of the left arm, the soft-tissue compartments were soft and compressible, without evidence of crepitus. Finger flexion and extension were intact but limited by pain and swelling in the second and fourth fingers. Results of motor and sensory examinations were normal. The hand was warm. The radial pulse was palpable, and the capillary refill was brisk. The remainder of the overall physical examination was unremarkable. A blood specimen was obtained for culture, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. Initial laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Winkler: While the patient was in the emergency department, additional history was obtained. The patient was not taking any medications and had no known allergies to medications. He had recently graduated from college and was seeking employment. He lived with his parents in a suburban area of New England. There was no history of recent travel or sick contacts. He rarely drank alcohol and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. There was no notable family history.
The patient had recently begun practicing taxidermy as a new hobby. Four days before presentation, he received a frozen deer hide from a friend, which he began to prepare for tanning. When he first received the deer hide, he scraped the skin and fur to remove numerous ticks. On the day before presentation, he kneaded the hide with his hands and massaged into it a mixture of deer brain and tap water that had been prepared the day before and left to stand overnight. While the patient was working with the animal hide, he did not wear protective clothing or gloves. His mother had assisted in part of the process but remained well.
Intravenous fluid, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Consultants from the orthopedic hand service, dermatology, and infectious diseases evaluated the patient. A diagnostic test was performed.",Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae infection.
Case 35-2021: A 50-Year-Old Woman with Pain in the Left Upper Quadrant and Hypoxemia,"Dr. Mubeen A. Shakir (Medicine): A 50-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of pain in the left upper quadrant and hypoxemia.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 year before this admission, when fatigue and weight loss developed and she had abnormal results on liver-function tests after undergoing cholecystectomy for presumed acalculous cholecystitis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, which was performed as part of the evaluation to determine the cause of the abnormal liver-function test results, revealed hepatosplenomegaly (Figure 1A).
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies Obtained before Admission.
Seven months before this admission, a submandibular mass and swelling developed; 1 month later, examination of a biopsy specimen of the mass revealed granulomatous sialadenitis. A liver biopsy was performed to investigate the patient’s abdominal distention, poor appetite, and persistently abnormal liver-function test results, which were suggestive of cholestasis. The liver-biopsy specimen showed evidence of granulomatous hepatitis; portal and periportal nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation that was associated with multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, and some plasma cells; and stage 1 to 2 (portal and periportal) fibrosis. Special stains for organisms (acid-fast and Grocott methenamine–silver stains) were negative.
CT of the chest revealed minimal bibasilar atelectasis and a trace left pleural effusion. An interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Tests for histoplasma species, blastomyces species, cryptococcus species, coccidioides species, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses were all negative, as was testing for antinuclear antibodies, antimitochondrial antibodies, and anti–smooth muscle antibodies. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made on the basis of the biopsy results of the submandibular gland and liver and the presence of hypercalcemia and an elevated angiotensin-converting–enzyme level.
Four months before this admission, prednisone therapy was initiated at a dose of 40 mg per day; subsequently, there was a marked reduction in the patient’s abdominal distention and marked improvement in her appetite. Liver-function test results also improved. Methotrexate therapy was started at a dose of 15 mg per week, with plans to taper the dose of prednisone.
Three months before this admission, the patient stopped prednisone therapy because of irritability and insomnia. One month later, routine monitoring of the patient’s liver function revealed worsening liver-function test results in a cholestatic pattern. This finding was attributed to undertreatment of sarcoidosis, but the patient declined to restart prednisone; the dose of methotrexate was increased to 25 mg per week.
During the next month, the patient noted fatigue, slowly progressive dyspnea on exertion, and cough, without fever or chills. She was evaluated by her primary care physician 1 month before this admission, and a chest radiograph showed bilateral, perihilar, diffuse, symmetric ground-glass opacities with scattered patchy opacities at the lung bases (Figure 1B and 1C). Levofloxacin was administered.
Three weeks before this admission, CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed worsening hepatosplenomegaly. Prednisone therapy was started at a dose of 20 mg per day.
On the morning of admission, the patient was awakened from sleep by severe, sharp pain in the left upper quadrant. The pain was not worse with eating, and she reported no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Because of persistent pain throughout the day, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported progressive dyspnea on exertion and being unable to climb stairs in her home. There was no chest pain, edema in the legs, weight gain, or orthopnea. She had a cough that was productive of clear sputum but had no fevers or chills.
The patient had a history of preeclampsia, Helicobacter pylori infection, cholecystectomy, and papillary thyroid cancer for which she had undergone hemithyroidectomy 9 years before this admission. In addition to methotrexate and prednisone, her medications included omeprazole and trazodone. Her father had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and one son had ulcerative colitis. Both maternal grandparents had had tuberculosis, but the patient had not had contact with them; her mother had latent tuberculosis. The patient had no known drug allergies. She worked as an administrative assistant and lived with her husband and children in a suburb of Boston. She had never smoked tobacco, did not use illicit drugs, and previously drank one glass of wine per week before her diagnosis of sarcoidosis. She had not traveled outside the United States in the past 5 years.
On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 112/56 mm Hg, the pulse 128 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21. The patient was awake and alert but appeared fatigued. The first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) were normal, without murmurs; the jugular venous pressure, which was measured from the approximate midpoint of the right atrium, was 6 cm of water. Crackles were present in the middle and lower lung fields bilaterally. Normal bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft and nondistended, with tenderness in the left upper quadrant. The liver edge was palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin; the spleen tip was also palpable. There was no edema in the legs. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 93%.
The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The level of alanine aminotransferase was 38 IU per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin were normal. The blood level of alkaline phosphatase was 268 IU per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila antigens were not detected in the urine. The blood level of 1,3-β-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Victorine V. Muse: CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hepatosplenomegaly with a hypodense wedge-shaped region in the midpole of the spleen. A portable anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure 2C) showed progressive coalescing consolidations in the middle and lower lobes with diffuse ground-glass opacities. CT of the chest (Figure 2D), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy and confirmed the presence of multifocal confluent areas of airspace consolidation, with a background of diffuse ground-glass opacities. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism or pleural effusions.

Imaging Studies Obtained on Admission.
Dr. Shakir: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with prednisone, methotrexate, and omeprazole was stopped, and trazodone was continued. On hospital day 2, the temperature rose to 39.1°C, the respiratory rate increased to 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. Supplemental oxygen was increased to a rate of 5 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 93%. Cultures of the blood were obtained.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.
Case 34-2021: A 38-Year-Old Man with Altered Mental Status and New Onset of Seizures,"Dr. Luke A. Stevens (Emergency Medicine): A 38-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of altered mental status and a seizure.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until the night before the current evaluation. His wife reported that he fell out of bed at approximately 4 a.m. and was on the floor “shaking.” He appeared confused and was “speaking gibberish.” Police were called to the patient’s apartment, and emergency medical services were activated. On evaluation at the patient’s home, a fingerstick blood glucose measurement was 110 mg per deciliter (6.1 mmol per liter). The patient was combative and disoriented, and he actively resisted being placed in the ambulance. On arrival at the emergency department, he had a witnessed generalized tonic–clonic seizure, lasting 2 minutes, for which lorazepam was administered intravenously.
A limited history was obtained from the patient’s wife, brother, and sister-in-law. The patient had not been ill recently and had no history of seizures or cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or neurologic disorders. His medical history was notable for a laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient took no medications and had no known adverse reactions to medications. He worked in environmental maintenance at a local business. He lived with his wife, daughter, and son. He had immigrated to Boston from a rural area of Guatemala approximately 20 years earlier. He rarely drank alcohol and did not use tobacco or illicit drugs. There was no known family history of seizure disorder or other neurologic disease.
The temperature was 36.4°C, the heart rate 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 171/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was using a nonrebreather mask. His eyes were open, and an involuntary upward gaze was noted; the pupils were 4 mm, symmetric, and reactive to light. He did not verbally respond to questions or follow commands. Gag and cough reflexes were normal. He withdrew his arms and legs in response to pain, and a jerking motion of the head was noted. The score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 6 (on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating greater alteration of consciousness). The neck was supple. Peripheral reflexes were normal. The toes were downgoing bilaterally. Scant blood was observed in the mouth, without visible lacerations. The remainder of the examination was normal.
Blood levels of albumin, globulin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, lipase, N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin T were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A blood specimen was obtained to test for strongyloides antibodies. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 114 beats per minute but was otherwise normal.

Seven minutes after the first dose, a second dose of lorazepam was administered intravenously for suspected continued seizure activity. The patient remained confused and agitated, and an endotracheal tube was placed for airway protection. A chest radiograph was normal, with the endotracheal tube in an appropriate position.
A diagnosis was made.",Seizure from neurocysticercosis.
Case 33-2021: A 68-Year-Old Man with Painful Mouth Ulcers,"Dr. Ian D. Cooley (Medicine): A 68-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of painful mouth ulcers and weight loss.
The patient had been well until 6 weeks before the current admission, when painful mouth ulcers and neck pain developed. He was evaluated at an urgent care center. He had reduced range of motion of the neck due to pain with flexion, extension, and rotation, but there was no spinal tenderness. There were small ulcers on the lower lip and gingivae. Cyclobenzaprine and acyclovir were prescribed.
Five weeks before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician in a clinic at this hospital. He reported that neck pain on the right side and oral ulcers had persisted and that several new oral ulcers had developed. He had no rash, eye pain, joint pain or swelling, dysuria or genital lesions, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. The examination was notable for several large ulcers on the lips and tongue (Figure 1A). Treatment with acyclovir was continued. A direct immunofluorescence assay of a swab of an oral ulcer was negative for herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 and for varicella–zoster virus. Blood tests were negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 and for syphilis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was referred to the dermatology clinic for further evaluation of the oral ulcers.

Before the patient could be evaluated in the dermatology clinic, his mouth ulcers and pain worsened. Four weeks before the current admission, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital. Erythema and watering of the left eye had developed, as had new skin lesions on the trunk and upper face. The examination revealed multiple ulcers on the lips and tongue (Figure 1B) and two pink crusted papules with hemorrhage on the right temple. There were scattered pustules on the lower back and right flank. An ophthalmologic examination revealed a pinguecula on the nasal side of the right eye with mild surrounding inflammation but was otherwise normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney- and liver-function tests. HLA typing was positive for the HLA-B51 allele; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology and dermatology services. The decision was made to pursue a skin biopsy before an oral biopsy. A biopsy of a pustule on the patient’s back was performed, and examination of the specimen revealed mild spongiosis, neutrophilic granulomatous inflammation, and a superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils and occasional eosinophils. Colchicine was prescribed, along with oxycodone and lidocaine oral solution, for the treatment of a working diagnosis of Behçet’s disease. Outpatient follow-up with the rheumatology service was arranged.
Three days after discharge from the emergency department, the patient reported that the oral ulcers had not abated. Treatment with prednisone was started, and colchicine was continued.
Two weeks before the current admission, the patient was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. Prednisone treatment had led to only transient healing of the oral ulcers. The patient had pain with eating and speaking and had lost 10 kg of body weight in 3 weeks. The neck pain, the eye watering, and several skin lesions had resolved. The examination revealed extensive ulceration of the upper and lower labial mucosa and of the ventrolateral surface of the tongue on both sides, as well as two focal ulcerations, measuring 0.5 cm in diameter, involving the soft palate on the left side (Figure 1C and 1D). There were multiple purple-red, scaly papules involving the skin of the arms and lower legs. There was no evidence of a joint abnormality. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Prednisone was switched to oral methylprednisolone, and treatment with amoxicillin–clavulanate was started for possible bowel-associated dermatosis–arthritis syndrome. Omeprazole, which the patient had taken for many years, was stopped because of peripheral eosinophilia. An evaluation in the oral medicine clinic at an affiliated hospital was arranged, with plans for oral and skin biopsies.
One week before the current admission, a biopsy of lower labial mucosa revealed squamous mucosa and parenchyma of the minor salivary glands, with mild nonspecific chronic inflammation. A skin biopsy was notable for epidermal ulceration with impetiginization and associated folliculitis. Dexamethasone oral rinses were prescribed, as was trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci infection.
During the next 7 days, the ulcers worsened and the patient had ongoing pain that was unresponsive to oxycodone. He was unable to eat and was admitted to this hospital for pain control and further evaluation.
The patient’s medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included methylprednisolone, colchicine, amoxicillin–clavulanate, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, lorazepam, and oxycodone, as well as dexamethasone oral rinses. The patient was allergic to clarithromycin, which had caused a rash. He had quit smoking 30 years earlier, and he consumed 10 alcoholic drinks per week. There was no illicit drug use. The patient lived with his wife in a suburban area of New England. He had traveled to Western Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean. He was employed part-time as a contractor. His family history included prostate cancer in his father and type 2 diabetes mellitus in his mother.
On examination, the temperature was 35.8°C, the blood pressure 134/56 mm Hg, the heart rate 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.4. The patient looked uncomfortable, with an edematous tongue and multiple oral ulcers. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy or joint abnormality. Skin examination revealed a slightly raised pustule, measuring 2 mm in diameter, on the anterior aspect of the thigh. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Markus Y. Wu: Computed tomography (CT) of chest and abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed subtle centrilobular ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of the lungs, as well as prominent right hilar and left supraclavicular lymph nodes, each measuring 1 cm in diameter (Figure 2).

Dr. Cooley: A diagnostic procedure was performed.",Eosinophilic leukemia.
Case 32-2021: A 14-Year-Old Girl with Swelling of the Jaw and Hypercalcemia,"Dr. Austin Be (Surgery): A 14-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of swelling of the left jaw.
The patient had been well until 6 weeks before this admission, when she noticed a lump in the left lower jaw; there was no pain, tenderness, or discomfort in the jaw. She was evaluated in a primary care clinic of another hospital and was told that a salivary gland may be obstructed. Treatment with sialagogues, increased oral hydration, warm compresses, and massage of the salivary glands were recommended. During the next 3 weeks, the lump in the left jaw increased in size, and swelling of the left side of the face and neck developed. Three weeks before this admission, she returned to the primary care clinic; treatment with cephalexin was started.
Eighteen days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the otolaryngology clinic of the other hospital. The temperature was 37.2°C, the blood pressure 132/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 86 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.0. There was swelling in the left mandibular and submandibular areas, with no erythema, fluctuance, or palpable salivary stones.
Dr. Hillary R. Kelly: Computed tomography (CT) of the face and neck was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the face (Figure 1) revealed a 3.7-cm mass in the left mandibular body, with lytic and expansile features and numerous internal wavy septations. Areas of marked thinning and obliteration were noted in the buccal and lingual cortexes of the mandible, and extension of the mass among the roots of the first molar, second molar, and premolar was observed. No fluid–fluid or blood–fluid levels were seen within the lesion. There was no lymphadenopathy. The patient was referred to the otolaryngology clinic at this hospital.
FIGURE 1

CT Images of the Face.
Dr. Be: Fifteen days before this admission, the patient reported numbness and tingling in the lower lip and chin on the left side. She had had no fatigue, fever, chills, or redness and no pain in her face, jaw, or neck. On examination, she appeared well but had obvious facial asymmetry with swelling of the left mandible (Figure 2). There was a firm, mildly tender mass in the body of the left mandible that extended to the mandibular angle. Orthodontic braces were in place and dentition and jaw occlusion were normal. The remainder of the ear, nose, and throat examination was normal. The overlying skin was normal, and no anterior or posterior submandibular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was present. The blood levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride were normal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of coagulation and renal function. The calcium level was 11.8 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), and the albumin level was 4.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.3 to 5.0). Radiography of the chest was normal.
FIGURE 2

Clinical Photographs before Excision of the Lesion.
Dr. Vania Nosé: An intraoral biopsy of the left mandibular mass was performed. Pathological examination (Figure 3C) of the biopsy specimen revealed that the lesion was partially surrounded by reactive bone trabeculae, was hemorrhagic, and contained numerous osteoclast-type giant cells around extravasated red cells, findings that were consistent with a central giant-cell lesion or a central giant-cell granuloma.
FIGURE 3

Surgical Approach and Biopsy and Surgical Specimens.
Dr. Be: Ten days before this admission, the patient was seen in the oral and maxillofacial surgical clinic of this hospital, and admission for the excision of the left mandibular mass was planned.
On admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had normal growth and development and had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had finished the prescribed course of cephalexin and had taken no other medications; penicillin had caused fever and hives early in childhood. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her mother, stepfather, and two cats; she frequently stayed in another suburban area of New England with her father. The patient performed well in high school and participated in theater. She did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. Her mother had hypothyroidism; her father had obstructive sleep apnea. Her maternal grandmother had a history of hypothyroidism, parathyroid adenoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer; her paternal grandfather had died from colon cancer.
The temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 128/85 mm Hg, and the heart rate 111 beats per minute. The physical examination was unchanged. The left mandibular mass was excised. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed abundant giant cells.
On the second hospital day, the calcium level was 12.6 mg per deciliter (3.2 mmol per liter) and the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 396 pg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 60).
A diagnosis was made.",Primary hyperparathyroidism and brown tumor.
"Case 31-2021: A 21-Year-Old Man with Sore Throat, Epistaxis, and Oropharyngeal Petechiae","Dr. Philippe-Antoine Bilodeau (Medicine): A 21-year-old man presented to this hospital with a sore throat, epistaxis, and petechiae of the oropharynx.
One week before the current presentation, blood-filled blisters developed inside the patient’s mouth, on the buccal mucosa. He had occasional bleeding from the mouth that resolved spontaneously. He consulted with his dentist, who was concerned about the possibility of impacted wisdom teeth. Two days before the current presentation, a sore throat developed. There was no difficulty with swallowing. On the day of the current presentation, epistaxis developed and did not resolve over a period of 2 hours.
The patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.1°C, the blood pressure 142/76 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. He had blood in the nares and petechiae on the soft palate. There was a large ecchymosis on the left forearm that the patient attributed to carrying heavy boxes several days earlier. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), a platelet count of 1000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000), and a white-cell count of 670 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). The absolute neutrophil count was 50 per microliter (reference range, 1800 to 7000). Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of tests for coagulation, renal function, and liver function. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The nose was packed to control the bleeding, and 1 unit of platelets was transfused. The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional evaluation and treatment.

In the emergency department of this hospital, the patient reported a mild sore throat but no other symptoms; epistaxis had resolved with nasal packing. There was no fever, weight loss, rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The patient had a history of sickle cell trait. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He had been living with his parents and younger brother since he had left his college campus at the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. He worked in a grocery store, and his only known sick contact was his mother, who had been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2 months earlier. She had been isolated in a room in their home during her illness. The patient did not have any symptoms associated with Covid-19 and had never been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. His father and brother had been well. The family lived adjacent to a wooded region, and the patient had been hiking in northern New England 2 months before the current presentation. He had not noticed any tick bites. He had no animal contacts. The patient was born in Central America and had moved to a suburban region of New England at 3 years of age. He had previously traveled to Mexico and Canada. He was sexually active with female partners only. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and paternal family members had sickle cell disease.
On examination, the patient appeared well. There were petechiae on the soft palate (Figure 1). There was no scleral icterus, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly. A large ecchymosis was present on the left forearm. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of folate and cobalamin were normal, as were results of serum protein electrophoresis and the ratio of free kappa to lambda light chains. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A radiograph of the chest and an ultrasound image of the upper abdomen were normal, without splenomegaly. Testing of a specimen obtained from the nasopharynx was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA; the patient was admitted to the hospital and placed in enhanced isolation. Examination of thick and thin peripheral-blood smears for babesia was negative.

Case 30-2021: A 47-Year-Old Man with Recurrent Unilateral Head and Neck Pain,"Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 47-year-old right-handed man was evaluated at this hospital because of pain on the left side of the head and neck.
Six years before the current evaluation, the patient was admitted to this hospital with 1 week of headache, pain on the left side of the neck, numbness on the left side of the face, and dizziness. The pain was not relieved with the use of ibuprofen and had previously been evaluated and treated by a chiropractor. A neurologic examination revealed a slight decrease in taste and in sensation to touch and temperature on the left side of the face; a gait evaluation revealed a subtle leftward sway. Imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Byung C. Yoon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed subtle foci of hypodensity in the left cerebellum, a finding suggestive of infarction. There was no evidence of arterial dissection, aneurysm, stenosis, or thrombotic occlusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, confirmed the presence of a left medial cerebellar infarct and a small left lateral medullary infarct (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C).
FIGURE 1

MRI and CT Angiogram.
Dr. Dudzinski: The patient had normal results on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, echocardiography, and a hypercoagulability panel, except for a mildly elevated level of anticardiolipin IgM (18.9 IgM phospholipid units; reference range, 0 to 15). During the hospital admission, lesions with a vesicular appearance developed on the left side of the lips and oral cavity, and the patient was treated with famciclovir. He was discharged home while receiving aspirin, with a follow-up visit scheduled in the neurology clinic.
One month later in the neurology clinic, the patient reported partial resolution of headache, persistent neck pain and ear pain with balance difficulty, and perioral paresthesia. There was diminished sensation on the left side of the face (similar to that observed during the previous examination). No oropharyngeal lesions were visible. An evaluation of gait and balance was normal.
Dr. Yoon: Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed expected evolution of the left cerebellar infarct and no new infarction. The left posterior inferior cerebellar artery was not visualized, possibly because of occlusion or slow blood flow.
Dr. Dudzinski: Repeat CSF analysis showed normal protein and glucose levels and 14 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 94% were lymphocytes. Gram’s staining showed no organisms. CSF tests for borrelia and varicella DNA and for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus antibodies were negative. Two days later, cerebral angiography revealed mild narrowing of the origin of the left vertebral artery. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-La and anti-Ro antibodies were negative, as was a rapid plasma reagin test.
The patient received follow-up care at another hospital until the current evaluation, when he presented to the emergency department of this hospital with 3 days of severe pain on exertion that affected the left side of the neck and left temporo-occipital region. The symptoms were similar to those he had reported in the past and were not relieved with the use of ibuprofen or marijuana. The head pain was described as pulsating and pounding, and it worsened when he was in the supine position.
The patient reported right flank pain; the onset of this pain had occurred with lifting of a heavy object and had just preceded the onset of headache. He also reported a tendency to bruise. The review of systems was otherwise normal. His medical history was notable for dyslipidemia. He had undergone repair of meniscus tears in both knees and repair of a traumatic dislocation of the right shoulder. Medications included rosuvastatin and gemfibrozil, as well as acetaminophen as needed. There were no known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was a self-employed laborer and lived with his wife and children in a suburb of Boston. He smoked cigars and marijuana occasionally, and he drank up to eight beers per day on weekends. His family history was notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia in both of his parents, as well as early-onset dementia in his father.
The temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 176/119 mm Hg in both arms, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A neurologic examination revealed a mild decrease in coordination in the left hand but was otherwise normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, troponin T, C-reactive protein, lipoprotein(a), and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of renal function tests. Urinalysis was also normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Yoon: CT angiography of the head and neck, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dissection of the left vertebral artery, extending from the origin of the artery to the proximal V3 (upper cervical) segment, with a 2-mm pseudoaneurysm at the C2–C3 level (Figure 1D and 1E). There was no evidence of acute ischemia. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of infarction or a perfusion abnormality. However, a T1-weighted image showed a focus of intrinsic hyperintensity along the left vertebral artery, a finding consistent with hemorrhage within the vessel wall from the dissection (Figure 1F).
Dr. Dudzinski: The patient was admitted to the neurology service. Control of the blood pressure required multiple medications. Echocardiography showed no cardiac, valvular, or aortic structural abnormality. Right flank pain recurred. Urinalysis showed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field but was otherwise normal.
Dr. Yoon: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dissection of the right renal artery, extending from the origin of the artery to subsegmental renal arteries. Perinephric fat stranding was present on the right side, and there were areas of diminished enhancement in the right kidney. These findings were suggestive of infarction (Figure 2).

Case 29-2021: A 12-Month-Old Boy with Fever and Developmental Regression,"Dr. Emma C. Materne (Pediatrics): A 12-month-old boy with Hirschsprung’s disease was admitted to this hospital because of fever.
Fifteen days before the current admission, the patient had a temperature of 39.7°C. His parents noticed that he was fussy and less active than usual and that he had a decreased appetite along with several episodes of “spitting up”; there was no vomiting or diarrhea. During the next 5 days, fever occurred daily and abated with the administration of acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Ten days before the current admission, a bowel movement with watery, nonbloody, foul-smelling, mustard-yellow stool occurred. The patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.
On examination, the patient was irritable. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There were well-circumscribed, erythematous, edematous plaques on the abdomen, legs, feet, and forearms. The alanine aminotransferase level was 131 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the aspartate aminotransferase level 250 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 80), the ferritin level 3826 μg per liter (reference range, 30 to 300), and the d-dimer level 3218 ng per milliliter (reference range, <500). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 40 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 15); the white-cell count was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A radiograph of the abdomen showed gas-filled loops of bowel. The rectum was irrigated, and intravenous piperacillin–tazobactam was administered. On the third hospital day, the patient was afebrile and able to take formula, and the diarrhea abated. He was discharged home with a prescription for a course of metronidazole.

During the next 2 days, the patient had no fever or diarrhea. However, 4 days before the current admission, a day-care worker observed that the patient appeared tired. During the subsequent 3 days at home, fever again developed, with chills and a decreased appetite. The day before the current admission, the patient cried through the night. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
The parents reported that the patient was fussy and had poor sleep and generalized weakness; there was no diarrhea or new rash. The parents did not think that the patient was in pain. Additional history was obtained from the parents. The patient had met developmental milestones until 1 month earlier, when he had stopped crawling. He had previously been able to pull his body into a standing position, but he no longer attempted this maneuver. If he was placed in a standing position, he collapsed; if he was placed in a sitting position, he was able to stay upright. He had previously passed objects from hand to hand, but he had a new preference of holding objects with the left hand. Two days before this evaluation, the parents had noticed that the patient no longer walked with support; he seemed to dislike having his hands held.
The patient had cornea plana and a history of Hirschsprung’s disease, for which he had undergone laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and an anal pull-through procedure at 2 months of age. Four months before the current evaluation, an intermittent diffuse rash on the trunk, arms, and legs had developed. The rash was characterized by purplish and pinkish plaques that appeared and varied in intensity of color throughout the day; it did not seem to be itchy or painful and usually resolved within 24 hours without treatment.
Immunizations were up to date. Medications included metronidazole, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and cetirizine, as well as carboxymethylcellulose eye drops; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient lived with his mother, father, and pet dog in a small town in New England, and he attended day care 5 days per week. His mother was healthy, and his father had irritable bowel syndrome and Poland syndrome (congenital aplasia of unilateral chest-wall muscles). His paternal grandmother had hypothyroidism, his maternal great-grandfather had had pancreatic cancer, his paternal great-grandfather had had breast cancer, a maternal second cousin had autism, and multiple maternal family members had Raynaud’s phenomenon.
On examination, the temperature was 38.3°C, the blood pressure 113/52 mm Hg, the heart rate 166 beats per minute (normal range for age, 80 to 160), and the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute (normal range for age, 30 to 60). The patient was diaphoretic and irritable, and he cried during the examination. He had rhinorrhea. The abdomen was not distended or tender. There was limited extension of the wrists and knees, as well as limited inversion and eversion of the feet. The ankles were mildly stiff, and the feet were mildly swollen. There were erythematous plaques on the abdomen, back, arms, and legs (Figure 1).
FIGURE 1

Clinical Photographs.
The ferritin and d-dimer levels remained elevated, and the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 75 mm per hour, the white-cell count 26,820 per microliter (reference range, 6000 to 17,500), and the platelet count 682,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood cultures and urinalysis were normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Randheer Shailam: A radiograph of the chest and abdomen was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed cholelithiasis and prominent lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed a small amount of joint fluid in the hips and knees (Figure 2); the amount of fluid appeared to be within the normal range. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder, without gallbladder distention. There were a few prominent lymph nodes in the paraaortic, iliac, and inguinal regions (Figure 2). Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal coronary arteries.
FIGURE 2

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Materne: The empirical administration of intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was begun. During the next 3 days, the fever continued and the white-cell count remained elevated. On the seventh hospital day, the fever, leukocytosis, and elevation in levels of inflammatory markers persisted. The administration of antibiotic agents was stopped.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Case 28-2021: A 37-Year-Old Woman with Covid-19 and Suicidal Ideation,"Dr. Reuben A. Hendler (Psychiatry): A 37-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of fever, shortness of breath, and suicidal ideation in March 2020, during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
Ten days before this admission, fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias developed. The symptoms did not abate after the patient took aspirin and acetaminophen. Five days before this admission, she sought evaluation at the urgent care clinic of this hospital because Covid-19 had been diagnosed in two coworkers. A test for Covid-19 was not performed because of limited test availability; tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were not performed because of a statewide shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs. The patient was instructed to quarantine at home.
During the next 5 days, the patient quarantined in a room in her apartment. Her husband periodically brought food to the door of the room. The fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias persisted; new shortness of breath and anosmia developed. She had decreased appetite, and she consumed minimal food and drink.
One day before this admission, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, and the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and ketorolac were administered, and she was discharged home with instructions to continue to quarantine.
On the day of admission, the patient had dizziness while standing, as well as shortness of breath, and she returned to the urgent care clinic of this hospital. The temperature was 38.7°C, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 38 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was anxious and tearful. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and oral acetaminophen were administered. The dizziness resolved, and the fever, shortness of breath, and anxiety decreased. The patient was advised to return home to quarantine; however, she disclosed that if she were sent home, she planned to overdose on medications to die by suicide because of her anxiety and feelings of sadness and loneliness. Owing to concern about the patient’s risk of harming herself, an order authorizing temporary involuntary hospitalization was implemented. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was brought to the emergency department.
On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported anxiety, palpitations, and shortness of breath and noted that her anxiety and feelings of isolation and loneliness had developed during quarantine. She also reported poor sleep, decreased energy, and anhedonia. The patient described that she felt like a burden to her husband and was terrified that she would transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to her children, including her 4-year-old son, who had been born prematurely and had a congenital pulmonary condition.
In addition, the patient reported a 1-week history of new, recurring nightmares in which she would see herself playing with her own severed body parts; these nightmares occurred more frequently during periods of high fever. She intermittently had the sensation that someone was in the room with her while she was awake, even though she was aware that she was alone. She disclosed that, on the previous day, she had had new suicidal ideation associated with fear of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to her family and that she had taken five aspirin–paracetamol–caffeine pills at once. There had been no history of suicidal ideation or attempt, self-harm, or homicidal ideation.
The patient had a history of depression and panic attacks when she was a teenager and had been treated for less than 1 year with a medication that she could not recall; the symptoms had resolved by 19 years of age, and there had been no mental health follow-up. She also had a history of migraines, which occurred four times per week. She took aspirin, acetaminophen, and aspirin–paracetamol–caffeine as needed; there were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in Central America and had been living in the United States for 19 years. She lived with her husband, four children, and mother-in-law in an urban area of New England in a community that was predominantly Latinx and that had a high rate of Covid-19–related infections and deaths. The patient did not complete high school while she was living in Central America and was currently employed full time in a food-production factory. She reported that she enjoyed her job but that she had been reluctant to work during the Covid-19 pandemic because of concern about becoming ill; however, she described that she felt obligated to work to support her family. The patient did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from cancer.
On examination, the temperature was 38.2°C, the blood pressure 148/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared well-groomed and fatigued, and she was tearful with a depressed and dysphoric mood. Her behavior was described as “sullen,” and there was limited eye contact and reduced psychomotor activity. Her speech, in Spanish, was fluent but was slow and mumbling, with reduced prosody. She had no derailment of thought, delusions, or obsessions, but she ruminated on her nightmares. She stated that she had no current suicidal ideation but that she might attempt suicide if she had to return to her children and expose them to SARS-CoV-2 again.
Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the chest revealed ground-glass opacities in the right middle and lower lobes and in the left lower lobe. Intravenous ceftriaxone, oral azithromycin, atorvastatin, and hydroxychloroquine were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.

Case 27-2021: A 16-Year-Old Boy Seeking Human Immunodeficiency Virus Prophylaxis,"Dr. Elizabeth A. Perzanowski (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old boy was seen in the infectious disease clinic at this hospital for consideration of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
The patient identified as a cisgender male and reported having had more than 10 male sexual partners, many of whom he had met through online dating platforms. He had oral sex, as well as insertive and receptive anal intercourse. He used condoms intermittently. The patient had learned about HIV PrEP through websites linked to online dating platforms and expressed interest in initiation of HIV PrEP during a routine visit with his pediatrician. The patient reported that he might discuss this plan with one of his parents, but he had not yet chosen to disclose his sexual activity or his desire to initiate PrEP to either of them. He sought care at a sexual health clinic; because he was a minor seeking medication for HIV prevention rather than screening or treatment for other sexually transmitted infections, he was referred for an appointment on the same day with an internal medicine–pediatrics physician in the infectious disease clinic at this hospital for an evaluation for HIV PrEP.
The patient arrived at the clinic alone and requested that the content of the visit remain confidential. He reported feeling well, with no dysuria, penile discharge, genital lesions, or penile or testicular pain. He had a history of mild dyslexia, herpes labialis, and seasonal allergies. Two months earlier, he had been seen by his primary care physician because of intermittent rectal pain and slight hematochezia. A rectal examination performed during that visit had revealed mild irritation of the perianal skin and a healing fissure; the symptoms were attributed to constipation and resolved with the administration of polyethylene glycol and increased intake of dietary fiber. Current medications were oral penciclovir as needed and a lysine supplement. Immunizations were current, and the patient had no known allergies to medications. He was a sophomore in high school and was physically active. He lived in an urban community in New England with his parents, younger sister, and pet cats; he had two older siblings who lived independently. He reported that he did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His mother had a history of anemia, obesity, and nephrotic syndrome; a maternal aunt had leiomyosarcoma; a maternal uncle had epilepsy; and his maternal grandmother had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.
On examination, the patient was a well-appearing male adolescent. His race was recorded as Black in the electronic medical registration system. The vital signs were normal; the weight was 81.6 kg, the height 178 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.6. The mucous membranes were moist; there were no oropharyngeal exudates or ulcers. There was no rash or cervical, submandibular, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness. The penis was uncircumcised; there were no genital ulcers, fissures, or other lesions of the perianal tissue. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were results of kidney-function tests. Blood tests for hepatitis B surface antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and syphilis were negative, as were tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid performed on urine, an oropharyngeal swab, and a rectal swab. Screening tests for HIV types 1 and 2 were negative.
Management decisions were made.",Risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus infection in an adolescent.
Case 26-2021: A 49-Year-Old Man with Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"Dr. Richard A. Newcomb: A 49-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Fourteen months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated at another hospital because of pain in the right upper quadrant that had begun 4 days earlier and was associated with nausea and vomiting. Abdominal imaging revealed evidence of acute cholecystitis. Initial laboratory test results showed peripheral blasts that were suggestive of acute leukemia. The patient was transferred to a second hospital for additional evaluation. At the second hospital, abdominal imaging confirmed acute cholecystitis, and a calculus was found lodged in the neck of the gallbladder. The white-cell count was 4200 per microliter (reference range, 4200 to 9900), of which 40% were blasts. A peripheral-blood smear was notable for circulating blasts with Auer rods. The hemoglobin level was 11.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.0 to 17.4), and the platelet count was 22,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000). A bone marrow biopsy was performed, followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Dr. Andrew M. Crabbe: The bone marrow biopsy performed at the second hospital was inadequate owing to the small size of the specimen; however, intact bone marrow particles showed a cellularity of 95 to 100%. A 300-cell differential count on combined touch-imprint and aspirate smears showed 39% blasts, 3% promyelocytes, 19% neutrophils and precursors, 5% erythroid precursors, 30% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, and less than 1% basophils. The blasts were medium in size, with irregular nuclear contours, moderately clumped chromatin, occasional prominent small nucleoli, and scant granular cytoplasm. Auer rods were identified. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood identified myeloid blasts that were negative for CD34 and HLA-DR and positive for CD117, CD33, CD13, and myeloperoxidase. Cytogenetic analysis of the peripheral blood with the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a normal karyotype (46,XY) and no evidence of a t(15;17) chromosomal translocation. Molecular testing of the peripheral blood by means of dedicated polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing and next-generation sequencing identified mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, and NRAS and did not identify mutations in FLT3, IDH1, or IDH2. The overall findings of this testing were consistent with the World Health Organization classification of AML with mutated NPM1.
Dr. Newcomb: Induction chemotherapy with 7 days of cytarabine and 3 days of daunorubicin was administered. On day 34 after the initiation of chemotherapy, the absolute neutrophil count was 2.2 per microliter (reference range, 1.5 to 7.5), and the platelet count was 536,000 per microliter. A bone marrow biopsy performed on day 37 after initiation of chemotherapy revealed hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. There was no morphologic or phenotypic evidence of persistent or relapsed AML. A 300-cell sample of the bone marrow aspirate contained less than 1% blasts. Consolidation chemotherapy with four cycles of high-dose cytarabine was completed 8 months before the current presentation.
Dr. Crabbe: A bone marrow biopsy performed after the final cycle of chemotherapy revealed normocellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis; there was no morphologic or phenotypic evidence of AML. Next-generation sequencing of the bone marrow biopsy specimen revealed no pathogenic mutations.
Dr. Newcomb: The patient remained well for 7 months. One month before the current presentation, mild leukopenia developed, and more frequent laboratory monitoring was instituted. One week before the current presentation, the white-cell count was 2600 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 10,000), of which 13% were peripheral blasts. The patient was referred to this hospital for evaluation.
On presentation to this hospital, the patient reported a 3-week history of progressive fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, exercise intolerance, widespread muscle aches, and night sweats. He noted that similar symptoms had preceded his initial diagnosis.
Medical history included obesity and hypertension. The patient was not taking medications on a regular basis. He was allergic to chlorhexidine, which caused rash. He lived in rural New England with his wife and four children. He worked as a software engineer. He did not smoke, and he drank alcohol rarely. His mother had coronary artery disease, and a sister had had a stroke. He had three other siblings who were healthy. There was no family history of leukemia or other hematologic disorders.
On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 35.7°C. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 43. No lymphadenopathy, rashes, or skin lesions were present. The remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 5830 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), of which 39.6% were blasts. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Case 25-2021: A 48-Year-Old Man with Fatigue and Leg Swelling,"Dr. Jonathan R. Wing: A 48-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fatigue and swelling in both legs.
The patient had been well until 8 months before the current admission, when fatigue and lethargy developed. He thought the fatigue was associated with alcohol consumption and reduced his intake to 12 beers weekly; before this, he had consumed 24 beers weekly for 15 years. Three months before the current admission, the patient’s weight had decreased by 9.1 kg. However, 3 weeks before this admission, the weight had increased by 9.6 kg and swelling developed in both legs. He thought the weight gain was related to diet changes, including consumption of pizza, pasta, and soup, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
One week before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He was instructed to elevate his legs, wear compression stockings, and decrease dietary sodium to 2 g daily. On the day of the current admission, the leg swelling had not abated and new abdominal distention occurred. He called the primary care clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital.
On evaluation, a review of systems was notable for fatigue, lethargy, decreased appetite, abdominal bloating, constipation, penile swelling, decreased libido, intolerance of cold temperatures, and ankle and knee pain in both legs that was worse when the patient was climbing stairs. There was no fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, or hematochezia.
Sixteen months before the current evaluation, the patient had been admitted to this hospital with pneumonia involving the right upper and middle lobes that was due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. During that admission, he received diagnoses of diabetes and normocytic anemia. After discharge from the hospital, laboratory evaluation revealed a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.1% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4). Metformin was prescribed, and follow-up evaluation was recommended; however, the patient had not returned to the primary care clinic before the current illness.
The patient had not started taking metformin until 3 weeks before the current evaluation; he took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He lived with his wife and two children in an urban area of New England. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had Parkinson’s disease and dementia; he did not know the health of his father or paternal half-siblings.
On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 98/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.3. The patient did not have jaundice, scleral icterus, or spider angiomas. He had jugular venous distention and an S3 gallop; there were no rales. The abdomen was distended, with dullness on percussion of the flanks; there was no hepatosplenomegaly. There was 2+ symmetric pitting edema in the lower legs up to the knees. Mild palmar erythema was present; there was no asterixis.
The blood glucose level was 402 mg per deciliter (22.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]); the glycated hemoglobin level was 11.6%. The platelet count was 82,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Reece J. Goiffon: Radiography of the chest revealed new elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and atelectasis in the lower lobes. Ultrasonography with Doppler analysis of the abdomen revealed mild thickening of the gallbladder wall, coarsened liver echotexture, moderate ascites, and mild splenomegaly; the portal veins were patent. Duplex ultrasonography revealed nonocclusive deep-vein thrombosis of the right popliteal vein.
Dr. Wing: Paracentesis was performed with ultrasonographic guidance, and 50 ml of peritoneal fluid was drained. Results of peritoneal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1; cytologic examination of the fluid revealed no malignant cells. Electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature atrial complexes, left axis deviation, and T-wave inversions in leads I and aVL. Insulin and enoxaparin were administered subcutaneously, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.",Hereditary hemochromatosis.
"Case 24-2021: A 63-Year-Old Woman with Fever, Sore Throat, and Confusion","Dr. Peiyun Ni (Medicine): A 63-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of fever, headache, sore throat, and confusion.
The patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when fever, chills, myalgias, and headache developed. She also had sore throat, odynophagia, and the feeling of a “lump” in the neck. The patient was concerned that she had coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and sought evaluation at an urgent care clinic of another hospital. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative, and she was instructed to quarantine at home.
Five days before this admission, the patient returned to the clinic of the other hospital because of persistent symptoms, including daily fevers. The temperature was 37.2°C, and the remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. Testing of another nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, as was testing of an oropharyngeal swab for the rapid detection of streptococcal antigen.
On the day of admission, the patient’s sister visited the patient and noticed that she had difficulty with word finding and performing basic tasks at home. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital.
On evaluation, the patient reported fevers, chills, myalgias, fatigue, generalized weakness, headaches, sore throat, and odynophagia. She acknowledged that she had mild confusion and “mental slowness” of 2 weeks’ duration. A review of systems was notable for a lump in the neck, poor appetite, unintentional weight loss of 3 kg in the past 2 weeks, and anosmia for the past year, with onset before the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. There was no neck stiffness, photophobia, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria.
The patient had hypertension for which she took amlodipine and lisinopril; there were no known drug allergies. She was born in South America and had immigrated to the United States two decades earlier. She lived in an urban area of New England with her mother and son. Her son had a brain injury and was seen by visiting nurses daily; one nurse had had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test 4 days before this evaluation. There were no other sick contacts. The patient worked in management and enjoyed gardening as a hobby. She had no recent insect bites or travel. Although she had not been sexually active for several years, she had had an episode of unprotected sexual intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks before this evaluation. She smoked four cigarettes daily and had done so for 40 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had Alzheimer’s disease.
The temperature was 38.9°C, the blood pressure 160/80 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.9. The patient appeared fatigued and was alert and oriented. She was unable to perform simple calculations, to list the days of the week in reverse order, or to follow two-step commands. The mucous membranes were dry, and a small nontender lymph node was palpable in the posterior neck on the left side. The white-cell count was 3700 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); the aspartate aminotransferase level was 280 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32) and the alanine aminotransferase level 235 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed the presence of ketones, nitrites, and protein; there were fewer than 10 white cells per high-power field (reference range, <10). Testing of a third nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, and blood specimens were obtained for culture.

Dr. William A. Mehan: A radiograph of the chest was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed prominent gastrohepatic, periportal, periaortic, and inguinal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.4 cm in diameter.
CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed mild scattered hypodensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the intravenous administration of contrast material, was notable for multifocal patchy hyperintensities throughout the juxtacortical and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, without corresponding restricted diffusion or abnormal enhancement (Figure 1). The findings were unchanged from MRI findings obtained 3 months before presentation.

Dr. Ni: Empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and acyclovir was started, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.
A lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 24 cm of water; the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless. On CSF analysis, the total protein level was 201 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the glucose level 43 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). There were 73 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 65% were lymphocytes, 29% plasma cells, and 6% monocytes. Gram’s staining showed abundant mononuclear cells and no organisms. The intravenous administration of ceftriaxone and acyclovir was stopped.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.
Case 23-2021: A 41-Year-Old Woman with Bloody Stools and Thrombocytopenia,"Dr. Matthew B. Roberts: A 41-year-old woman who had undergone renal transplantation was admitted to this hospital because of bloody stools and thrombocytopenia.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 weeks before this admission, when mild rectal discomfort and nonbloody diarrhea developed. The episodes of diarrhea occurred several times a day and were not associated with fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
Two weeks before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at this hospital. The abdominal and rectal examinations were normal. The hemoglobin level was 11.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 14.0 to 18.0) and the platelet count 129,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Stool cultures and tests of the stool for Clostridioides difficile antigen and toxin and Shiga toxin were negative, as was examination of the stool for ova and parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with docusate was stopped, treatment with topical rectal hydrocortisone cream was started, and a recommendation was made to increase the amount of fiber in the diet. During the next week, the episodes of diarrhea decreased in frequency to once a day; however, the rectal pain persisted.

One week before this admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician because the rectal pain had worsened; she was unable to sit down, and new tenesmus was present. A rectal examination revealed mild tenderness and thin yellow-brown liquid stool, with no evidence of blood or an external anal injury. A radiograph of the abdomen was normal. Docusate, senna, and topical lidocaine jelly were prescribed.
Three days before this admission, bowel movements with tarry black and loose maroon stools and dark clots began to occur multiple times a day. When the episodes increased in frequency to every hour and there was bright-red blood per rectum, the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported severe rectal pain and burning, as well as fatigue, dizziness, and weakness. She did not report fever, chills, abdominal pain, hematemesis, hemoptysis, epistaxis, rash, bruising, hematuria, or menorrhagia.
The patient was congenitally deaf. She had received a diagnosis of kidney disease 12 years earlier, when proteinuria and hypertension developed during pregnancy and did not resolve postpartum. Pathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen had reportedly revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The patient was presumed to have Alport’s syndrome; no genetic testing had been performed.
Ten years before the current evaluation, the patient had discontinued all prescribed medications, including prednisone and labetalol, without talking to her doctors; 3 years later, she presented to this hospital with dyspnea on exertion and end-stage renal failure. Hemodialysis was started and continued until a deceased-donor renal transplantation was performed 6 months before the current evaluation.
Routine pretransplantation serologic testing of the patient revealed IgG antibodies to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and no antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV). Serologic testing of the donor also revealed IgG antibodies to EBV and no antibodies to CMV. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin, belatacept, prednisone, and everolimus was initiated; famciclovir was administered for 3 months after transplantation. Treatment with prednisone was stopped 2 months after transplantation, when diabetes developed.
At the time of the current evaluation, medications included aspirin, linagliptin, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, and omeprazole, as well as cholecalciferol, docusate, senna, topical hydrocortisone cream, and topical lidocaine jelly. The dose of everolimus had been decreased 1 month before this evaluation; belatacept had last been infused 2 weeks earlier. There were no known drug allergies.
The patient lived with her male partner and young son in an urban area of New England. She had not traveled recently. She had previously worked part-time as a teacher. There had been no exposure to animals other than two pet dogs. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol. Her sister was deaf and had a history of renal failure that had led to renal transplantation. Her father had a history of diabetes and renal failure that required hemodialysis.
On examination, the temperature was 37.2°C, the blood pressure 85/46 mm Hg, the pulse 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared pale and unwell. There was no jaundice or lymphadenopathy. There were palatal petechiae and sublingual ecchymoses, but there was no bleeding from the gums or nose. There was a healed surgical incision in the right lower abdomen and no tenderness over the renal allograft. A rectal examination revealed tenderness and dark blood with clots.
The hemoglobin level was 6.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 0 per microliter. A peripheral-blood smear showed red cells that were generally normal in size and morphology, with few hypochromic cells and rare pencil cells; there were no schistocytes or platelets. A direct antiglobulin test was negative. Blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Onofrio A. Catalano: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no bowel-wall thickening or distention. The spleen and liver were normal in size. The renal allograft was visible in the right lower quadrant (Figure 1). The transplanted kidney was enlarged and surrounded by extensive perinephric fat stranding. A small amount of free fluid was also present. There was moderate hydroureteronephrosis that extended up to the ureterovesical anastomosis. The renal collecting system, pelvis, and ureter contained spontaneously hyperdense material that was suggestive of blood breakdown products. No obstructing calculi were seen.

CT of the Renal Allograft.
Dr. Roberts: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the blood pressure increased to 97/53 mm Hg. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with everolimus and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was stopped. During the next 24 hours, 4 units of packed red cells and 5 units of pooled platelets were transfused. On the second hospital day, the hemoglobin level was 11.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 4 per microliter.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Cytomegalovirus-induced immune thrombocytopenia.
"Case 22-2021: A 64-Year-Old Woman with Cognitive Impairment, Headache, and Memory Loss","Dr. Giovanna S. Manzano (Neurology): A 64-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital with cognitive impairment, headache, and memory loss.
The patient had been well until 6 weeks before admission, when respiratory symptoms developed. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. At around the same time, coworkers observed a decline in the patient’s performance at work. The patient noticed that she was having difficulty operating computers and was forgetting her personal passwords.
The patient was evaluated at another hospital. Although she reported recent confusion and changes in cognitive performance, the examination at that time — including a neurologic examination with assessment of orientation, speech, and memory recall after 5 and 20 minutes — was unremarkable. The patient was referred for an outpatient neurologic evaluation.
One week later (5 weeks before admission), severe headache developed suddenly, along with blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea. After the administration of ondansetron, the blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea resolved; after the administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the headache became less severe, with mild pain and intermittent episodes of more severe pain.
Three weeks before admission, the patient was seen in a neurology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She had difficulty recalling the history of her symptoms. On examination, she was oriented to place and person only and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations or to spell “world” backward. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The complete blood count with differential count and test results for liver and kidney function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, thiamine, and cobalamin. Tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no distinct epileptiform activity. Topiramate was prescribed for a working diagnosis of complex migraine. Imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed diffusely scattered hyperintensities in the periventricular, subcortical, and deep white matter and leptomeningeal enhancement. In addition, there was evidence of frontal superficial siderosis and a few scattered microhemorrhages.
Dr. Manzano: Lumbar puncture was also performed. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, the white-cell count was 46 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with a lymphocyte count of 99% (reference range, 40 to 80), the red-cell count was 35 per microliter (reference value, 0), and the protein level was 221 mg per deciliter (reference range, 13 to 40); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of the CSF were negative. The administration of topiramate was stopped; treatment with oral doxycycline was started but then was stopped after 5 days, when results of a test for Borrelia burgdorferi were interpreted as negative.
Over the next 3 weeks, intermittent headache persisted and cognitive impairment worsened. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital. She was unable to provide a history. According to the patient’s husband, the patient had stopped working and was no longer able to effectively care for herself, requiring assistance with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, and eating. She had difficulty planning and was unable to put on clothes in the correct sequence or to turn on the shower. Memory impairment persisted, conversation was tangential, and visual hallucinations frequently occurred. The patient had lost 6.8 kg in the past month. There was no fever, rash, or joint pain.
The patient had a history of poliomyelitis in childhood, with residual mild weakness in the left leg; vitamin B12 deficiency, which had been corrected; and hypothyroidism. Medications included atorvastatin, levothyroxine, sertraline, vitamin B12, and cholecalciferol. She had a known allergy to amoxicillin–clavulanate with an unknown reaction. She was a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history, and she had consumed four alcoholic beverages per week before the onset of the current illness. The patient worked in a health care clinic and lived with her husband in a suburban area of New England. She had not traveled outside the United States. She was an avid gardener; she had a dog but no other animal exposures. Her father had received a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease at 62 years of age.
On examination, the patient was alert and interactive. The temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 105/51 mm Hg, the heart rate 56 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.4. The patient was oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was fluent, with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. She had impaired abstraction and mildly impaired attention. She was unable to recall three objects after a delay. Intermittently during the examination, she had visual hallucinations that she knew were not real. Cranial nerve examination was unremarkable. Strength was 5/5 throughout, except in the left leg (4/5). Reflexes were brisk throughout, including 3+ reflexes in the arms and the right lower leg; pectoralis reflexes and a jaw jerk were present. No ankle clonus was noted. Examinations for tone, sensation, and cerebellar function were unremarkable. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Gonzalez: MRI of the head was performed (Figure 1). FLAIR images showed slight progression of the diffuse subarachnoid hyperintensities and leptomeningeal enhancement. Susceptibility-weighted images showed frontal superficial siderosis and scattered lobar microhemorrhages. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head revealed patent cranial vessels, without evidence of aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or thrombosis. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal.
FIGURE 1

MRI of the Head.
Dr. Manzano: Lumbar puncture was performed. On CSF analysis, the nucleated-cell count was 28 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), the lymphocyte count 85%, the red-cell count 53 per microliter, and the protein level 280 mg per deciliter. CSF was sent for culture and cytologic studies; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An EEG was normal.
The patient was admitted to this hospital, and intravenous ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and methylprednisolone were administered. During the first 48 hours, the patient was agitated and impulsive. Visual hallucinations worsened, and olanzapine was administered. The CSF culture was negative, and the CSF cytologic studies showed no malignant cells.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Cerebral amyloid angiopathy–related inflammation.
"Case 21-2021: A 33-Year-Old Pregnant Woman with Fever, Abdominal Pain, and Headache","Dr. Kathy M. Tran: A 33-year-old pregnant woman with ulcerative colitis was admitted to this hospital during the summer at 10 weeks of gestation because of fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, and headache.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before this admission, when fever, rigors, nausea, and vomiting developed. During the next 3 days, the symptoms worsened; the patient was unable to eat, drink, or take medications. She reported abdominal pain and cramping on the left side that she described as being similar to previous flares of ulcerative colitis; she also had nonbloody diarrhea. The patient called the obstetrics clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital.
A review of systems was notable for fatigue, mild headache, neck pain, and photophobia. The patient reported no hematochezia, pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, dysuria, or joint pain. Ulcerative colitis had been diagnosed 11 years earlier; at the time of the diagnosis, she began treatment with azathioprine but stopped after 1 year because of severe fatigue. The patient had taken mesalamine and sulfasalazine intermittently for disease flares but typically stopped after a few months of treatment. Exacerbations of ulcerative colitis occurred approximately every year and were associated with fevers, rigors, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea.
Nine months before this admission, Clostridioides difficile colitis developed, and the patient was successfully treated with oral vancomycin. Three weeks before the current admission, she was admitted to this hospital for a flare of ulcerative colitis; intravenous methylprednisolone, hydromorphone, and ondansetron were administered, and mesalamine was restarted. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed mild erythema and friable mucosa with a decreased vascular pattern in the sigmoid colon.
Dr. Craig R. Audin: A transvaginal ultrasound image obtained during that admission showed a single viable intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks of gestation and trace subchorionic hemorrhage.
Dr. Tran: The patient was discharged after 7 days once most of the symptoms had abated, although nausea persisted. The patient had had two previous successful pregnancies that had resulted in cesarean deliveries at full term. The patient reported that she had received all the usual childhood immunizations. Routine prenatal serologic screening during the current pregnancy showed immunity to varicella but not to rubella. Tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Other history included anemia, chronic back pain, migraines, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety.
At the time of the current admission, medications included prednisone, mesalamine, omeprazole, ondansetron, hydromorphone, tramadol, cyclobenzaprine, sumatriptan, gabapentin, lorazepam, sertraline, pyridoxine, cholecalciferol, and prenatal vitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with her male partner, with whom she was monogamous, as well as her two children. She worked as an administrator. She did not eat sushi or rare or raw meat, and she did not consume unpasteurized milk or cheese. She had no known sick contacts or exposure to animals. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. Her mother had coronary artery disease, her father inflammatory bowel disease, and her sister depression. Her brother and two children were well.
On examination, the temperature was 38.2°C, the blood pressure 118/61 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared tired and uncomfortable. The abdominal examination was remarkable for a healed surgical scar; there was diffuse tenderness that was most painful in the lower quadrants. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level was 7.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), which was similar to the patient’s baseline level. Urinalysis was normal. Blood specimens were obtained for microbiologic culture. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Audin: Color Doppler ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed mild fullness in the pelvicalyceal system on the right side (Figure 1A) that is probably a physiologic finding in pregnancy. There was trace fluid in the right lower quadrant; however, the appendix was not visualized (Figure 1B).
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies of the Abdomen.
Dr. Tran: Intravenous fluids, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and hydromorphone were administered; mesalamine was continued, and a tapering of the prednisone dose was begun. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and care.
The next day, the abdominal pain persisted and was most severe in the right upper and right lower quadrants. The headache had increased in severity; it was pulsating in quality and was worst in the frontal region, with radiation to the occipital region and posterior neck. There was mild photophobia but no neck stiffness or limitation in the range of motion in the neck. Empirical treatment with intravenous ampicillin–sulbactam and prophylaxis with oral vancomycin were started.
On the third hospital day, the systolic blood pressure declined to 70 mm Hg; after intravenous fluids were administered, the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Ultrasound images of the uterus obtained at the bedside confirmed a fetal heartbeat. A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless, with a glucose level of 63 mg per deciliter (3.5 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a protein level of 17 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were 0 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5). Gram’s staining of the CSF revealed no neutrophils and very few mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified.
Dr. Audin: Three days later, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1C through 1F), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a normal gravid uterus. On T2-weighted imaging, there were rounded areas of myometrial thickening with low signal intensity that were consistent with focal myometrial contractions, as well as a thin band of low signal intensity surrounding the fetus that was consistent with chorioamniotic separation; both of these findings were considered to be normal in the first trimester. The appendix was normal, without wall thickening, dilatation, or adjacent inflammatory changes. Although evaluation of the bowel was limited in the absence of oral and intravenous contrast material, the rectum also appeared normal, without obvious signs of active or chronic inflammation.
A diagnosis was made.",Listeria monocytogenes bacteremia resulting in loss of fetus.
Case 20-2021: A 69-Year-Old Man with Ataxia,"Dr. Claudio M. de Gusmao: A 69-year-old man was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of progressively worsening ataxia.
The patient had been well until 9 years before this evaluation, when abnormal gait and impaired coordination developed. He was unable to walk in a straight line; he bumped into walls when walking down a hallway. He also had difficulty reading traffic signs while driving and noted a change in the quality of his voice. The patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of another hospital and began physical therapy.
During the next several years, symptoms gradually worsened despite physical therapy. The patient was no longer able to drive or play golf, and he intermittently used a walker because of unsteadiness. He had frequent falls, including one that led to fractures in six ribs. His speech changes worsened, such that he could no longer sing. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for evaluation.
In the neurology clinic, the patient reported frequent bowel movements, approximately 10 per day. He had no vertigo, lightheadedness, hearing loss, tremor, erectile dysfunction, disturbance of sleep, or urinary incontinence. He reported a sense of visual disorientation with head movement and with changes in the direction of gaze. He had a history of hyperlipidemia. Medications included atorvastatin, cetirizine, and a multivitamin; there were no known drug allergies. The patient had recently moved from an urban area in the southeastern United States to a suburban area of New England. He drank one glass of wine nightly; additional alcohol use caused worsening of ataxia and dysarthria. He had previously smoked five cigarettes daily but had quit smoking 30 years before this evaluation; he did not use illicit drugs.
The patient’s mother had died of heart failure at an elderly age, and his father had died after a stroke and myocardial infarction at 70 years of age. The patient had two adult children, who were healthy. His two brothers and one of his sisters had celiac disease; the sister also reportedly had a shuffling gait. The sister’s daughter had received a diagnosis of Turner’s syndrome and had been seen by a neurologist for a balance disturbance. A brother’s grandson also had celiac disease and a gait disturbance (Figure 1).
FIGURE 1

Family History.
The temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg, and the pulse 72 beats per minute. The patient was alert, oriented, and attentive and provided a detailed history. He had moderate dysarthria, with impairment in the rate, rhythm, and clarity of speech. An oculomotor examination revealed complete and conjugate gaze in all directions; he had intact smooth pursuit movements but had slow, dysmetric saccades. Results of a head impulse test were abnormal, with corrective saccades noted bilaterally. Normal tone and full strength were present in all major muscle groups of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric at the knees but absent at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Rapid tapping of the index fingers on the thumbs was dysrhythmic and uncoordinated. Finger–nose–finger testing revealed mild intention tremor. Heel-to-shin testing revealed symmetric jerking movements with lateral movements across the shins. Vibration and joint-position senses in the legs were profoundly decreased: the patient was unable to sense vibration at the toes, had a decreased ability to sense vibration at the knees, and had difficulty discerning the position of his big toe with his eyes closed. There was sway in his stance, regardless of whether his eyes were open, and he could not stand with the feet together. The patient walked without support. He had a wide-based gait with considerable staggering and jerky, stiff movements of the legs. He was unable to maintain balance in a tandem stance or to walk with a tandem gait.
The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were test results for kidney, liver, and thyroid function; antibodies to thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin were not detected. Blood levels of cyanocobalamin, methylmalonic acid, vitamin E, and glycated hemoglobin were normal; anti–glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were not detected. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Genetic testing revealed no mutations in genes associated with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8. Clinical testing of otolith function revealed abnormal vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials on the left side. Nerve-conduction studies revealed absent or barely detectable responses in the bilateral sural nerves, left superficial peroneal nerve, left median nerve, left ulnar nerve, and right radial nerve. Results of motor nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were results of a modified barium-swallow evaluation. A previous workup at another hospital for chronic diarrhea had reportedly been normal, with no evidence of malabsorption.
Dr. McKinley Glover: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss and prominent cerebellar volume loss, most notably involving the vermis and superior cerebellar hemispheres. There was mild flattening of the superior margin of the midbrain, and the ratio of midbrain to ventral pons was mildly reduced at 0.51 (reference range, >0.52).1 The anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain was 8.90 mm (reference range, >9.35).1 There was no abnormal signal in the pons, and the middle cerebellar peduncles were normal. There was a chronic lacunar infarct of the right thalamus.

Dr. de Gusmao: Additional history was obtained, and a diagnosis was made.","Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome due to a biallelic expansion in RFC1."
"Case 19-2021: A 54-Year-Old Man with Irritability, Confusion, and Odd Behaviors","Dr. David P. Bullis (Behavioral Medicine, Newton–Wellesley Hospital, Newton, MA): A 54-year-old man was evaluated by the neuropsychology service of this hospital because of irritability, confusion, and odd behaviors.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before the current evaluation, when he received a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue that had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. He underwent surgical dissection of the neck and resection of the tongue base on the right side, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy, which resulted in cancer remission. After treatment, neck pain and shoulder weakness developed and was attributed to postoperative neuropathy involving the right spinal accessory nerve.
In the context of this illness and persistent pain, the patient sought care at the cancer center behavioral medicine clinic of this hospital and received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. During the next 8 months, the patient was seen for psychotherapy approximately every 2 weeks. Treatment for the pain included physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, trigger-point injections, and the use of a scapular elevation brace. Therapy with oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin, tizanidine, and duloxetine was started. Four months before the current evaluation, a sural nerve graft was placed in the right spinal accessory nerve from the proximal, functioning portion to the distal portion, but the pain and weakness did not abate.
Six weeks before the current evaluation, the patient did not respond to telephone calls for 24 hours. The police were called and found the patient unresponsive with prescription medication bottles nearby. Emergency medical services personnel arrived, and the initial evaluation, in the patient’s home, was notable for a severely decreased respiratory rate. Naloxone was administered, the trachea was intubated, and the patient was taken to a local hospital. In the emergency department, the patient was pulseless with ongoing electrocardiographic activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and epinephrine was administered; after 4 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The dose of methadone was decreased, and therapy with oxycodone, gabapentin, and tizanidine was stopped. During the subsequent 6 days, septic shock, aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and delirium occurred. When these problems resolved, the patient was discharged home.
Five weeks before the current evaluation, the patient participated in a video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic. He expressed embarrassment and frustration related to his apparent accidental overdose. He described persistent depression, increased anxiety, and no other new symptoms.
Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient missed a routine video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic, and his family was called. For the preceding 2 weeks, they had noticed that the patient was uncharacteristically agitated, irritable, talking loudly, and verbally abusive. Odd behaviors were reported. The patient had gotten lost while driving to a friend’s house that he visited frequently, had been pulled over by police for driving erratically (with normal results on a breathalyzer test), and on another occasion, had been found walking along the highway under an overpass. He called family members repeatedly in the middle of the night, and he would not answer when the calls were returned. When the family requested a police wellness check of the patient, the patient retaliated by requesting a police wellness check of the family members. After this incident, the family was advised to take the patient to a local hospital for admission.
At the local hospital, the patient reported no symptoms and noted that he had stopped taking methadone because he was concerned about a medication overdose. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 19, indicating cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.1 Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nonspecific hypodensity in the centrum semiovale on the left side. The patient was told he had mild dementia. Visiting nurse services were arranged, and the patient was discharged home.
One week before the current evaluation, the patient’s family reported that he had increased confusion and odd behaviors. He was unable to recall details of conversations that had happened minutes before. He could not operate the telephone or remote control and had emptied the trash can into the toilet. He had asked for his clothes to be cut off because he felt uncomfortable. Family members had been staying with the patient every night since his recent discharge because they were concerned about his safety. A neuropsychological evaluation was requested.
Dr. Michael W. Parsons: The evaluation was conducted by the cancer center neuropsychology service of this hospital with the use of videoconferencing technology to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient acknowledged only minimal cognitive changes and was dismissive of the family’s concerns. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, moderate depression, mild anxiety, and difficulty sleeping and keeping track of time.
Additional history obtained from the patient’s family included insomnia, lumbar disk herniation, olecranon bursitis, and an inguinal hernia that had led to surgical repair in early adulthood. He had had multiple concussions as a teenager, as well as a brief loss of consciousness during a motor vehicle collision 3 years earlier. After the collision, fatigue, headaches, difficulty concentrating, and impaired memory occurred; during the subsequent 2 years, occupational therapy was provided, and the symptoms gradually resolved.
Medications at the time of evaluation included ibuprofen, acetaminophen, duloxetine, trazodone, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and multivitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England with family members nearby. He had completed a master’s degree and had had a successful career; he had taken a leave of absence from work 9 months earlier in anticipation of cancer treatment. After cancer treatment, he had been unable to return to work because of pain. He was athletic, walked 3 miles daily, and enjoyed golfing. He rarely drank alcohol and had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs. His family history included breast cancer and dementia in his mother, hearing loss and hypertension in his father, metastatic cancer with an unknown primary source in his paternal grandfather, glaucoma and alcohol use disorder in his maternal grandmother, and a brain tumor in a more distant relative.
On video neuropsychological examination, the patient was in no distress and was adequately groomed, with normal-appearing hygiene. His affect was irritable, and the fact that he reported no symptoms suggested limited insight. His spontaneous speech was fluent and well articulated. His thoughts were tangential, and he was frequently forgetful and easily distracted; his information processing speed was slow. A formal neuropsychological assessment revealed impaired executive functioning, marked by disinhibition and poor working memory, as well as deficits in recent memory, verbal fluency, and information processing speed.
Dr. Bullis: A diagnostic test was performed.",Delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy.
"Case 18-2021: An 81-Year-Old Man with Cough, Fever, and Shortness of Breath","Dr. Matthew J. Emmett (Medicine): An 81-year-old man was admitted to this hospital with fever, cough, and shortness of breath during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 days before this admission, when fever and cough developed. On the morning of admission, he noted an abrupt onset of shortness of breath at rest and dyspnea on exertion. There was also substernal chest pain on the left side that worsened with deep breaths and when he lay down. The patient’s son called emergency medical services, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
On arrival at the emergency department, the patient described ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath. The son reported that the patient had fallen at home 2 days before admission, but the patient did not remember falling and the son was not able to provide details about the nature or circumstances of the fall. The patient reported no pain in his abdomen, arms, legs, or groin and no headache.
The patient had a history of hypertension. During a previous evaluation for cough, he was reportedly told that he had a lung disease that had “caused the lung tissue to harden.” Before the onset of his most recent symptoms, he had walked outside on a daily basis without limitation from shortness of breath. He took an unknown medication for hypertension. The patient did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. He lived in an apartment with his wife.
On examination, the temperature was 37.9°C, the blood pressure 157/95 mm Hg, the pulse 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The respiratory rate decreased to 28 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation improved to 96% with the administration of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22.8. Retractions were noted in the supraclavicular areas. Inspiratory crackles could be heard at the lung bases. The heart sounds were regular, with tachycardia but no murmur. There was no tenderness on palpation of the chest wall and no edema in the legs. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Reece J. Goiffon: A single-view portable anteroposterior radiograph of the chest showed bilateral patchy airspace opacities that were more extensive in the left lung than in the right lung, with predominance in the peripheral lower lung zones and with relative sparing of the perihilar regions (Figure 1). These opacities were superimposed on mild apical and bibasilar bronchiectasis and bibasilar reticular opacities. A radiograph of the pelvis showed no fracture.
FIGURE 1

Chest Radiograph.
Dr. Emmett: An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Blood samples were obtained for culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was submitted to test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.
On arrival at the medical floor, the patient was in respiratory distress, with a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 86% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The patient was restless and appeared uncomfortable, moving around in the bed and attempting to sit up; he reported severe pleuritic chest pain. The oxygen flow rate was adjusted to 5 liters per minute, and morphine was administered intravenously. A repeat electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and acute pulmonary embolism.
"Case 17-2021: An 82-Year-Old Woman with Pain, Swelling, and Ecchymosis of the Left Arm","Dr. Vishwajith Sridharan (Medicine): An 82-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital with pain, swelling, and ecchymosis of the left arm.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 days before admission, when she awoke from sleep with swelling and discoloration of the skin of the left arm above the elbow. There was no history of trauma to the arm. Over the next 2 days, the swelling and discoloration spread to the elbow and forearm and pain developed. The patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.
On examination, the temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 153/65 mm Hg, the pulse 59 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. Ecchymosis extended from above the left elbow to the left wrist, and there was pain with palpation of the left forearm. The radial pulse was normal, as was range of motion in the left elbow and wrist. Radiographs of the left forearm showed diffuse osteopenia and degenerative changes of the wrist joint, without fractures or bone lesions. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Ibuprofen was administered, and the patient was given a shoulder sling for comfort and discharged home.

Over the next 2 days, the pain in the left arm worsened and the ecchymosis spread to the left hand and digits. The pain did not abate with the use of ice packs or acetaminophen or with elevation of the arm. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported pain in the left arm that occurred with supination or while she was making a fist. There was no numbness or tingling in the arm or hand or history of hemarthrosis, prolonged bleeding with dental procedures, or menorrhagia. The medical history was notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery stenosis, osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease, and obesity, as well as an episode of deep venous thrombosis 40 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol. The patient had smoked tobacco for 40 years but had quit 22 years earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She was widowed and lived alone but visited with her grown children regularly. Her father had had coronary artery disease.
On examination, the temperature was 36.1°C, the blood pressure 169/77 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 72.5 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.3. There was discoloration of the left arm with sharp demarcation in the middle of the upper arm, proximal to the elbow, and uniform extension to the metacarpophalangeal joints (Figure 1). There was tenderness with palpation of the forearm and dorsal wrist, passive range of motion of the wrist and elbow, and diffuse swelling and mild firmness of the forearm, without induration. Sensation to light touch was intact throughout the arm and hand. The radial pulse was normal, and the fingers were warm, with brisk capillary refill in all the digits. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney- and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
FIGURE 1

Clinical Photograph of the Left Arm.
Dr. Patrick D. Sutphin: Computed tomography (CT) of the left arm, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed disproportionate enlargement of the brachioradialis muscle, a finding suggestive of intramuscular hematoma. There was hyperdense stranding in the subcutaneous fat centered over the elbow and forearm, a finding consistent with hemorrhage (Figure 2). CT angiography of the arteries revealed heavy, partially calcified plaque throughout the thoracic aorta. Focal heavy plaque in the left subclavian artery proximal to the vertebral artery resulted in approximately 70 to 80% stenosis (Figure 3). The arteries in the left arm were otherwise patent. There were no signs of active hemorrhage on arterial or delayed-phase images or findings that could lead to localization of an arterial injury, such as pseudoaneurysm or dissection. In addition, an enhancing mass was not identified. The visualized superficial and deep veins were patent on delayed-phase images.

Case 16-2021: A 37-Year-Old Woman with Abdominal Pain and Aortic Dilatation,"Dr. Adam Tanious (Surgery): A 37-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of abdominal pain and aortic dilatation.
The patient had been well until 3 weeks before the current admission, when she began to have pain in the right side of the abdomen that radiated to the back. She also had nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. Approximately 2 weeks before the current admission, she sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. Physical examination was notable for pain with palpation of all four quadrants. The pulses were normal, and the blood pressure did not differ substantially between the two arms or between the two legs. The white-cell count was 9800 per microliter (reference range at the other hospital, 4800 to 10,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 41 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the C-reactive protein level 44.0 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 10.0). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood specimens were obtained for two sets of bacterial cultures, with each set consisting of an aerobic bottle and an anaerobic bottle.

Dr. Patrick D. Sutphin: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed soft-tissue density adjacent to the infrarenal abdominal aorta and mild-to-moderate associated periaortic fat stranding (Figure 1A and 1B). These findings prompted CT angiography, performed 1 hour later, which more clearly delineated infrarenal abdominal aortic wall thickening at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery, with an aortic diameter of 2.3 cm (Figure 1C).
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Tanious: The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital on the same day, with a referral to the rheumatology clinic of that hospital and instructions to start treatment with prednisone. One day after discharge, one of the four culture bottles grew gram-positive bacilli, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital for investigation. After an evaluation, the positive culture was presumed to be contaminated. Additional blood specimens were obtained for culture, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day.
The fever and chills resolved, and the abdominal pain abated initially but then gradually worsened. Eight days after discharge and 3 days before the current admission, the patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 50 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 146/78 mm Hg. Physical examination was notable for diffuse abdominal tenderness, which was worse with deep palpation in all four quadrants. The white-cell count was 32,800 per microliter, the platelet count 565,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level 110.0 mg per liter. The urinalysis was normal; urine toxicologic screening was positive for amphetamines, cannabinoids, and opiates. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Sutphin: CT angiography revealed progression of aortic wall thickening and periaortic fat stranding and interval narrowing of the proximal segment of the inferior mesenteric artery, with an increase in the aortic diameter to 3.1 cm.
Dr. Tanious: The patient was admitted to the other hospital for a second time. Intravenous fluids, methylprednisolone, and heparin were administered, as was empirical treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam. During the next 3 days, the patient remained afebrile. Consultations with the rheumatology, infectious diseases, and vascular surgery departments were requested.
Dr. Sutphin: On the second hospital day, magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen revealed an increase in aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta (aortic diameter, 3.6 cm) with enhancement of the aortic wall. On the fourth hospital day, CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a further increase in aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta (aortic diameter, 3.9 cm) with increasing luminal irregularity and periaortic fat stranding.
Dr. Tanious: The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional treatment. On evaluation, she reported abdominal pain that was worst in the right upper quadrant and radiated to the right lower quadrant, back, and chest. She rated the pain as 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She also reported nausea but had not had fevers or chills since before the initial presentation. A review of systems was notable for the absence of fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, myalgias, joint pain, and rash; blue fingertips occurred with exposure to cold.
Dr. Sutphin: CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed evidence of continued aneurysmal enlargement and increased luminal irregularity (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F).
Dr. Tanious: The patient had a history of polycystic ovary syndrome, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder, asthma, and Chiari I malformation, which had led to suboccipital craniectomy 3 years earlier. She had undergone cesarean section 5 years earlier. Medications included prednisone, clonidine, promethazine, dicyclomine, and inhaled albuterol; latex had caused a rash. The patient was White, lived in an urban area of New England, and had recently been homeless. She had injected heroin for the past 5 years; her last injection had been 3 weeks earlier. She had a history of marijuana use and reported no methamphetamine use. Sexual history was not obtained. She drank four alcoholic beverages and smoked one pack of cigarettes daily. Her sister had rheumatoid arthritis, her grandmother had tuberculosis, and several family members had hypermobility of the joints.
On examination, the patient was uncomfortable because of the abdominal pain. The abdomen was soft, with diffuse tenderness that was worst in the right upper quadrant and both lower quadrants. She did not have any ulcers, rash, lymphadenopathy, or warmth, redness, or swelling of the joints; the elbows and metacarpophalangeal joints were hyperextensible. The white-cell count was 27,710 per microliter (reference range at this hospital, 4500 to 11,000), the platelet count 576,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 57 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the C-reactive protein level 60.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 8.0). Testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was negative. Serologic testing for hepatitis C virus was positive. The blood-culture isolate detected at the other hospital was identified as bacillus species, and all other blood cultures performed at the other hospital showed no growth. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Management decisions were made.",Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and infection of a vascular graft.
"Case 15-2021: A 76-Year-Old Woman with Nausea, Diarrhea, and Acute Kidney Failure","Dr. Arielle J. Medford: A 76-year-old woman with heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus was admitted to this hospital with nausea, diarrhea, and acute kidney failure.
The patient normally lived independently, but she had been staying in a skilled nursing facility for the past several weeks to recover from a recent humeral fracture. During her stay, nausea, abdominal cramps, and nonbloody diarrhea developed. The next day, the symptoms persisted, and she was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital.
Approximately 3 months before the current admission, the patient was admitted to this hospital with respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of heart failure and pneumonia. She was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline for 5 days, and diuretic agents were adjusted during a 3-week hospitalization. Nine weeks before the current admission, the patient’s condition returned to baseline, and she was discharged home with instructions to continue a diuretic regimen of torsemide and spironolactone. The patient’s dry weight was 127 kg. Laboratory test results at the time of discharge are shown in Table 1.

Four weeks before the current admission, the patient lost her balance while walking and fell onto her right side. She had no loss of consciousness, chest pain, or other symptoms. She was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital and reported pain in her right arm. On examination, there were abrasions and bruising over the right elbow, with tenderness on palpation; the weight was 123 kg. The right radial pulse was normal, and sensation was intact in the arm and hand. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the right arm showed a mild transcondylar fracture of the right distal humerus. A splint was placed, and the patient was advised not to bear weight with the right arm. She was discharged to a skilled nursing facility for increased support with daily activities while she was recovering.
Two weeks before the current admission, while the patient was staying in the skilled nursing facility, edema developed in both legs, and her weight increased by 5 kg. She attributed the weight gain to increased salt intake. Nine days before the current admission, oral metolazone was added to her diuretic regimen, and the leg edema resolved.
At the time of the current admission, the patient reported nausea and abdominal cramps. She reported no fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, dysuria, flank pain, or vomiting. She had no known sick contacts. Her medical history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obstructive sleep apnea, for which nightly treatment with continuous positive airway pressure had been prescribed. Medications included allopurinol, amiodarone, aspirin, atorvastatin, cyclobenzaprine, enoxaparin, fluticasone, glipizide, loratadine, lorazepam, metformin, metolazone, metoprolol, sertraline, spironolactone, torsemide, warfarin, and zolpidem. The last doses of metolazone, spironolactone, and torsemide were taken more than 24 hours before admission. There were no known drug allergies. Before the recent humeral fracture, the patient had been living alone in an urban area of New England; she required assistance from home health services for bathing and chores and used a walker for ambulation. She did not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol. She had no recent history of travel, and her family history was unremarkable.
On examination, the patient appeared well, without respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 137/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 126 kg. The oral mucous membranes were dry. The heart sounds were normal, as were the breath sounds throughout both lung fields. There was no edema in the lower legs. The right arm was in a splint.
The blood level of creatinine was 7.66 mg per deciliter (677 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]), and the level of lactic acid was 7.4 mmol per liter (67 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18 mg per deciliter]). Urinalysis by dipstick showed a pH of 5.0 (reference range, 5.0 to 9.0) and a specific gravity of 1.012 (reference range, 1.001 to 1.035), and no protein, blood, nitrites, leukocyte esterase, glucose, or ketones were present. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Chest radiography revealed mild pulmonary interstitial edema. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and urinary tract revealed simple cysts in the left kidney, with no evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
Intravenous fluids were administered, and a diagnosis was made.",Lactic acidosis due to toxic effects from metformin use.
Case 14-2021: A 64-Year-Old Woman with Fever and Pancytopenia,"Dr. Kathleen W. Miller (Medicine): A 64-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in early winter with fever and pancytopenia.
The patient, who had multiple sclerosis, had been in her usual state of health until 7 months before admission, when nausea and fatigue developed. Over the next 2 months, these symptoms worsened, and in the context of severe nausea, two episodes of vasovagal syncope occurred. During an evaluation for syncope, anemia was noted. Five months before admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care provider at another hospital. The weight was 87.6 kg, and the results of physical examination were normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, cobalamin, folate, iron, iron saturation, and total iron-binding capacity were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Iron supplementation was prescribed.

Nausea and fatigue persisted. Three months before admission, the patient was again evaluated by her primary care provider at the other hospital. The weight was 84.4 kg; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed cholelithiasis and splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 17 cm in the craniocaudal dimension (normal value, ≤12 cm).
Two and a half months before admission, the patient was evaluated in a hematology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She reported persistent nausea and fatigue, poor appetite with reduced oral intake, and 2 weeks of dyspnea on exertion. There was no orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The weight was 83.2 kg, and the spleen tip was palpable four fingerbreadths below the costal margin; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, and examination of the bone marrow specimen revealed mildly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and mild dyserythropoiesis.
Treatment with prednisone and folic acid was begun. Ocrelizumab infusions for multiple sclerosis were stopped. Nausea and fatigue persisted, and fevers and sweats developed. After 3 weeks of treatment with prednisone, the anemia had not abated and the patient had temperatures as high as 39.0°C. Testing for influenza A and B viruses was negative. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The course of prednisone was tapered off over the next 18 days, and the patient was referred to a hematologist affiliated with this hospital.
In the hematology clinic, the patient reported that the fevers had resolved but the fatigue, weakness, and poor appetite had worsened. She felt too fatigued to walk, and she had recently had a fall without loss of consciousness. The weight was 82.4 kg; splenomegaly was present, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.
In addition to relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis, there was a history of trigeminal neuralgia, restless legs syndrome, vasovagal syncope when blood samples were obtained, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level for 1 year without a clear cause. Medications included oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, ropinirole, folic acid, and cholecalciferol. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had quit smoking 20 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her adult son and pet cat and dog. Her backyard adjoined a large wooded area where deer were often seen. She worked in health care administration. Her family history included diabetes in her mother, lung cancer in her father, and multiple sclerosis in her sister.
On examination, the patient appeared pale but not unwell. The temperature was 38.3°C, the blood pressure 90/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 93 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.2. The conjunctivae were pale. The heart rate was regular, with normal first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) and a soft systolic murmur. There was edema in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis and coagulation tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was administered. Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered daily for 3 days, and the patient reported a decrease in weakness and fatigue.
Dr. Dexter P. Mendoza: On hospital day 4, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1A) revealed splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 19 cm in the craniocaudal dimension. Concurrent positron-emission tomography with injection of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (Figure 1B) revealed intense uptake in the spleen and diffuse uptake in the bone marrow throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Miller: On hospital day 5, the patient reported a recurrence of severe fatigue and generalized weakness. The temperature was 39.0°C and the heart rate 130 beats per minute. The results of physical examination were otherwise unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
A diagnostic test result was received.",Babesiosis
Case 13-2021: A Newborn Girl with a Neck Mass,"Dr. Katherine A. Sparger: A newborn girl was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of this hospital after a planned delivery by cesarean section because of a neck mass.
During pregnancy, the patient’s mother was 41 years old (gravida 3, para 1) and received prenatal care at another hospital. At 7 weeks of gestation, vaginal bleeding occurred because of a subchorionic hematoma. At 10 weeks of gestation, the mother’s blood thyrotropin level was 0.01 μU per milliliter (reference range, 0.40 to 5.00); levels of free thyroxine (free T4) and total triiodothyronine (total T3) were not obtained. At 19 weeks of gestation, the thyrotropin level was 0.44 μU per milliliter and an ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy was normal. During the third trimester, gestational diabetes was diagnosed; glycemic control was maintained with dietary changes.
Four weeks before delivery, at 34 weeks 6 days of gestation, a routine transvaginal ultrasonographic survey of fetal growth revealed a new mass on the right side of the fetus’s neck that measured 2.6 cm by 3.4 cm by 3.0 cm. The mother was referred to the obstetrics clinic of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.
Dr. Randheer Shailam: At 35 weeks 6 days of gestation, obstetrical ultrasonography performed at this hospital (Figure 1A) confirmed the presence of a 4.6-cm mass on the right side of the neck. The mass was hyperechoic and well circumscribed and had internal vascularity; the remainder of the survey of fetal anatomy was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the fetus, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 1B, 1C, and 1D), revealed displacement of the trachea without compression.
FIGURE 1

Prenatal Imaging Studies.
Dr. Sparger: For multiple weeks, the fetal biophysical profile score was 8 out of 8, indicating normal breathing motion, movement, tone, and amniotic fluid volume. The mother met with providers from Maternal–Fetal Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Otolaryngology, and Neonatology to discuss the plan for delivery and neonatal airway management at birth, including the possibility of an ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure. The mother initially had a preference for a vaginal delivery, given her history of a successful vaginal delivery with a previous pregnancy. However, after conversations with Maternal–Fetal Medicine providers, the decision was made to proceed with a scheduled cesarean section at 39 weeks of gestation to minimize the risks of labor dystocia and asynclitism due to fetal neck position and any associated birth trauma, as well as to allow for controlled timing of the delivery with multidisciplinary team members present.
The mother had a history of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and known mutations in both copies of the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Eleven years earlier, her first pregnancy had ended at full term with a vaginal delivery. Three years earlier, her second pregnancy had ended at 13 weeks of gestation with elective termination because of the diagnosis of pentalogy of Cantrell (a syndrome of midline abdominal and chest wall defects, including ectopia cordis and omphalocele). During her current pregnancy, she had taken prenatal vitamins, cholecalciferol, and pyridoxine, as well as lorazepam as needed for anxiety. Prenatal screening tests were negative for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B; equivocal for immunity to rubella; and positive for group B streptococcal colonization.
The patient (baby) had a healthy father and sister. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her maternal grandmother, sleep apnea in her paternal grandfather, and diabetes in her paternal grandmother. In addition, her maternal aunt had thyrotoxicosis, a paternal uncle had diabetes, and another paternal uncle had blindness, deafness, and cognitive developmental delay.
At 39 weeks of gestation, the baby was delivered by cesarean section. The birth weight was 3060 g (35th percentile), the length 48 cm (26th percentile), and the head circumference 34.5 cm (60th percentile). She had a spontaneous cry, decreased tone, and spontaneous respirations. There was a large firm mass on the right side of the neck. The 1-minute Apgar score was 6.
At 3 minutes of life, increased work of breathing developed; treatment with continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm of water was administered. At 5 minutes of life, the Apgar score was 7 but the increased work of breathing worsened, with nasal flaring, grunting, and subcostal retractions; the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) was increased to 100%. At 10 minutes of life, the Apgar score was 8. Direct laryngoscopy revealed deviation of the trachea, larynx, subglottis, and right piriform sinus. Tracheal intubation was performed with rigid bronchoscopy; because of clinically significant airway obstruction, tracheostomy was performed.
At 8 hours of life, the blood hemoglobin level was 10.0 g per deciliter (reference range for neonates, 13.5 to 19.5), the thyrotropin level 3.82 μU per milliliter, the alpha-fetoprotein level 107,048.0 ng per milliliter (reference range, <7.9), and the beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level 7.3 IU per milliliter (reference range, <50.0). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Shailam: On ultrasonography of the head and neck (Figure 2A), the mass on the right side of the neck measured 3.7 cm by 3.8 cm by 3.1 cm and was markedly hypervascular, with lateral displacement of the internal jugular vein and carotid artery. On MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the neck, performed with and without the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 2B and 2C), the mass appeared to arise from the sympathetic chain.

Postnatal Imaging Studies.
Dr. Sparger: During the first week of life, the vital signs remained normal, except for intermittent oxygen desaturation events while the patient was breathing through a humidified tracheostomy mask (Fio2, 21%); these desaturations resolved rapidly without intervention. The weight increased along the 30th percentile.
A diagnostic procedure was performed.",Nodular follicular thyroid neoplasm with a somatic NRAS mutation.
Case 12-2021: A 78-Year-Old Man with a Rash on the Scalp and Face,"Dr. Carolina Chiou (Ophthalmology): A 78-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a rash on the forehead and frontal scalp and edema of the left eyelids.
The patient had been well until 3 days before presentation, when pressurelike pain developed in the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp and the bilateral maxillary sinuses and upper jaws. He described the pain as similar to previous episodes of sinusitis. He was evaluated in the primary care clinic of another hospital, and treatment with oral clindamycin was started for a presumed diagnosis of sinusitis.
Two days before presentation, the patient noted erythema and small reddish-brown skin lesions on the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp. His barber had pointed out a similar spot on the top of his scalp 2 weeks earlier. The skin lesions were not painful or itchy, and he did not seek medical evaluation.
On the day of presentation, the patient awoke from sleep and noted redness and swelling of the left eyelids. The skin lesions on the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp had increased in number, and some were covered with hemorrhagic crust. There was pain with movement of the left eye and blurry vision. Over the course of several hours, the swelling of the left eyelids worsened and the patient was unable to fully open the left eye. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported no ocular or nasal discharge, no changes in taste or hearing, and no jaw claudication. He had not recently changed his shampoo or been in a pool or hot tub. He had a history of recurrent sinus infection, allergic rhinitis, depression, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypogonadism, and restless legs syndrome. He had received a diagnosis of rectal cancer 15 years earlier, which had led to partial colectomy, as well as a diagnosis of testicular cancer 50 years earlier, which had led to orchiectomy and radiation therapy. His ocular history included bilateral mild ptosis; he had undergone bilateral cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation. Medications included finasteride, tamsulosin, carbidopa–levodopa, nasal azelastine and fluticasone, and topical testosterone. Levofloxacin, cefaclor, and sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim had caused a rash. The patient was a retired engineer and lived with his wife in a coastal community of New England. He had previously smoked a pipe but had quit 30 years earlier. He drank a quarter glass of wine daily. His family history included skin cancer in his maternal grandmother and macular degeneration in his sister.
On examination, the temperature was 38.1°C, the blood pressure 122/58 mm Hg, and the heart rate 74 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 31.9. Visual acuity without glasses was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye. Results of Ishihara color testing were normal. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were full. There was complete ptosis of the left upper eyelid, along with erythema and edema of left upper and lower lids. There was mild ptosis of the right upper lid. There was no proptosis. The intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed diffuse conjunctival injection and inferior chemosis in the left eye. The corneas were clear, and no cells were visualized in the anterior chambers. Results of dilated fundoscopic examination were normal. There was prominent erythema affecting the forehead, left side of the anterior scalp, and left eyelids. Multiple coalescing erosions covered with hemorrhagic and serous crust were seen at sites of erythema, mainly affecting the left side of the forehead and extending to the midline, the frontal scalp, and the left upper eyelid. Erosions and erythema affected the right side of the forehead, as well, but to a much lesser extent. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.
Laboratory evaluation revealed a blood sodium level of 125 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). Results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Hillary R. Kelly: Computed tomography (CT) of the head and face (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed marked swelling affecting the soft tissue over the left orbit and frontal sinus and extending superiorly along the superficial soft tissue of the frontal scalp, predominantly on the left side. The globe, orbit, and retrobulbar soft tissue were normal. The right maxillary sinus showed nearly complete opacification with wall thickening and sclerosis, findings consistent with chronic inflammation and sinusitis. There was a defect in the medial wall of the right maxillary sinus that was consistent with previous sinus surgery. The other paranasal sinuses, including the left maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinuses, and sphenoid sinuses, were well aerated.
FIGURE 1

CT of the Head and Face.
Dr. Chiou: Empirical treatment with valacyclovir, amoxicillin–clavulanate, and topical bacitracin–polymyxin B was started. The next day, the edema and erythema of the left eyelids worsened, and there was new edema and erythema of the right eyelids. The patient was unable to open his eyes. He began to have visual hallucinations, and his wife noted that he was confused. The skin lesions on the left side of the forehead were unchanged, and new round punched-out erosions with overlying hemorrhagic crust were present on the right side of the forehead (Figure 2). Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and acyclovir was started.

"Case 11-2021: A 39-Year-Old Woman with Fever, Flank Pain, and Inguinal Lymphadenopathy","Dr. P. Connor Johnson (Medicine): A 39-year-old woman presented to this hospital with fever, flank pain, and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 4 weeks before admission, when she noted tender bilateral inguinal swelling. Two days later, she began to have sharp, intermittent flank pain on the right side; she rated the pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. During the next 3 days, she had nausea and a poor appetite. She noted foul-smelling urine but had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or hematuria.
Three weeks before admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, and she appeared well. There was costovertebral and abdominal tenderness on the right side, without rebound or guarding. The external genitalia were normal. Copious thin, white vaginal discharge was present; no cervical motion tenderness was noted, and the ovaries were normal on palpation. Multiple bilateral tender inguinal lymph nodes, measuring up to 2 cm in diameter, were noted on palpation. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. On microscopic examination of the vaginal discharge, clue cells were observed, but there were no fungal elements or trichomonads. Nucleic acid amplification tests of a cervical swab for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were negative. A blood test for IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies to C. trachomatis serovars L1 and D through K was negative. Urinalysis revealed leukocyte esterase and nitrates; urine was obtained for culture. Vaginal metronidazole gel was prescribed.
Two days later, the urine culture grew more than 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU) of Escherichia coli per milliliter and 10,000 to 100,000 CFU of Klebsiella pneumoniae per milliliter. A 14-day course of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was prescribed.
The inguinal swelling reportedly abated, but the flank pain and nausea persisted. Two days after the patient completed the prescribed course of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, fever and night sweats developed. After 3 days of fever with a temperature of up to 38.5°C, she began vomiting and subsequently presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing flank pain, malaise, nausea, and poor appetite with weight loss of 2.3 kg during the past month. There was no sore throat, cough, or diarrhea. She had a history of hypothyroidism, asthma, bipolar disorder, dysmenorrhea, and migraines. She had had multiple urinary tract infections; pyelonephritis had been diagnosed 4 years before this presentation. A copper intrauterine device had been inserted 6 months before this presentation. Medications included albuterol, budesonide–formoterol, divalproex, levothyroxine, loratadine, and sumatriptan as needed for migraines. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had immigrated to the United States from Brazil 1 year earlier; she had been living in New England during the past year and had been working in a laboratory. She had recently spent 3 months in Brazil visiting her husband and had returned to New England shortly before she noted inguinal swelling. While in Brazil, she had remained in a large city and had not visited any remote locations. In New England, she lived alone with one kitten and one full-grown cat. There was no family history of cancer. An aunt had died from tuberculosis, but the patient had had only minimal contact with her aunt.
On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 100/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 67.5 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.4. The patient appeared ill. The right side of the abdomen was tender on palpation, without rebound or guarding. Hepatosplenomegaly was not present. Tender bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were noted. No palpable cervical, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy was noted. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative, as was an interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Madeleine Sertic: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, with the largest node, on the right side, measuring 2.6 cm in greatest dimension. A right pelvic sidewall lymph node measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension, a gastrohepatic lymph node measuring 0.9 cm in greatest dimension, and lymphadenopathy in the porta hepatis were also seen. Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed an intrauterine device in an appropriate position, normal ovaries, and trace free fluid in the pelvis.

Dr. Johnson: Intravenous fluids and intramuscular ketorolac were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.",Bartonella henselae infection (cat scratch disease).
"Case 10-2021: A 70-Year-Old Man with Depressed Mood, Unsteady Gait, and Urinary Incontinence","Dr. James W. Luccarelli (Psychiatry): A 70-year-old man with bipolar disorder was evaluated at this hospital because of depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and gait disturbance.
The patient had a long history of depressive episodes, with two previous hospitalizations for suicide attempts. Approximately two decades before the current admission, he was struck on the head with a beam while working at a construction site and had a 4-cm laceration. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital, where the wound was sutured but no further evaluation was conducted.
Approximately 10 years before the current admission, around the time of his mother’s death, the patient was evaluated at this hospital because of an episode of irritability, a reduced need for sleep, and grandiosity; he reported feelings of “transcendence” and being “at one with God.” He was admitted for 1 month to the psychiatry unit of a second hospital, where he was treated with lithium and electroconvulsive therapy. Thereafter, he received outpatient psychiatric treatment on a monthly basis, as well as therapy with valproic acid and fluoxetine.
Approximately 9 years before the current admission, the patient fell on concrete stairs and had back pain with subsequent lower-leg weakness and urinary incontinence. He was evaluated at a third hospital, where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes, including L4–L5 spinal stenosis and central disk protrusion. Acetaminophen and physical therapy were prescribed.
Five years later (4 years before the current admission), the patient fell because of an unsteady gait and was evaluated at a fourth hospital. Neurologic examination revealed a memory deficit (with an inability to recall any objects after 5 minutes on the three-item object-recall test) and poor attention (with an inability to perform serial sevens calculations), as well as action tremor in the arms and “mildly unsteady” gait, even with the use of a cane. The remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, results of renal function tests, and levels of electrolytes, valproic acid, folate, vitamin B12, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin were normal; serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. MRI of the head reportedly revealed no evidence of an infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or a mass but showed mild prominence of ventricles, sulci, and cisterns. The dose of fluoxetine was decreased, and the patient was discharged 3 days later.
Additional falls occurred 2 months and 4 months later, and both times, the patient was evaluated at the fourth hospital. Two months after the most recent fall, he hit the car in front of him while driving. His psychiatrist noted that he had bilateral tremor at rest; the dose of valproic acid was reduced, and he was referred to a neurologist. Two months after the car crash, he fell while walking and was evaluated at the fourth hospital. The evaluation was notable for nystagmus and a normal valproic acid level (89 μg per milliliter; reference range, 50 to 100) despite the dose reduction; the doses of valproic acid and trazodone were reduced, and physical therapy was provided. During the next 5 months, gait instability was reduced but persisted. The patient was evaluated by two other neurologists after reporting a feeling of “imbalance.” Audiometry revealed mild-to-moderate high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Medications were considered to be a contributor to his balance dysfunction.
During the next 12 months, the dose of valproic acid was tapered and fluoxetine was stopped; the patient underwent trials of escitalopram and then sertraline for the treatment of depressive symptoms. He reported to his psychiatrist symptoms of confusion, some difficulty with memory, and decreased leg coordination. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 23 (scores range from 0 to 30, with a score of 18 to 25 suggesting mild cognitive impairment).
Dr. McKinley Glover: Fifteen months before the current admission, the patient began to have dizziness. MRI of the head (Figure 1), performed at this hospital, revealed an old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss, and mild ventricular prominence.
FIGURE 1

Initial MRI of the Head.
Dr. Luccarelli: Neuropsychiatric testing was performed, and the results did not suggest a neurodegenerative process. Given the patient’s progressively depressed mood, treatment with aripiprazole was started, with the dose adjusted over the following 12 months.
Three months before the current admission, the patient reported worsening depression, with hopelessness, guilt, and increased sleep. That month, his son found him unable to walk and requiring assistance to move. On examination, he had tremor and muscle rigidity; on ambulation, he had a shuffling gait and required a cane. Treatment with aripiprazole was stopped, benztropine was started, and sertraline was replaced by fluoxetine.
One month before the current admission, the patient was voluntarily hospitalized in the psychiatry unit of this hospital because of worsening depression, which he attributed to the progressive reduction in mobility and strength. He reported 3 weeks of frequent early morning awakenings, anhedonia, low energy, anorexia, difficulty concentrating, and low motivation, such that he had not paid bills or bathed. Examination was notable for tremor, muscle rigidity, and a shuffling gait. Blood levels of folate, vitamin B12, and glycated hemoglobin were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 antibodies and type 1 antigen and for antitreponemal antibodies were negative. Over the 5-day hospitalization, the dose of fluoxetine was increased and treatment with lurasidone was started.

During the following 4 weeks, the patient’s ability to walk continued to deteriorate, and he required intermittent use of a walker and a wheelchair. His depressive symptoms persisted, and after he reported thoughts of suicide and feeling unsafe to his psychiatrist, he was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for malaise, anorexia, poor sleep, anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt, low energy, worsening gait, and chronic joint pain; he reported no recent falls or manic symptoms.
The patient’s psychiatric history included bipolar depression with suicide attempts and multiple psychiatric admissions, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and skin picking. His medical history was notable for long-standing urinary incontinence, hypertension, and sleep apnea; he had undergone laser ablation of the prostate 4 years earlier, as well as bilateral inguinal hernia repair and rotator cuff repair. Medications at the time of admission included fluoxetine, lurasidone, valproic acid, aspirin, and lisinopril, as well as lorazepam and trazodone as needed. Lithium had caused tremor, aripiprazole had caused muscle rigidity and tremor, and gabapentin had caused grogginess. The patient did not smoke tobacco, and he drank alcohol less than once monthly; he had previously smoked marijuana several times daily but had been abstinent for 2 years. He was retired from employment as a laborer. He was divorced and resided in an assisted-living facility. His family history was notable for major depression in his mother and bipolar disorder in one of his children.
The temperature was 36.1°C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/61 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.5. The patient was wheelchair-bound. He was described as well-groomed and cooperative, with appropriate eye contact. He was oriented to time, place, and person. His speech was fluent and indicated a logical thought process but was considered to be “slow.” Some of his responses seemed slow, but naming, repetition, attention, concentration, and memory were intact. His mood and affect were described as depressed, and he had suicidal ideation. Results of cranial nerve examination were normal, except for reduced facial expression. Motor examination showed mildly increased tone in the lower legs and left arm, with bradykinesia, and was otherwise normal. The gait was described as being “slow to start” with a “magnetic quality” and then as “shuffling” for a few steps. The remainder of the neurologic and general physical examinations was normal.
The white-cell count, platelet count, and levels of hemoglobin, calcium, and albumin were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Glover: MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed the old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, and mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss with prominence of the ventricles and sylvian fissures. There was no abnormal enhancement. Coronal reformatted images showed a callosal angle (the angle at which the two lateral ventricles meet at the level of the posterior commissure) of 66 degrees.

"Case 9-2021: A 16-Year-Old Boy with Headache, Abdominal Pain, and Hypertension","Dr. Neil D. Fernandes (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
The patient had been well until 17 months before this admission, when he began to have episodes of headache and neck pain multiple times per week after an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) accident. Two months later, the patient collided with another adolescent while he was playing soccer, and the episodes of headache and neck pain worsened. He rated the pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain.
Fifteen months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the pediatric clinic of another hospital. On examination, the pulse was 95 beats per minute and the blood pressure 117/78 mm Hg. There was mild tenderness in the area of the trapezius muscle. A radiograph of the cervical spine was normal. During the next 15 months, the patient was followed in the pediatric and neurology clinics of the other hospital. Ibuprofen, nortriptyline, sumatriptan, cyclobenzaprine, and diazepam were prescribed, but the headache did not abate. He underwent physical therapy, chiropractic adjustment, massage therapy, and acupuncture, but the symptoms persisted.
Three months before this admission, nausea began to occur during the episodes of headache. The pain became more intense when the patient was lying down or was physically active, resulting in tunnel vision and vomiting; after he vomited, the pain became less intense. He was evaluated at the pediatric clinic of the other hospital. On examination, the pulse was 104 beats per minute and the blood pressure 128/80 mm Hg. At the recommendation of his physicians, the patient stopped participating in all sports.
Two days before this admission, the pain worsened and awoke the patient from sleep. The nausea was constant, and the vomiting occurred two times per day. The patient was unable to attend school because of the symptoms. His parents took him to the pediatric clinic of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 115 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 120/64 mm Hg. The height was 183.6 cm, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.0. The physical examination was normal. A probable diagnosis of mixed migraines and tension headaches was made. Prednisone, zolmitriptan, and ondansetron were prescribed, and the patient was sent home.
On the day of this admission, the patient had new severe pain on the right side of the abdomen that awoke him from sleep. The headache, neck pain, and nausea were constant. The patient was taken to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the blood pressure 239/162 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The white-cell count was 22,380 per microliter (reference range at other hospital, 3800 to 10,500), the lactic acid level 2.7 mmol per liter (24 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]), and the creatinine level 1.3 mg per deciliter (115 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [53 to 115 μmol per liter]). An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with increased R-wave and S-wave amplitudes in the precordial leads, as well as nonspecific repolarization abnormalities. One hour later, a repeat ECG showed an ectopic atrial rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions at a rate of 66 beats per minute.
Intravenous hydromorphone, morphine, ondansetron, metoclopramide, and lactated Ringer’s solution were administered. A nitroglycerin infusion was started, and the systolic blood pressure decreased to 143 mm Hg; the infusion was stopped, and the systolic blood pressure increased to 212 mm Hg. Intravenous labetalol was administered, and the systolic blood pressure decreased to 92 mm Hg. An esmolol infusion was started, and the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital, arriving 3 hours after presentation to the other hospital. Shortly after his arrival, the esmolol infusion was stopped.
On admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had played paintball a few days earlier but did not recall any direct trauma to the chest or abdomen. A review of systems was notable for heat intolerance and night sweats. He had a history of acne and had received a diagnosis of pneumonia involving the right upper lobe 10 months before this admission. He had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccines. His medications included doxycycline and topical tretinoin, clindamycin, and benzoyl peroxide, in addition to zolmitriptan and ondansetron; he had not started taking the recently prescribed prednisone. There were no known drug allergies.
The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents and younger brother. He performed well in high school. Before the recent progression of his symptoms, he had participated in soccer, basketball, and track. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He drank one or two alcoholic beverages per month. His father and paternal grandparents had hypertension, and his maternal aunts had migraines; his mother and brother were healthy.
On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the pulse 126 beats per minute, the blood pressure 90/44 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He appeared tired, pale, and diaphoretic. He was in distress because of the pain; he spoke in brief sentences and had frequent hiccups. The abdomen was nondistended with marked tenderness in the right upper quadrant and right flank, with rebound and guarding. The skin was warm and clammy, and some inguinal hyperpigmentation was present. No café au lait spots were noted.
The white-cell count was 27,140 per microliter (reference range at this hospital, 4500 to 13,000), the lactic acid level 3.4 mmol per liter (31 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]), the creatinine level 1.64 mg per deciliter (145 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]), and the high-sensitivity troponin T level 188 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On hospital day 2, urinalysis revealed 1+ blood, trace ketones, a pH of 5.0, and a specific gravity of 1.015; microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed squamous cells, crystals, and mucin, as well as 3 to 5 hyaline casts per high-power field, less than 10 white cells per high-power field, and no red cells.

A diagnosis was made.",Pheochromocytoma.
Case 8-2021: A 34-Year-Old Woman with Cholangiocarcinoma,"Dr. Christopher T. Chen: A 34-year-old woman was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital for the management of relapsed, metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
The patient had been well until 3 years before this evaluation, when acute abdominal and back pain developed, and she presented to the emergency department of another hospital. As part of the evaluation, abdominal ultrasonography was performed and reportedly revealed a lesion in the right lobe of the liver. Additional imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Theodore T. Pierce: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a heterogeneous, hypoenhancing, lobulated lesion that measured 6.1 cm by 4.5 cm (Figure 1A), with imaging characteristics suggestive of primary or metastatic cancer. The lesion was associated with peripheral biliary dilatation, which suggested biliary obstruction (Figure 1B); restricted diffusion, indicating high tissue density (Figure 1C); peripheral rim enhancement on arterial phase imaging, reflecting increased vascularity at the rim of the lesion (Figure 1D); and delayed enhancement of the more central areas of the lesion, indicating fibrosis (Figure 1E and 1F). Taken together, these features are atypical of benign lesions, such as hemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatic adenoma, and are most consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.
FIGURE 1

Initial MRI of the Liver.
Positron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT), performed after the administration of intravenous 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed FDG avidity in the hepatic mass in the right lobe. No additional sites of hypermetabolism were noted.
Dr. Chen: Given the concern for cancer, blood samples were obtained for testing for tumor markers. The level of CA 19-9 was elevated, at 110 IU per milliliter (reference value, <35), but the levels of alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal. An ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy of the liver mass in the right lobe was performed, and management decisions were made.",Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
"Case 7-2021: A 19-Year-Old Man with Shock, Multiple Organ Failure, and Rash","Dr. Alexandra T. Lucas (Pediatrics): A 19-year-old man was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital because of shock, multiple organ failure, and rash.
The patient had been well until 20 hours before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed after he ate rice, chicken, and lo mein leftovers from a restaurant meal. Multiple episodes of emesis occurred, with vomitus that was either bilious or red-brown. The abdominal pain and vomiting were followed by the development of chills, generalized weakness, progressively worsening diffuse myalgias, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, neck stiffness, and blurry vision. Five hours before this admission, purplish discoloration of the skin developed, and a friend took the patient to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.
On arrival at the emergency department of the other hospital, 4.5 hours before this admission, the patient reported diffuse myalgias that he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, he appeared pale, anxious, and moderately distressed; he answered questions appropriately and was oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The temperature was 37.4°C, the pulse 147 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/124 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The oral mucous membranes were dry. On auscultation of the heart, tachycardia was present with a regular rhythm. The radial pulses were normal. The lungs were clear, without crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, without tenderness; the patient vomited yellow-green material during the examination. The skin was warm and dry and had a mottled appearance.
Blood specimens were obtained and sent to the laboratory for culture, a complete blood count, and tests of renal function, liver function, and coagulation, as well as measurement of levels of electrolytes, glucose, lipase, lactic acid, and troponin. A urine specimen was sent for urinalysis and culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for influenza virus nucleic acid testing. Approximately 40 minutes after the patient’s arrival at the other hospital, ondansetron, ceftriaxone, and a 2-liter bolus of 0.90% normal saline were administered intravenously.
During the next 30 minutes, tachypnea worsened and labored breathing, hypoxemia, and cyanosis developed. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask, resulting in an oxygen saturation of 83%; then, oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 40 liters per minute. Intravenous doses of dexamethasone and vancomycin were given.
During the following 40 minutes, the systolic blood pressure fell to 70 mm Hg and the dorsalis pedis pulses were noted to be weak. Approximately 110 minutes after the patient’s arrival at the other hospital, a triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed in the right femoral vein and a continuous intravenous infusion of norepinephrine was initiated. After intravenous doses of midazolam, etomidate, and fentanyl were administered, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation with pressure-regulated volume control was begun, with a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of body weight, a rate of 24 breaths per minute, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm of water, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of 100%. A continuous infusion of propofol was begun.
Hypotension persisted, and a diffuse purpuric rash developed. Approximately 2 hours after the patient’s arrival at the other hospital, a dose of piperacillin–tazobactam was administered, a 1-liter bolus of 0.45% normal saline with 150 meq of sodium bicarbonate was given, and a Foley catheter was inserted. Twenty minutes later, a continuous intravenous infusion of phenylephrine was added, followed 7 minutes later by a vasopressin infusion. The patient was transported by helicopter to the PICU of this hospital.
On the patient’s admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained from family members. A friend who had eaten the same meal as the patient the evening before admission had vomited once shortly thereafter but had not become progressively ill. The patient had a history of anxiety and depression, as well as intermittent ear infections during childhood. He had no known drug allergies. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. He smoked two packs of cigarettes weekly, smoked marijuana daily, and drank two alcoholic beverages approximately 2 times per week. He used dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine recreationally but did not use other illicit drugs.
The patient lived in northern New England with his mother, brother, and three cats but had been staying with a friend for 5 days before admission, during which time he had visited a beach along the ocean and a music venue. He worked part-time at a restaurant; he had not traveled recently or had any other exposure to animals or ill persons. His father had coronary artery disease, his mother had hypothyroidism, and his brother had had viral meningitis at 6 weeks of age.
On examination, the patient was pharmacologically sedated. The temperature was 40.8°C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/53 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was receiving mechanical ventilation with an Fio2 of 50%. He opened his eyes occasionally. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The femoral pulses were palpable, but the peripheral pulses were not palpable and the digits were cold. There was diffuse anasarca and oozing from venipuncture sites and from the site of central venous catheter insertion. A diffuse reticular purpuric rash was present on the face, chest, abdomen, back, arms, and legs, sparing the palms and soles (Fig. 1). A Foley catheter was in place, without urine output. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed perihilar airspace and diffuse interstitial opacities and bilateral small, layering pleural effusions.

Dr. Manuella Lahoud-Rahme: A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained while the patient was receiving norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vasopressin. The left ventricle had moderate dysfunction with regional wall-motion abnormalities; septal motion was decreased, but apical motion appeared to be preserved. The right ventricle had mild-to-moderate dysfunction with underfilling. There was no pericardial effusion.
Dr. Lucas: Approximately 7 hours after admission to this hospital, a diagnostic test result was received and additional management decisions were made.",Meningococcal purpura fulminans.
Case 6-2021: A 65-Year-Old Man with Eye Pain and Decreased Vision,"Dr. Bart K. Chwalisz: A 65-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of bilateral eye pain and decreased vision.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 days before this admission, when constant aching pain developed in the left eye and the left side of the head. During the next few days, the vision in the left eye gradually became blurry. Three days before this admission, redness developed in the right eye. The patient used tetrahydrozoline eye drops, but symptoms did not abate. One day before this admission, pain developed in the right eye that was similar to the pain in the left eye. The patient sought evaluation by his primary care physician, who recommended that he present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
On arrival, the patient rated the eye pain and headache at 2 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain was not worse with eye movement or accompanied by flashing lights, floaters, or discharge. The patient reported no trauma but noted weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past 2 weeks, as well as pain with chewing food. He did not have scalp tenderness, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, numbness, weakness, or slurred speech.
The patient had a history of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, which had been diagnosed 2 years before this admission and treated with plasmapheresis, dexamethasone, and four cycles of bortezomib (with discontinuation of bortezomib after 4 months because of peripheral neuropathy), as well as six cycles of bendamustine. During the 9 months that followed the completion of treatment with bendamustine, there was active surveillance of the blood IgM level. One month before this admission, the IgM level was 1001 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334), and biopsy of the bone marrow revealed persistent disease. One week before this admission, the patient took his first dose of ibrutinib, which had been prescribed 3 months earlier.
Other medical history included latent tuberculosis, depression, anxiety, prediabetes, folate deficiency, and seasonal allergies. Medications included ibrutinib, isoniazid, pyridoxine, sertraline, citalopram, hydroxyzine, cetirizine, fluticasone nasal spray, and a multivitamin. Rituximab had caused anaphylaxis. The patient did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. He was originally from Central America and had immigrated to the United States 50 years earlier; 1 month earlier, he had moved from the West Coast to an urban area of New England. He lived in an apartment with his niece and cousins and worked in construction. His family history was unknown.
On examination, the temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 104/69 mm Hg, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye with correction. On confrontation testing, visual fields in the left eye were deficient in the inferior temporal and nasal aspects. On the Ishihara color test, all plates were identified with the right eye but only the control plate was identified with the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the left eye. There was no proptosis. Subconjunctival hemorrhage was present in the right eye; pterygia were present in both eyes. On funduscopic examination, the optic disk in the left eye was edematous. Results of tests of cranial nerve function, power, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait were normal.
The blood hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), the hematocrit 39.8% (reference range, 41.0 to 53.0), the white-cell count 8090 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), and the platelet count 131,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The IgM level was 540 mg per deciliter; the level of IgM kappa M component in the gamma region was 0.36 g per deciliter. Blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney and liver function. Tests for Lyme disease, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, and bartonellosis were negative. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. Javier M. Romero: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild thickening and perineural enhancement along the entire length of the left optic nerve (Figure 1A and 1B). There was a deformity of the left lamina papyracea with medial deviation of the medial and superior rectus muscle, as well as postoperative changes in the sinuses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits, performed with and without the administration of contrast material, was limited by artifact but revealed increased signal intensity and possible focal enhancement within the retrobulbar segment of the left optic nerve (Figure 1C and 1D).

Dr. Chwalisz: The patient was admitted to this hospital, and a diagnosis was made.",Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma of the central nervous system (Bing–Neel syndrome).
Case 5-2021: A 68-Year-Old Man with Delirium and Renal Insufficiency,"Dr. Mark A. Matza (Medicine): A 68-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of neurologic decline, progressive renal insufficiency, and leukopenia.
Seven months before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital after routine laboratory testing had identified abnormalities, including a creatinine level of 3.2 mg per deciliter (283 mmol per liter; reference range, 0.50 to 1.40 mg per deciliter [44 to 124 mmol per liter]), a blood urea nitrogen level of 54 mg per deciliter (19 mmol per liter; reference range, 7 to 30 mg per deciliter [2.5 to 11 mmol per liter]), and a calcium level of 12.1 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.8 to 10.6 mg per deciliter [2.2 to 2.6 mmol per liter]). Twelve months earlier, the creatinine level had been 1.7 mg per deciliter (150 mmol per liter). On admission to the other hospital, he reported unintentional weight loss of 14 kg over the preceding 12 months, malaise, waking every 2 hours to empty his bladder, and new mild exertional dyspnea. The temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 117/74 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 68 kg and the body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 23.5. Examination was notable for cachexia and hepatosplenomegaly (with the liver and spleen palpable 6 cm below the costal margin) without lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. Blood levels of magnesium, bilirubin, globulin, creatine kinase, uric acid, and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal; urine protein electrophoresis revealed polyclonal light-chain bands.

Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed focal nodular soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta. Splenomegaly and left paraaortic adenopathy were present. Small pulmonary nodules and patchy consolidation were observed, along with a small left pleural effusion.
Dr. Matza: After treatment with intravenous normal saline and furosemide, the calcium level normalized and the creatinine level decreased to 2.3 mg per deciliter (203 mmol per liter). The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day.
Dr. Rory K. Crotty: A bone marrow biopsy performed 2 weeks later at the first hospital revealed hypercellular marrow and multiple nonnecrotizing granulomas. Staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungi was negative. No cultures were obtained.
Dr. Matza: The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 89 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 67). A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered, and therapy with high-dose oral prednisone was started.
One month later, the ACE level decreased to 41 U per liter, and the patient’s energy level and appetite improved. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone were unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea.
Three months later, the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the first hospital for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was initiated for prophylaxis against pneumocystis while the patient continued to receive high-dose prednisone. Tests of pulmonary function showed mild obstruction, with a clinically significant response after the use of a bronchodilator, and moderate restriction, with moderately reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. A second attempt to taper the dose of prednisone was unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea.
During the next 2 months, intermittent confusion, progressive weakness in the legs, right foot drop, and increasing unsteadiness and gait instability developed; the patient began to use a walker to ambulate. He also had at least two falls. He required help from his wife to perform activities of daily living, including bathing and dressing.
The patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at the first hospital. Complement levels were normal, as was the level of rheumatoid factor. Tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Weekly treatment with oral methotrexate and folic acid was started for presumed sarcoidosis.
Eleven days later, the patient presented to a second hospital with a new facial droop on the left side, slurred speech, and confusion. The temperature was 36.4°C, the heart rate 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/86 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 63 kg and the BMI 21.9. The patient was oriented to person, place, and time; neurologic examination was notable for a mild facial droop on the left side, mildly increased muscle tone, right foot drop, and symmetric mild weakness in the arms and upper legs. Cachexia, tachycardia, and splenomegaly were noted. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a 12-mm right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm, a right cerebellar cavernous malformation, and numerous punctate foci (in the pons, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus) characterized by hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging and restricted diffusion.
Dr. Matza: Clopidogrel and levetiracetam were initiated. Echocardiography did not show intracardiac thrombus or shunting; carotid ultrasonography did not show stenosis. Electromyography revealed evidence of mild L5–S1 radiculopathy and right ulnar and median neuropathy, but there was no evidence of myopathy or upper motor neuron disease. Owing to progressive leukopenia (white-cell count, 1390 per microliter) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 51,000 per microliter), methotrexate, clopidogrel, levetiracetam, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole were discontinued; cyanocobalamin was started.
On the fourth hospital day, a fever with a temperature of 38.3°C developed; specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were initiated. The C-reactive protein level was 101.8 mg per liter. Blood tests for ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid factor, influenza type A and B antigens, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen, antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core antibodies, cytomegalovirus DNA, Epstein–Barr virus DNA, and parvovirus IgM were negative, as were urine tests for legionella antigen and histoplasma antigen. A rapid plasma reagin test was negative, and an interferon-γ release assay for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was reported as indeterminate.
Dr. Shepard: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed scattered ground-glass opacities in the lungs, nodular and consolidative opacities in the lungs, mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, small pleural effusions, and splenomegaly (with the spleen measuring 16 cm in the cephalocaudad dimension; normal length, <13 cm). Focal soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta and prominence of the soft tissue surrounding the infrarenal abdominal aorta were also noted.
The next day, magnetic resonance angiography was performed. A T2-weighted fat-saturated image (Figure 1A) showed signal hyperintensity in the soft tissue around the infrarenal aorta and in the adjacent left paraaortic lymph nodes that was indicative of adenopathy, with a focal abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm seen on time-of-flight imaging (Figure 1B).
FIGURE 1

Initial Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Chest.
Dr. Matza: On the eighth hospital day, a bone marrow biopsy was performed. On the ninth day, the patient was transferred to this hospital.
On the patient’s arrival, a review of systems was limited owing to delirium, and history was obtained in part from the patient’s family. The review was notable for months of fatigue, malaise, leg weakness, right foot drop, waxing and waning confusion, exertional dyspnea, and an inability to walk and perform activities of daily living. Palpitations, dry cough, easy bruising, and irritable bladder were present, but he had no chills, anorexia, joint pain, erythema, rashes, nodules, myalgia, chest pain, dizziness, productive cough, hemoptysis, orthopnea, wheezing, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysuria, hematuria, ocular or nasal symptoms, skin or nail changes, or headache.
The patient’s medical history was notable for hypothyroidism, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, progressive kidney disease, degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, scoliosis, tubular adenoma, and leukopenia. Eight years before this admission, a mass in the bladder that measured 4.5 cm by 4.0 cm was noted on ultrasonography, which had been performed for evaluation of hematuria. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed at another hospital, but the resection was reportedly incomplete. Histologic examination revealed non–muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma. Repeat cystoscopy and transurethral resection, performed 3, 8, and 16 months after the initial procedures, each revealed fragments of non–muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, and intravesical bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) was administered. Cystoscopy, performed 1 year before this admission for the management of bladder stones, identified a recurrent polypoid bladder tumor, which was treated with transurethral resection.
Outpatient medications included prednisone, methotrexate, folic acid, aspirin, levothyroxine, simvastatin, tamsulosin, cholecalciferol, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, omeprazole, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, fluticasone–salmeterol, and as-needed inhaled albuterol. Penicillin had caused an unknown reaction.
The patient was a retired pharmacist and lived with his wife. He had a remote history of smoking a half pack of cigarettes daily for 2 years and drank alcohol infrequently. He had not traveled recently and had had no environmental, animal, or toxic exposures. There was no family history of autoimmune, neurologic, infectious, or pulmonary disorders.
The temperature was 36.8°C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/76 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 54 kg and the BMI 18.8. He was anxious, cachectic, and appeared chronically ill. He correctly reported his name, location, and the time and date; however, he was unable to follow simple two-step commands. The cranial-nerve examination revealed a subtle facial droop on the left side. There were tremors in the arms and legs at rest and with motion, as well as right foot drop and diffusely increased tone. Finger–nose–finger testing showed dysmetria. Bibasilar crackles (greater in the left lung than in the right) were heard on lung auscultation. Hepatosplenomegaly was present. There were diffuse ecchymoses on the trunk, arms, and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal.
The international normalized ratio and blood levels of ammonia, bilirubin, creatine kinase, folic acid, globulin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, lactic acid, and magnesium were normal. The ACE level was 36 U per liter (reference range, 8 to 53). Serum protein electrophoresis showed no bands, but a mild, diffuse decrease in globulin was noted. The urine free kappa light-chain level was 134.2 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.4 to 15.1), and the urine free lambda light-chain level was 35.6 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.8 to 10.1), with a normal ratio (3.77; reference range, 0.50 to 4.00). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. During the first 3 days of this admission, the patient became lethargic; when he was awakened, his speech was incoherent and dysarthric.
Dr. Schaefer: On the third hospital day, MRI of the head (Figure 2) with magnetic resonance angiography revealed a stable right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm, as well as a stable right cerebellar cavernous malformation. There were punctate and patchy foci characterized by hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging and restricted diffusion in the midbrain, pons, medulla, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus; the foci had increased in size and extent from the previous study.
FIGURE 2

MRI of the Head.
Dr. Shepard: Positron-emission tomography (PET)–CT (Figure 1D through 1F) revealed multiple foci of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in periaortic soft tissue and paraaortic lymph nodes, in the axial skeleton (cervical vertebral body, ribs, manubrium, and sacrum), and in the left testis.
Dr. Matza: Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, 1,3-β-d-glucan, coxiella antibodies, cytomegalovirus IgM and IgG, cryptococcal antigen, human chorionic gonadotropin, and Treponema pallidum antibodies were negative, as was a urine test for histoplasma antigen. Electroencephalographic monitoring showed frequent sharp, irregular delta and theta discharges; treatment with levetiracetam was started.
On the fourth hospital day, the temperature was 38.3°C. Ultrasound images showed testes of normal size and echotexture without focal lesions, but the epididymides were enlarged and heterogeneous. The kidneys were normal in size, with diffusely echogenic parenchyma, and a 19-mm bladder stone was present. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function, no evidence of clinically significant valvular disease, and a mildly dilated aorta. Flow cytometry showed a markedly reduced CD4+ T-cell count (11 per microliter; reference range, 348 to 1456). Antibody tests for bartonella and brucella were negative.
Somnolence progressed, and on the fifth hospital day, the right pupil was noted to be slightly larger than the left and the patient had increased tremor. Fosphenytoin therapy was initiated, and he was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit. The oxygen saturation declined to 90% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute, and a Cheyne–Stokes pattern of respiration was observed. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated.
A diagnosis was made.",Disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection.
Case 4-2021: A 70-Year-Old Woman with Dyspnea on Exertion and Abnormal Findings on Chest Imaging,"Dr. Benjamin D. Medoff: A 70-year-old woman was evaluated at the pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of increasing dyspnea on exertion and abnormal findings on chest imaging.
In childhood, the patient had eczema, recurrent episodes of bronchitis with a cough productive of mucus, and allergic rhinitis; these conditions abated in adulthood. Twenty years before this evaluation, she had community-acquired pneumonia. Fifteen years before this evaluation, she had an inhalation exposure to aerosolized brick and mortar at a construction site near her home; she subsequently had bronchitis that was treated with a course of nebulizers and inhaled glucocorticoids.
Twelve years before this evaluation, the patient began to have episodes of coryza, nasal congestion, itchy and watery eyes, and wheezing, especially in the spring or with exposure to cats, dogs, or dust. She was seen by an allergist. Skin-prick testing elicited a response to dust mites, and intradermal testing elicited a response to tree mix and dog dander. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Presumptive diagnoses of asthma and seasonal and environmental allergies were made. She received prescriptions for fexofenadine, mometasone, and inhaled albuterol, to be taken as needed.

Eleven years before this evaluation, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen incidentally revealed mild mosaic attenuation — a patchy ground-glass pattern — at the lung bases. Ten years before this evaluation, the patient was seen by her primary care physician because of several weeks of nonproductive cough, nasal congestion, and intermittent wheezing; she received prescriptions for oral loratadine and inhaled pirbuterol, to be taken as needed. Eight years before this evaluation, she was referred to an allergist. She was considered to have a cough in response to angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors. Six years 3 months before this evaluation, she consulted with another allergist. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. The blood IgE level was 1532 kU per liter (reference range at other institution, <127), with positive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, and dust mites. Inhaled fluticasone was prescribed. Three months later, she had mild dyspnea on exertion and occasional wheezing. Pulmonary-function tests showed minimal change (Table 1); inhaled fluticasone–salmeterol was prescribed.
Five years 9 months before this evaluation, the patient was referred for pulmonary consultation. She reported intermittent wheezing, mild exertional dyspnea after climbing two flights of stairs or carrying groceries, occasional gastroesophageal reflux, and snoring. The heart rate was 72 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while she was breathing ambient air at rest. Examination revealed upper-airway wheezing and was otherwise normal. After the patient climbed four flights of stairs, the heart rate was 102 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while she was breathing ambient air. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hemoglobin were normal, as was the platelet count; the white-cell count was 11,900 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000) and the eosinophil count was 390 per microliter (reference range, <600), with a relative eosinophil count of 3.2% (reference range, 0 to 3). Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels were undetectable.
Dr. Amita Sharma: Chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation, as well as several lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis.
Dr. Medoff: The patient was seen by an otolaryngologist. External and fiberoptic examinations, including examination of the vocal cords, were normal. A sleep study revealed mild sleep apnea, with an apnea–hypopnea index of 7.2 events per hour (reference range, <5). The patient was unable to receive supplemental oxygen at night and positive-pressure ventilation owing to side effects.
Five years before this evaluation, the patient underwent cardiac evaluation because of ongoing dyspnea on exertion. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Results of an exercise stress test (treadmill test) were submaximal, with a maximum heart rate at 74% of the age-predicted value but without abnormal findings on electrocardiography. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Three months later, the patient attended follow-up with her pulmonologist; inhaled budesonide–formoterol was substituted for inhaled fluticasone–salmeterol, and weight loss was advised.
Dr. Sharma: Four years before this evaluation, repeat chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. All the findings were stable from the previous CT scan.
Dr. Medoff: The patient was seen by a second pulmonologist, and inhaled budesonide was substituted for inhaled budesonide–formoterol for the treatment of mild intermittent asthma. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 4 years before this evaluation are shown in Table 1. Subsequently, the patient was evaluated annually by her first pulmonologist, but after 3 years, she consulted with a third pulmonologist regarding recurrent dyspnea on exertion. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 7 months before this evaluation are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Sharma: At that time, chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and a nodule measuring 6 mm in diameter in the posterior right upper lobe, along with other, diffuse lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter.
Dr. Medoff: The blood hemoglobin level, platelet count, and white-cell count were normal; the eosinophil count was 437 per microliter, with a relative eosinophil count of 4.9%. The ANA titer was 1:1280, with a homogeneous staining pattern. The IgE level was 2685 kU per liter (reference range at other institution, <114), with positive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, dust mites, and Cladosporium herbarum. Treatment with oral montelukast and inhaled fluticasone–umeclidinium–vilanterol was started, along with supplemental oxygen to be used at night and with exertion. After 1 month, the patient’s symptoms had not abated, and subcutaneous benralizumab was prescribed.
Three months before this evaluation, the patient’s symptoms remained unchanged. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. One month later, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)–positron-emission tomography and CT revealed no areas of abnormal FDG avidity in the lungs. Eight weeks later, the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital.
The patient reported intermittent wheezing and progressive mild exertional dyspnea after climbing one to two flights of stairs. She had stopped playing a team aerobic sport because of difficulty breathing. The symptoms did not abate with use of the inhaler or benralizumab; they never occurred at rest. She occasionally had a nonproductive cough without hemoptysis, and she had a “raspy” voice that had become worse in recent months. Coryza, nasal congestion, and watery eyes were not present. She had gained 15 kg during the previous 5 years.
The patient’s medical history included eczema, hypothyroidism, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, borderline diabetes, calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, glaucoma, and colonic polyps. She had undergone tonsillectomy and multiple procedures for the treatment of nephrolithiasis, including shock-wave lithotripsy and ureteroscopy.
Medications included oral aspirin, amlodipine, atenolol, atorvastatin, atovaquone, levothyroxine, loratadine, losartan, and montelukast, along with a multivitamin; inhaled fluticasone–umeclidinium–vilanterol; and subcutaneous benralizumab. Sulfa drugs had caused anaphylaxis, lisinopril had caused a cough, and macrolides had caused diarrhea.
The patient worked as an educator. She had no known exposure to asbestos, mold, solvents, or chemicals. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not have secondhand exposure to tobacco; she drank one glass of wine per week and did not use illicit drugs. She had traveled to coastal areas of Florida and Massachusetts, as well as other areas of New England, but she had not traveled to other areas of the United States or outside the country. The patient was married and lived in Massachusetts with her spouse. There had been no pets in her home for approximately 10 years. There were no damp areas in her home; she used a vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter and allergen-proof bedsheets.
The patient’s family history was notable for coronary artery and peripheral artery disease in her father, a sister, and her brother; skin cancer in her mother; breast cancer in a sister; and hypertension and diabetes in multiple relatives. She had two healthy adult children. There was no history of allergic, immunologic, pulmonary, or rheumatologic disease.
The temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 67 beats per minute, the blood pressure 142/91 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air. After she climbed two flights of stairs, the oxygen saturation was 87% while she was breathing ambient air. She had a cushingoid appearance. The nasal and oral mucosa appeared normal. There was no tracheal deviation or stridor. Lung auscultation revealed normal breath sounds. There was no clubbing or edema. Mild scattered eczematous plaques were present on the forearms and shins. There were mild Heberden’s nodes but no other joint, skin, or nail abnormalities. The remainder of the examination was normal.
The blood hemoglobin level, white-cell count, differential count (with 0% eosinophils), platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and creatine kinase level were normal. The IgE level was 1307 IU per milliliter (reference range at this hospital, 0 to 100), and a hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel was negative. The thyrotropin level was 8.07 μIU per milliliter (reference range, 0.40 to 5.00), and the aldolase level 9.3 U per liter (reference range, <7.7). The ANA titer was 1:5120, with a homogeneous and speckled staining pattern; the anticytoplasmic antibody titer was 1:1280, with a filamentous and granular staining pattern; and ANCA testing was negative. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal.
Ten weeks after evaluation, at follow-up in the pulmonary clinic, a myositis antibody panel was negative, except for a weakly positive titer in response to anti-Ku antibodies. Tests were negative for ANCA, anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide, rheumatoid factor, and anti–double-stranded DNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Smith, antiribonucleoprotein, antitopoisomerase I (anti–Scl-70), antimitochondrial, antithyroperoxidase, and anti–histidyl–transfer RNA synthase (anti–Jo-1) antibodies.
Dr. Sharma: Chest CT (Figure 1A and 1B), performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed diffuse bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules, including a 6-mm nodule in the right upper lobe. There was no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, or lymphadenopathy.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies of the Chest.
Dr. Medoff: Five days later, the patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at this hospital. A tapering course of oral prednisone was prescribed for the treatment of possible interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features.
Ten weeks after the visit with the rheumatologist, the eczematous rash had improved but dyspnea on exertion persisted during long walks. An examination in the pulmonary clinic was notable for clear lung fields and an oxygen saturation of 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Sharma: Chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, again showed extensive bilateral mosaic attenuation and numerous bilateral solid lung nodules, with the largest nodule, measuring 6 mm in diameter, located in the right upper lobe. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis or reticulation. Expiratory CT (Figure 1C and 1D) confirmed the presence of air trapping.
Diagnostic tests were performed.",Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia.
Case 3-2021: A 48-Year-Old Man with Transient Vision Loss,"Dr. Naomi J. Serling-Boyd (Medicine): A 48-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of transient vision loss.
The patient had been in his usual state of good health until 1 hour before evaluation, when he noticed white “sparkles” flickering in the vision of the left eye, followed by sudden blurriness. He had no floaters or eye pain. During the next 2 minutes, the blurry vision worsened and became “dark,” such that the patient could not see a hand in front of his face when he covered the right eye. He presented to this hospital for evaluation, arriving 1 hour after the onset of vision symptoms.
On presentation, the patient noted that the vision in the left eye was improving but remained blurry. The temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.2. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and was limited to hand motions at 0.9 m (3.0 ft) in the left eye; 2 hours later, visual acuity in the left eye was 20/40 for distance vision and 20/30 with correction for near vision. Results of the Ishihara color test were normal. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were intact; visual fields were full in response to confrontation. Intraocular pressure and results of a slit-lamp examination of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye were normal bilaterally. There was severe ptosis of the left upper eyelid (margin reflex distance, 4 mm in the right eye and 1 mm in the left eye). A dilated fundus examination revealed normal optic disks, maculae, and vessels. A nontender, irregular mass was palpable under the left superior orbital rim, but there was no proptosis. The temporal arteries were prominent bilaterally, more so on the right side than on the left side, with normal pulsations and no tenderness. There was no tenderness of the scalp or temporomandibular joints. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.
A review of systems was notable for fatigue and weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past year, which the patient attributed to inactivity and decreased appetite. There was a 2-month history of bilateral jaw pain with chewing of firm foods but not with soft foods. There was lateral hip soreness in both hips after walking but no stiffness. There was a sensation of locking when flexing or extending the right first finger. Two days before evaluation, the patient had a temporal headache on the right side that resolved. He reported no numbness or weakness.
The patient had a history of presbyopia. He had not undergone any surgeries, was not currently taking any medications, and had no known allergies. He was born and raised in a country in Eurasia and had lived in the United States for 20 years. He traveled internationally for his work as a university professor. He was divorced and lived with his two children in a house in New England. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes for 5 years but had quit smoking 20 years earlier. He drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. His parents were alive and well, both of his grandmothers had had breast cancer, and there was no family history of ocular or autoimmune disease.
Laboratory evaluation revealed normocytic anemia and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Results of tests of kidney and thyroid function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, creatine kinase, homocysteine, and lipoprotein(a). Testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative, and levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Aspirin was administered, along with empirical treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.

Dr. Hillary R. Kelly: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits (Figure 1), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed enlargement of the right medial rectus muscle with stranding of the adjacent extraconal fat, as well as an enhancing masslike lesion in the left anterior superior orbit, abutting the left lacrimal gland. The masslike lesion showed a hypointense signal on short-tau inversion recovery imaging. The brain parenchyma was normal. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck was normal, as was ultrasonography of the temporal arteries. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed markedly heterogeneous liver parenchyma and an enlarged periportal lymph node, measuring 2 cm in largest dimension. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple punctate calcifications throughout the liver and hypoattenuation of the right hepatic lobe, as well as diffuse coalescent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications. There was a prominent right hilar lymph node, measuring 10 mm in diameter. The lung parenchyma was unremarkable.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies.
Dr. Serling-Boyd: On the second hospital day, diplopia occurred when the patient looked to the far right. On examination, there was mild limitation of abduction of the right eye. After a second dose of intravenous methylprednisolone was administered, the patient chose to leave the hospital against medical advice. After discharge, he took prednisone daily. During the next week, additional laboratory test results became available. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) was negative. Blood testing for blastomyces antigen, coccidioides antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies was negative, as was an interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Systemic primary amyloidosis.
Case 2-2021: A 26-Year-Old Pregnant Woman with Ventricular Tachycardia and Shock,"Dr. Sunu S. Thomas: A 26-year-old pregnant woman was transferred to this hospital for evaluation and treatment of cardiogenic shock after a cardiac arrest resulting from ventricular tachycardia.
The patient had had two previous uncomplicated pregnancies and was currently pregnant at 32 weeks of gestation with monochorionic, diamniotic twins. Her pregnancy had been monitored for polyhydramnios by her obstetrician with the use of serial fetal ultrasonography.
Three weeks before presentation to this hospital, one of the patient’s preschool-age children had an ear infection and the other had a sore throat. The patient had erythema in the eyes with greenish drainage, for which topical erythromycin and sulfacetamide were prescribed. One week later, a nonproductive cough complicated by a sore throat and ear pain developed. The patient also noted new edema in her legs that was not associated with pain, redness, or warmth. However, during the subsequent week, progressive pain in her right leg occurred, which prompted her to seek care at an emergency department of another hospital.
On examination, the temperature was 37.0°C, the pulse 113 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Pitting edema of the legs was noted, with no associated erythema, warmth, or tenderness on palpation of the calves. Ultrasonography of the right leg reportedly showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and a rapid test for streptococcal antigen was negative. While the patient was in the emergency department, painful uterine contractions with back discomfort developed; the cervix was 2 cm dilated. She was admitted to the labor and delivery unit for management of preterm labor. Intramuscular betamethasone and magnesium sulfate were administered for maturation of the fetal lungs and tocolysis, respectively. Continuous intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer’s solution was initiated. Subcutaneous heparin was not administered, because delivery was thought to be imminent. After 24 hours of magnesium sulfate therapy, the uterine contractions remained unchanged, and no further cervical dilatation was noted. Because of concern about preterm labor, she remained hospitalized, with continuous monitoring of the fetal heart rate.
Five days after admission to the labor and delivery unit, the patient had tenderness in the left leg, and the edema in both legs had worsened. She also had episodes of severe coughing but reported no chest pain or shortness of breath. On examination, the temperature was 36.9°C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/51 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed expiratory wheezes. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Doppler ultrasound examination of the legs revealed an occlusive thrombus in the left peroneal vein. The hematology service was consulted, and an intravenous heparin infusion was initiated. Intravenous furosemide and oral azithromycin and guaifenesin were also administered.

The next morning, after the patient had eaten breakfast, she had sudden severe, “crushing” chest pain and became unresponsive and pulseless. Telemetry revealed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 178 beats per minute, with a right bundle-branch block pattern with a superior axis. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and after the administration of epinephrine and cardioversion, the return of spontaneous circulation was achieved within 4 minutes. Intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, propofol, and fentanyl were administered. The trachea was intubated, and ventilatory support was initiated. An emergency cesarean section was performed, and two healthy male infants were delivered, with an estimated intraoperative blood loss of 1600 ml. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Andrew S. Fox: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening, findings that were consistent with pulmonary edema; bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion; cardiomegaly with biventricular enlargement; and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery, which measured 3.8 cm in diameter. No pulmonary embolus was identified.
FIGURE 1

Imaging Studies of the Chest.
Dr. Thomas: A transthoracic echocardiogram showed biventricular dilatation and severely decreased biventricular systolic function, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion. Furosemide was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to a nearby tertiary care center for further treatment.
On arrival at the second hospital, 210 minutes after the cardiac arrest, the pulse was 177 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure was 65 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. Physical examination was notable for diffusely coarse breath sounds, rapid regular heart sounds, and generalized edema. Thirty minutes after arrival at the second hospital, the patient underwent cannulation for femoral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and an intravenous infusion of milrinone was initiated. Ventricular tachycardia recurred; intravenous magnesium and lidocaine were administered, and the arrhythmia was terminated with cardioversion. Plans were made to transfer the patient by helicopter to this hospital, and intravenous vecuronium was given in preparation for transport. During the flight, severe vaginal bleeding developed, and 2 units of packed red cells were transfused; however, the heparin infusion was continued, given the presence of the ECMO circuit.
On arrival at this hospital, 10 hours after the cardiac arrest, additional information was obtained from the patient’s sister and grandmother. The patient had a history of childhood asthma, obesity, anxiety, and depression. She had previously delivered two healthy, full-term children; her current pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus and polyhydramnios of one of the fetuses. Her medication history included insulin, inhaled albuterol, sertraline, iron sulfate, and folic acid. She had had no known adverse drug reactions. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was married and had two healthy preschool-age children, in addition to her two newborns. Her mother had died from ovarian cancer; her sister was healthy.
On examination, the temperature was 36.2°C, the pulse 123 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure 76 mm Hg without intrinsic arterial pulsatility while the patient was receiving ECMO support. The respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was receiving oxygen through volume assist–control mechanical ventilation, with a delivered tidal volume of 290 ml and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0. The weight was 105 kg, the height 163 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 39.5. The central venous pressure was 4 mm Hg. The pupils were equal and briskly reactive to light; once the patient was weaned off propofol, she was able to follow commands and move her arms and legs. Breath sounds were coarse bilaterally and diminished at the bases. Heart sounds were distant. The abdomen was soft and obese; no active bleeding was noted from the surgical incision, but large-volume vaginal bleeding and clots were observed. The arms and legs were warm and had moderate symmetric pitting edema. The femoral venous and arterial cannulas were secured in place in the right groin. The blood level of thyrotropin was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for influenza viruses, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus were negative.
Dr. Fox: Chest radiography (Figure 1C), performed at the time of transfer to this hospital, revealed interstitial opacities, a small left pleural effusion, and a dense retrocardiac opacity on the left side. The venous ECMO drainage cannula and a central venous catheter were visible in the right atrium.
Dr. Thomas: An electrocardiogram (Figure 2A) showed normal sinus rhythm, right bundle-branch block, borderline-low QRS voltage, and Q waves with T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads.
FIGURE 2

Cardiac Studies.
Dr. Doreen DeFaria Yeh: Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 2B; and Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org), performed while the patient was receiving ECMO support, revealed a dilated left ventricular cavity with normal wall thickness and severe diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis that was most prominent in the anterior, anteroseptal, and lateral territories, with an estimated ejection fraction of 11%. Additional notable findings included moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, moderate right ventricular dysfunction and dilatation, an estimated pulmonary-artery systolic pressure of 53 mm Hg, a small pericardial effusion, and a pleural effusion. The ECMO inflow cannula was visualized in the inferior vena cava, and consistent with systemic ECMO blood flows, the aortic valve was observed not to open during the cardiac cycle, which suggested very poor native left ventricular contraction. There was no evidence of intracardiac shunting.
Dr. Thomas: The dose of milrinone was increased, and the dopamine infusion was discontinued. An oxytocin infusion and rectal misoprostol were administered. Ongoing large-volume vaginal bleeding was observed, and an intrauterine balloon was placed to control the bleeding.
A diagnosis and management decisions were made.","Pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction, probably due to spontaneous coronary-artery dissection."
Case 1-2021: A 76-Year-Old Woman with Lethargy and Altered Mental Status,"Dr. Natasha Merali (Medicine): A 76-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of lethargy and altered mental status.
The patient had been well until 2 months before this evaluation, when she was admitted to another hospital for community-acquired pneumonia. Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin was administered, and her condition partially improved.
Two weeks later, the patient presented to the other hospital with recurrent dyspnea and lethargy. A partly loculated right pleural effusion was identified. Empirical treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam was administered intravenously. Thoracostomy (placement of a chest tube for drainage) was performed, and pleural fluid analysis revealed an exudative pleural effusion; Gram’s staining showed no neutrophils or microorganisms, culture showed no growth, and cytologic testing showed no malignant cells. After a 1-week admission, the dyspnea abated, and the patient was discharged with instructions to complete a 2-week course of antibiotic therapy.
Two weeks before this evaluation, generalized weakness and lethargy developed, along with new diffuse headache. The patient’s family thought that she appeared somnolent and “clumsy” while walking. Four days later, her family took her to the other hospital for evaluation. A review of systems was notable for dyspnea, leg edema, and hematochezia and no fever, chills, chest pain, cough, dysuria, hematuria, or melena. The temperature was 37.2°C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 176/101 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented but appeared to be confused when recalling recent events. She had jugular venous distention, diffuse lung rales, and 2+ symmetric pitting edema of the lower legs up to the knees. The blood urea nitrogen level was 83 mg per deciliter (29.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 20 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 7.1 mmol per liter]), the creatinine level 4.9 mg per deciliter (433 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.4 to 1.1 mg per deciliter [35 to 97 μmol per liter]), and the hematocrit 26% (reference range, 34 to 45). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Chest radiography revealed a small right pleural effusion and moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a chronic subcortical infarct of the right frontal lobe, as well as diffuse involutional changes and nonspecific white-matter hypodensities.
Dr. Merali: Oral labetalol, clonidine, and hydralazine and intravenous furosemide were administered to treat possible hypertensive emergency. During the next 2 days, the patient’s headache and anemia worsened and dizziness developed. On the seventh hospital day, there was an acute episode of nonbloody emesis, followed by a generalized tonic–clonic seizure lasting 1 minute. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital.
Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed findings similar to those of the previous study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed two foci of restricted diffusion in the right frontal lobe and the left cerebellar hemisphere, each measuring 1 cm in diameter, with surrounding signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. In addition, there was diffuse ventricular enlargement, with surrounding smooth hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR images; this finding is suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). T2-weighted and FLAIR images also showed multiple foci of hyperintensity scattered throughout the deep white matter.
FIGURE 1

MRI of the Head.
Dr. Merali: Video electroencephalography revealed epileptiform discharges predominantly in the frontal lobe, with generalized slowing. Levetiracetam, vancomycin, and ceftazidime were administered; intermittent hemodialysis was initiated.
During the next 3 days, the patient began to have a right gaze preference, left hemineglect, and aphasia. The temperature increased to 39.4°C, and chills developed. Blood specimens were obtained for microbiologic culture. Lumbar puncture was deferred, pending additional imaging studies to rule out a space-occupying lesion. Empirical treatment with vancomycin, ceftazidime, ampicillin, metronidazole, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. At the request of her family, the patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital.
On arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from the patient’s family. Two years earlier, the patient had received a diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, which was treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin. Therapy was discontinued after three of six cycles because of ileus, renal injury, and neutropenic fever. Robotic subtotal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were then performed; histologic examination of the resected tissue revealed a nearly complete response of the adenocarcinoma. Five months before the current evaluation, CT with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)–positron-emission tomography performed at the other hospital revealed FDG avidity in nonenlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, retroperitoneum, porta hepatis, and right cervical region. Biopsy was offered, but the patient chose to undergo active surveillance. Additional medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and stage 5 chronic kidney disease. Medications included torsemide, amlodipine, clonidine, hydralazine, hydrochlorothiazide, labetalol, rosuvastatin, insulin, levothyroxine, cholecalciferol, mirtazapine, and oxycodone. There were no known drug allergies.
Four decades before the current admission, the patient had immigrated to the United States from an island off the west coast of Africa. She was widowed, had four children, and lived with a pet parrot in an urban area of New England. Two months before hospitalization, she had been independent in activities of daily living and had received minimal assistance, such as with buying groceries, from family members. The patient had traveled to her country of origin 8 years earlier and to South America and the Caribbean in the past year. She had had no sexual partners in the past three decades. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her sister had received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at 60 years of age; there was no family history of rheumatologic, neurologic, cardiovascular, or renal disease.
On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the heart rate 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure 170/92 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.8. The patient was somnolent and variably oriented to self but not to situation, location, or time. She intermittently opened her eyes spontaneously but did not follow commands or reliably withdraw in response to noxious stimuli. Her face and pupils appeared symmetric; a right gaze preference and left hemineglect were present. There was no evidence of jugular venous distention, rales, or edema, and the abdominal examination was normal.
Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2 antibodies and p24 antigen was nonreactive. A test for antitreponemal antibodies was positive, and a rapid plasma reagin test was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed foci of hypoattenuation in the left superior cerebellar hemisphere and the right frontal lobe that corresponded to the foci of restricted diffusion on MRI observed at the other hospital.
Dr. Merali: Empirical treatment with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, metronidazole, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. On the second hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 15 cm of water. The CSF was slightly yellow, with a glucose level of 18 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a protein level of 173 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were 236 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 69% were neutrophils, 19% lymphocytes, and 12% monocytes. Gram’s staining of the CSF showed abundant neutrophils and mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed mild left ventricular hypokinesis and aortic sclerosis.
On the fourth hospital day, new right esophoria developed and the patient was less responsive. The trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation was initiated for airway protection.
Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed enlargement of the previously observed lesions in the right frontal lobe and left cerebellum. There were additional foci of reduced diffusivity, with corresponding hyperintense signal abnormalities on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, involving both cerebral hemispheres, deep gray matter, the brain stem, and the cerebellum. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal narrowing of branches of the bilateral middle and posterior cerebral arteries. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and no other abnormalities.
FIGURE 2

Additional MRI of the Head.
Dr. Merali: Empirical treatment with methylprednisolone was started. The next day, repeat lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 16 cm of water. The CSF was slightly yellow, with a glucose level of 179 mg per deciliter (9.9 mmol per liter) and a protein level of 181 mg per deciliter. There were 286 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 83% were neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, and 8% monocytes. Gram’s staining of the CSF showed abundant neutrophils and moderate mononuclear cells; there were no organisms.
A diagnostic test was performed.",Mycobacterium tuberculosis meningitis.
