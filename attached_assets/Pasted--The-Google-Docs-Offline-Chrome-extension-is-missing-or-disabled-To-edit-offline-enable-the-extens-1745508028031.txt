Dr. Vandana L. Madhavan: A 30-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital for the third time in 4 weeks because of recurrent fever.
The patient had been well until 4 weeks before the current presentation, when fever, dry cough, nasal congestion, and decreased intake of solid foods developed. The next day, while he was playing in a park with his siblings, he began limping. No trauma had preceded the onset of limping. The patient’s parents brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
The patient was afebrile. He was interactive but appeared tired and walked with a limp, favoring the left leg. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The white-cell count was 28,440 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 63 mm per hour (reference range, 9 to 14), and the C-reactive protein level 31.3 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0). Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for culture, and imaging studies were obtained.

Laboratory Data.
Dr. Evan J. Zucker: Ultrasonography of the hip and radiography of the pelvis showed no abnormalities. Radiography of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed peribronchial cuffing and patchy perihilar opacities.

Imaging Studies of the Chest and Abdomen.
Dr. Madhavan: The patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, he remained afebrile, had a normal energy level, and was walking normally. Blood cultures showed no growth. He was discharged home.
Two days after discharge, fever recurred. The patient’s mother brought him back to emergency department of this hospital. The patient was afebrile, but leukocytosis and elevated levels of inflammatory markers persisted. Tests of a nasopharyngeal swab were positive for coronavirus (not severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and for human rhinovirus and enterovirus. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was again obtained for culture, and additional imaging studies were obtained.
Dr. Zucker: Ultrasonography of the abdomen (Figure 1B) revealed multiple hypoechoic splenic lesions, measuring up to 6 mm in diameter. No cholelithiasis, thickening of the gallbladder wall, or biliary ductal dilatation was present. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1C), abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, was notable for mediastinal lymphadenopathy mostly involving the paratracheal and subcarinal lymph node stations, as well as right hilar lymphadenopathy.
Dr. Madhavan: The patient was readmitted to the hospital. During the next 3 days, he had intermittent fever, which abated after the administration of ibuprofen. Blood cultures showed no growth. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was discharged home with recommendations for continued supportive care and instructions to undergo additional laboratory testing and imaging studies.
During the subsequent 3 weeks, the patient continued to have intermittent fever. On the day of the current presentation, planned outpatient laboratory testing was performed. The white-cell count was 42,390 per microliter, and the patient’s mother was asked to bring him back to the emergency department for evaluation.
The patient’s mother reported that the patient had fever once or twice daily. The episodes of fever were associated with chills, and the patient seemed averse to being held or touched. When he had no fever, he was playful and behaved normally. He had persistent dry cough, nasal congestion, and decreased intake of solid foods. There was no vomiting, diarrhea, or blood or mucus in the stool.
The patient had had normal growth and had met normal developmental milestones. He had iron-deficiency anemia. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies. Immunizations were up to date. His parents had immigrated to the United States from Central America. The patient and his siblings had been born in the United States, lived in a suburban area of New England, and had not traveled outside the region. His parents and older sister were healthy. One older brother had developmental delay and sensorineural hearing loss of unknown cause. Three and a half years before the patient’s current presentation, another older brother had received a diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection at 31 months of age.
On examination, the axillary temperature was 40.2°C, the blood pressure 131/61 mm Hg, the pulse 180 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 55 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was crying but consolable. Breathing was normal, without grunting or intercostal retractions, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There was palpable right axillary lymphadenopathy; he resisted examination of the left axilla. No cervical or inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted. No focal tenderness on palpation of the arms, legs, or joints was present, and there was no rash.
Dr. Zucker: Radiography of the chest revealed an opacity in the right lower lobe. Subsequent CT of the chest, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 1D), revealed multifocal pulmonary opacities with a basilar predominance in both lungs, along with lymphadenopathy that was relatively unchanged from that observed on previous CT imaging.
Dr. Madhavan: Administration of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula was initiated at a rate of 1 liter per minute. The patient was readmitted to the hospital.
