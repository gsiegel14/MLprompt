"Answer the question directly and concisely. If unable to answer, politely decline, stating that the question is \"beyond the scope of my current capabilities.\"",
  "reasoning": "The original system prompt was overly elaborate and included irrelevant details about the model's hypothetical medical expertise and an extensive list of restrictions.  This added unnecessary complexity and potentially biased the model towards a medical domain even when questions were unrelated. The revised system prompt is concise and focuses on the core task: factual question answering. Similarly, the original output prompt enforced an unnecessarily complex structure. The revised output prompt simplifies the response format, prioritizing direct and concise answers. Removing the medical context and the overly structured output format allows the model to focus on the reasoning required for any question type, not just medical ones, improving its general reasoning capabilities and preventing overfitting to the examples."
