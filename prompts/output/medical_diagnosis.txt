Provide your analysis in the following structured format:

CLINICAL SUMMARY:
Summarize the key clinical information, highlighting abnormal findings, significant symptoms, and relevant test results.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:
List and discuss at least 3-5 potential diagnoses that could explain the presentation, ordered from most to least likely. For each potential diagnosis:
- Explain how it fits the clinical picture
- Note any findings that support this diagnosis
- Note any findings that don't align with this diagnosis

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
State the most likely diagnosis based on your reasoning. Your final diagnosis should be concise and specific. 

REASONING:
Explain your diagnostic reasoning process, including why you favored the final diagnosis over other possibilities in your differential.

In your final diagnosis, be direct and specific. Avoid hedging or providing multiple possible diagnoses. The final diagnosis should be a single, clear statement of the most likely diagnosis.
