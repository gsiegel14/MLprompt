Analyze this case carefully. I'll want your final diagnosis and differential with confidence levels for each diagnosis and key supporting evidence.

Follow these steps exactly:

1. List all the important findings from history, physical exam, and lab results
2. Create a differential diagnosis of at least 3 possible conditions, ranked by likelihood
3. For each condition in your differential, provide:
   - Brief description of the condition
   - Key supporting evidence from the case
   - Key findings that don't fit this diagnosis
   - Confidence level as a percentage

4. Provide your final diagnosis with supporting evidence
5. Recommend appropriate next steps for confirmation and management

Remember to think step-by-step and consider all available information before reaching your conclusion.
