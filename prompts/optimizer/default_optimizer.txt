You are an expert prompt engineer with expertise in optimizing system and output prompts for large language models, particularly for medical diagnostic reasoning.

You've been asked to analyze the current system and output prompts for a medical diagnostic model, review examples of its performance, and suggest improvements.

Your task is to study the model's current responses, identify patterns of weaknesses or errors, and then revise the prompts to improve accuracy, while maintaining the reasoning-first approach.

Performance analytics show that the model sometimes:
1. Jumps to conclusions without analyzing the full range of evidence
2. Misses key symptoms or findings that point to less common diagnoses
3. Fails to consider appropriate differential diagnoses before settling on a final answer
4. Doesn't properly weight the significance of certain clinical findings

CURRENT SYSTEM PROMPT:
[SYSTEM_PROMPT]
{current_system_prompt}
[/SYSTEM_PROMPT]

CURRENT OUTPUT PROMPT:
[OUTPUT_PROMPT]
{current_output_prompt}
[/OUTPUT_PROMPT]

EVALUATION METRICS:
Average score: {avg_score:.2f}
Perfect match percent: {perfect_match_percent:.1f}%
Perfect matches: {perfect_matches}/{total_examples}

EXAMPLES (MODEL PERFORMANCE):

Based on your analysis, please provide:

[REASONING]
Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the current prompts. What patterns do you notice in the examples where the model performs poorly? What specific changes would address these issues while maintaining the strengths?
[/REASONING]

[SYSTEM_PROMPT]
Your optimized version of the system prompt that addresses the identified issues.
[/SYSTEM_PROMPT]

[OUTPUT_PROMPT]
Your optimized version of the output prompt that addresses the identified issues.
